Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.Return the integer as the final result.Note:Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
A digit string is good if the digits (0-indexed) at even indices are even and the digits at odd indices are prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).For example, "2582" is good because the digits (2 and 8) at even positions are even and the digits (5 and 2) at odd positions are prime. However, "3245" is not good because 3 is at an even index but is not even.Given an integer n, return the total number of good digit strings of length n. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.A digit string is a string consisting of digits 0 through 9 that may contain leading zeros.

SQL SchemaTable: Prices+---------------+---------+| Column Name   | Type    |+---------------+---------+| product_id    | int     || start_date    | date    || end_date      | date    || price         | int     |+---------------+---------+(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table.Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.Table: UnitsSold+---------------+---------+| Column Name   | Type    |+---------------+---------+| product_id    | int     || purchase_date | date    || units         | int     |+---------------+---------+There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold.Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.Return the result table in any order.The query result format is in the following example.
You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.To complete the ith replacement operation:Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s.If it does not occur, do nothing.Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i].For example, if s = "abcd", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = "ab", and targets[i] = "eee", then the result of this replacement will be "eeecd".All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.For example, a testcase with s = "abc", indices = [0, 1], and sources = ["ab","bc"] will not be generated because the "ab" and "bc" replacements overlap.Return the resulting string after performing all replacement operations on s.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Let's define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s.For example, calling countUniqueChars(s) if s = "LEETCODE" then "L", "T", "C", "O", "D" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.Given a string s, return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s. The test cases are generated such that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.The game ends when you reach the square n2.A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1.

Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.
Given two strings s and t, your goal is to convert s into t in k moves or less.During the ith (1 <= i <= k) move you can:Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1 <= j <= s.length and j has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.Do nothing.Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.Return true if it's possible to convert s into t in no more than k moves, otherwise return false.

You are given an m x n grid grid where:'.' is an empty cell.'#' is a wall.'@' is the starting point.Lowercase letters represent keys.Uppercase letters represent locks.You start at the starting point and one move consists of walking one space in one of the four cardinal directions. You cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.If you walk over a key, you can pick it up and you cannot walk over a lock unless you have its corresponding key.For some 1 <= k <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first k letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it is impossible, return -1.
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).

You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.
Design a food rating system that can do the following:Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.Implement the FoodRatings class:FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) Initializes the system. The food items are described by foods, cuisines and ratings, all of which have a length of n.foods[i] is the name of the ith food,cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the ith food, andratings[i] is the initial rating of the ith food.void changeRating(String food, int newRating) Changes the rating of the food item with the name food.String highestRated(String cuisine) Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of cuisine.

Given a 2D array of characters grid of size m x n, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in grid.A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the same value of the current cell.Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) is invalid because from (1, 2) we visited (1, 1) which was the last visited cell.Return true if any cycle of the same value exists in grid, otherwise, return false.
You are given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from the array and then sorted them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2 numbers.Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in the new array. Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 109 + 7.
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d), or (a == d and b == c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].

Given an expression such as expression = "e + 8 - a + 5" and an evaluation map such as {"e": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = ["e"] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as ["-1*a","14"]An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like "2x" or "-x".Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.For example, expression = "1 + 2 * 3" has an answer of ["7"].The format of the output is as follows:For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.For example, we would never write a term like "b*a*c", only "a*b*c".Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.For example, "a*a*b*c" has degree 4.The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.An example of a well-formatted answer is ["-2*a*a*a", "3*a*a*b", "3*b*b", "4*a", "5*c", "-6"].Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.For example, an expression of "0" has an output of [].Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.
Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make arr1 strictly increasing.In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j].If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing, return -1.
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1 in the shortest amount of time.Return the number of ways you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
The min-product of an array is equal to the minimum value in the array multiplied by the array's sum.For example, the array [3,2,5] (minimum value is 2) has a min-product of 2 * (3+2+5) = 2 * 10 = 20.Given an array of integers nums, return the maximum min-product of any non-empty subarray of nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.Note that the min-product should be maximized before performing the modulo operation. Testcases are generated such that the maximum min-product without modulo will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.Finally, represent the product as a string "<pre>...<suf>eC".For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as "12345...89876e5".Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Design a data structure to track the ranges represented as half-open intervals and query about them.A half-open interval [left, right) denotes all the real numbers x where left <= x < right.Implement the RangeModule class:RangeModule() Initializes the object of the data structure.void addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right), tracking every real number in that interval.

The ith event starts at startTimei and ends at endTimei, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei. You can choose at most two non-overlapping events to attend such that the sum of their values is maximized.Return this maximum sum.Note that the start time and end time is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time t, the next event must start at or after t + 1.
Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1's present when written in binary.For example, 21 written in binary is 10101, which has 3 set bits.
A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.class Node {public boolean val;public boolean isLeaf;public Node topLeft;public Node topRight;public Node bottomLeft;public Node bottomRight;}We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.Quad-Tree format:The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)

Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :p[0] = startp[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation.p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
You are given the root of a binary tree and a positive integer k.The level sum in the tree is the sum of the values of the nodes that are on the same level.Return the kth largest level sum in the tree (not necessarily distinct). If there are fewer than k levels in the tree, return -1.Note that two nodes are on the same level if they have the same distance from the root.
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.There are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may value the stones differently.You are given two integer arrays of length n, aliceValues and bobValues. Each aliceValues[i] and bobValues[i] represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the ith stone.The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play optimally. Both players know the other's values.Determine the result of the game, and:If Alice wins, return 1.If Bob wins, return -1.If the game results in a draw, return 0.
There is a network of n servers, labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates there is a message channel between servers ui and vi, and they can pass any number of messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n.All servers are connected, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.The server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server.Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.Return the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.Note:Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}". For example, "0:start:3" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and "1:end:2" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
You are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.More formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
You are given a positive integer p. Consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:Choose two elements x and y from nums.Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.For example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.Find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 109 + 7.Note: The answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done.
Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.
You are given an integer array nums and an integer goal.You want to choose a subsequence of nums such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to goal. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is sum, then you want to minimize the absolute difference abs(sum - goal).Return the minimum possible value of abs(sum - goal).Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.
You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.You then do the following steps:If original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).Otherwise, stop the process.Repeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.Return the final value of original.
Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10n.
You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.
You are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.Initially every student has 0 points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.You are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. The ID of each student is unique.Given an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

You are given a string s (0-indexed). You are asked to perform the following operation on s until you get a sorted string:Find the largest index i such that 1 <= i < s.length and s[i] < s[i - 1].Find the largest index j such that i <= j < s.length and s[k] < s[i - 1] for all the possible values of k in the range [i, j] inclusive.Swap the two characters at indices i - 1 and j.Reverse the suffix starting at index i.Return the number of operations needed to make the string sorted. Since the answer can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
You are given an integer n. You have an n x n binary grid grid with all values initially 1's except for some indices given in the array mines. The ith element of the array mines is defined as mines[i] = [xi, yi] where grid[xi][yi] == 0.Return the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1's contained in grid. If there is none, return 0.An axis-aligned plus sign of 1's of order k has some center grid[r][c] == 1 along with four arms of length k - 1 going up, down, left, and right, and made of 1's. Note that there could be 0's or 1's beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for 1's.
Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
You are given two positive integer arrays nums and target, of the same length.In one operation, you can choose any two distinct indices i and j where 0 <= i, j < nums.length and:set nums[i] = nums[i] + 2 andset nums[j] = nums[j] - 2.Two arrays are considered to be similar if the frequency of each element is the same.Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums similar to target. The test cases are generated such that nums can always be similar to target.
Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.Implement the SummaryRanges class:SummaryRanges() Initializes the object with an empty stream.void addNum(int value) Adds the integer value to the stream.int[][] getIntervals() Returns a summary of the integers in the stream currently as a list of disjoint intervals [starti, endi]. The answer should be sorted by starti.
You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]. The ith event starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei. You are also given an integer k which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.

You have n dice, and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.Implement the RLEIterator class:RLEIterator(int[] encoded) Initializes the object with the encoded array encoded.int next(int n) Exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.
A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i] * satisfaction[i].Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.
You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is the number of elements that will be in the array at time i. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you can resize the array (to any size).The size of the array at time t, sizet, must be at least nums[t] because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The space wasted at time t is defined as sizet - nums[t], and the total space wasted is the sum of the space wasted across every time t where 0 <= t < nums.length.Return the minimum total space wasted if you can resize the array at most k times.Note: The array can have any size at the start and does not count towards the number of resizing operations.
Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)
An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.For example, one way to encode an original string "abcdefghijklmnop" might be:Split it as a sequence: ["ab", "cdefghijklmn", "o", "p"].Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes ["ab", "12", "1", "p"].Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: "ab121p".Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.

Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.
Given an integer n represented as a string, return the smallest good base of n.We call k >= 2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1's.
Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.orgThe philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.
You are given an integer total indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers cost1 and cost2 indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend part or all of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.Return the number of distinct ways you can buy some number of pens and pencils.
You are participating in an online chess tournament. There is a chess round that starts every 15 minutes. The first round of the day starts at 00:00, and after every 15 minutes, a new round starts.For example, the second round starts at 00:15, the fourth round starts at 00:45, and the seventh round starts at 01:30.You are given two strings loginTime and logoutTime where:loginTime is the time you will login to the game, andlogoutTime is the time you will logout from the game.If logoutTime is earlier than loginTime, this means you have played from loginTime to midnight and from midnight to logoutTime.Return the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament.Note: All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at 00:00 and the last round of the day starts at 23:45.

If no palindromes can be constructed, return 0.A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from s without changing the order of the remaining characters.A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.
Given a string s, determine if it is valid.A string s is valid if, starting with an empty string t = "", you can transform t into s after performing the following operation any number of times:Insert string "abc" into any position in t.

These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.

If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.
There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.Return true if and only if it is bipartite.
Given a binary treestruct Node {int val;Node *left;Node *right;Node *next;}Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
Given an m x n matrix board where each cell is a battleship 'X' or empty '.', return the number of the battleships on board.Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on board. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1 x k (1 row, k columns) or k x 1 (k rows, 1 column), where k can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).
You are given four integers row, cols, rCenter, and cCenter. There is a rows x cols matrix and you are on the cell with the coordinates (rCenter, cCenter).Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from (rCenter, cCenter) from the smallest distance to the largest distance.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a 0-indexed integer array answer where:answer.length == nums.length.answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.Where:leftSum[i] is the sum of elements to the left of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, leftSum[i] = 0.rightSum[i] is the sum of elements to the right of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, rightSum[i] = 0.Return the array answer.
Given an array nums that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to n. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of nums in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder nums so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array nums.For example, given nums = [2,1,3], we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array [2,3,1] also yields the same BST but [3,2,1] yields a different BST.Return the number of ways to reorder nums such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from nums.Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (occupied).You are then given stamps of size stampHeight x stampWidth. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given restrictions and requirements:Cover all the empty cells.Do not cover any of the occupied cells.We can put as many stamps as we want.Stamps can overlap with each other.Stamps are not allowed to be rotated.Stamps must stay completely inside the grid.Return true if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return false.
There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:multiply the number on display by 2, orsubtract 1 from the number on display.Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.
SQL SchemaTable: Queue+-------------+---------+| Column Name | Type    |+-------------+---------+| person_id   | int     || person_name | varchar || weight      | int     || turn        | int     |+-------------+---------+person_id is the primary key column for this table.This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.The query result format is in the following example.
We have an array of integers, nums, and an array of requests where requests[i] = [starti, endi]. The ith request asks for the sum of nums[starti] + nums[starti + 1] + ... + nums[endi - 1] + nums[endi]. Both starti and endi are 0-indexed.Return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of nums.Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
SQL SchemaTable: Customer+---------------+---------+| Column Name   | Type    |+---------------+---------+| customer_id   | int     || name          | varchar || visited_on    | date    || amount        | int     |+---------------+---------+(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.amount is the total paid by a customer.You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).Write an SQL query to compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.Return result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.The query result format is in the following example.
Given the root of a binary tree, construct a 0-indexed m x n string matrix res that represents a formatted layout of the tree. The formatted layout matrix should be constructed using the following rules:The height of the tree is height and the number of rows m should be equal to height + 1.The number of columns n should be equal to 2height+1 - 1.Place the root node in the middle of the top row (more formally, at location res[0][(n-1)/2]).For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position res[r][c], place its left child at res[r+1][c-2height-r-1] and its right child at res[r+1][c+2height-r-1].Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.Any empty cells should contain the empty string "".Return the constructed matrix res.
You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings startWords and targetWords. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.For each string in targetWords, check if it is possible to choose a string from startWords and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that from targetWords.The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.For example, if the string is "abc", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be "abcd".Rearrange the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.For example, "abcd" can be rearranged to "acbd", "bacd", "cbda", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to "abcd" itself.Return the number of strings in targetWords that can be obtained by performing the operations on any string of startWords.Note that you will only be verifying if the string in targetWords can be obtained from a string in startWords by performing the operations. The strings in startWords do not actually change during this process.

You are given a string s that consists of only digits.Check if we can split s into two or more non-empty substrings such that the numerical values of the substrings are in descending order and the difference between numerical values of every two adjacent substrings is equal to 1.For example, the string s = "0090089" can be split into ["0090", "089"] with numerical values [90,89]. The values are in descending order and adjacent values differ by 1, so this way is valid.Another example, the string s = "001" can be split into ["0", "01"], ["00", "1"], or ["0", "0", "1"]. However all the ways are invalid because they have numerical values [0,1], [0,1], and [0,0,1] respectively, all of which are not in descending order.Return true if it is possible to split s as described above, or false otherwise.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.It is guaranteed that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.A binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of Node.left has a value strictly less than Node.val, and any descendant of Node.right has a value strictly greater than Node.val.A preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses Node.left, then traverses Node.right.

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.Build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.For example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.

All the values leaveTimei are unique.Note that the ith task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)th task ends, and the 0th task starts at time 0.Return the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time. If there is a tie between two or more employees, return the smallest id among them.
You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.For example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba", constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.

Given a (0-indexed) integer array nums and two integers low and high, return the number of nice pairs.A nice pair is a pair (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high.
A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.Implement the CustomStack class:CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.
Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:/a/a/x/a/x/y/a/z/b/b/x/b/x/y/b/zHowever, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders "/a" and "/b" would not be identical. Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks at the same time. You are given a 2D integer array tasks where tasks[i] = [starti, endi, durationi] indicates that the ith task should run for a total of durationi seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the inclusive time range [starti, endi].You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.Return the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks.
There is a rooted tree consisting of n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. Each node's number denotes its unique genetic value (i.e. the genetic value of node x is x). The genetic difference between two genetic values is defined as the bitwise-XOR of their values. You are given the integer array parents, where parents[i] is the parent for node i. If node x is the root of the tree, then parents[x] == -1.You are also given the array queries where queries[i] = [nodei, vali]. For each query i, find the maximum genetic difference between vali and pi, where pi is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between nodei and the root (including nodei and the root). More formally, you want to maximize vali XOR pi.Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.
Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.Note:A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.The input array words contains at least one word.
Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.
Given a string s, return the last substring of s in lexicographical order.
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

You are given the string croakOfFrogs, which represents a combination of the string "croak" from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same time, so multiple "croak" are mixed.Return the minimum number of different frogs to finish all the croaks in the given string.A valid "croak" means a frog is printing five letters 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' sequentially. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak. If the given string is not a combination of a valid "croak" return -1.
Given an integer n, return the largest palindromic integer that can be represented as the product of two n-digits integers. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 1337.

Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.
You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays servers and tasks of lengths n and m respectively. servers[i] is the weight of the ith server, and tasks[j] is the time needed to process the jth task in seconds.Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.A server that is assigned task j at second t will be free again at second t + tasks[j].Build an array ans of length m, where ans[j] is the index of the server the jth task will be assigned to.Return the array ans.
You are given a strictly increasing integer array rungs that represents the height of rungs on a ladder. You are currently on the floor at height 0, and you want to reach the last rung.You are also given an integer dist.

You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of the ith node. The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.The data structure should support the following functions:Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:The node is unlocked,It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), andIt does not have any locked ancestors.Implement the LockingTree class:LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise.

If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.
You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, andworker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.Given an integer array rains where:rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.Return an array ans where:ans.length == rains.lengthans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.

In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be "Radiant" or "Dire".

Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.Return the result table ordered by employee_id.The query result format is in the following example.
Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.Return the following:If version1 < version2, return -1.If version1 > version2, return 1.Otherwise, return 0.

We want to apply operations so that the new expression evaluates to 0.The cost of changing the final value of an expression is the number of operations performed on the expression. The types of operations are described as follows:Turn a '1' into a '0'.Turn a '0' into a '1'.Turn a '&' into a '|'.Turn a '|' into a '&'.Note: '&' does not take precedence over '|' in the order of calculation. Evaluate parentheses first, then in left-to-right order.

There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem.

Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:|a - x| < |b - x|, or|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where '#' represents a null node.Given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.It is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.You may assume that the input format is always valid.For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as "1,,3".Note: You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.
Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.Note that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.
Given an array of digits digits, return the largest multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in any order.

You are given a network of n nodes represented as an n x n adjacency matrix graph, where the ith node is directly connected to the jth node if graph[i][j] == 1.Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected, and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops.We will remove exactly one node from initial, completely removing it and any connections from this node to any other node.Return the node that, if removed, would minimize M(initial). If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.
SQL SchemaTable: Activity+----------------+---------+| Column Name    | Type    |+----------------+---------+| machine_id     | int     || process_id     | int     || activity_type  | enum    || timestamp      | float   |+----------------+---------+The table shows the user activities for a factory website.(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table.machine_id is the ID of a machine.process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.activity_type is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end').timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write an SQL query to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.Return the result table in any order.The query result format is in the following example.

If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.Rank should be as small as possible.
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.A sentence is circular if:The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.

An integer x is a good if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from x. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves,2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored),6 and 9 rotate to each other, andthe rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.Given an integer n, return the number of good integers in the range [1, n].

Returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise.bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains.You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average O(1) time complexity.Note: The test cases are generated such that getRandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the RandomizedCollection.

Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.

You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or1 if it is a batch of sell orders.Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog.

You are given an integer array stones, the positions of the stones.Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position. In one move, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).Return an integer array answer of length 2 where:answer[0] is the minimum number of moves you can play, andanswer[1] is the maximum number of moves you can play.

Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):dir⟶ subdir1⟶ ⟶ file1.ext⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1⟶ subdir2⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.extIf we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.

There are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules.There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.In other words:If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.Implement the MyCircularQueue class:MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.

You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top.To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.For example, "ABC" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from "BAC" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom.You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.Given bottom and allowed, return true if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular pattern in the pyramid is in allowed, or false otherwise.

In an n*n grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at (0, 0) and (0, 1). The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at (n-1, n-2) and (n-1, n-1).In one move the snake can:Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from (r, c) and (r, c+1) to (r, c) and (r+1, c).Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from (r, c) and (r+1, c) to (r, c) and (r, c+1).Return the minimum number of moves to reach the target.If there is no way to reach the target, return -1.

You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point [0, 0], and you are given a destination point target = [xtarget, ytarget] that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array ghosts, where ghosts[i] = [xi, yi] represents the starting position of the ith ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates.Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously.You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.Return true if it is possible to escape regardless of how the ghosts move, otherwise return false.
Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example:"hello" -> "heeellooo""hi" -> "hiiii"In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo". If s = "helllllooo", then the query word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = s.Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.
You are given a string s and array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti, ki]. We may rearrange the substring s[lefti...righti] for each query and then choose up to ki of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.Return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is the result of the ith query queries[i].Note that each letter is counted individually for replacement, so if, for example s[lefti...righti] = "aaa", and ki = 2, we can only replace two of the letters. Also, note that no query modifies the initial string s.
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Note that points that lie on the edges of a rectangle are also considered to be contained by that rectangle.
You are given an array nums. You can rotate it by a non-negative integer k so that the array becomes [nums[k], nums[k + 1], ... nums[nums.length - 1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]. Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].Return the rotation index k that corresponds to the highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it.

Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.

A string originalText is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string encodedText with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows rows.originalText is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of originalText. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with ' '. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in originalText.encodedText is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.The characters in the blue cells are appended first to encodedText, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.For example, if originalText = "cipher" and rows = 3, then we encode it in the following manner:The blue arrows depict how originalText is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which encodedText is formed. In the above example, encodedText = "ch ie pr".Given the encoded string encodedText and number of rows rows, return the original string originalText.Note: originalText does not have any trailing spaces ' '. The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible originalText.

Design a data structure that keeps track of the values in it and answers some queries regarding their frequencies.Implement the FrequencyTracker class.FrequencyTracker(): Initializes the FrequencyTracker object with an empty array initially.void add(int number): Adds number to the data structure.void deleteOne(int number): Deletes one occurrence of number from the data structure. The data structure may not contain number, and in this case nothing is deleted.bool hasFrequency(int frequency): Returns true if there is a number in the data structure that occurs frequency number of times, otherwise, it returns false.
Given an array of integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:i + x where: i + x < arr.length and  0 < x <= d.i - x where: i - x >= 0 and  0 < x <= d.In addition, you can only jump from index i to index j if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)).You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indices you can visit.Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.
The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order.For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11.Given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
You are given a very large integer n, represented as a string, and an integer digit x. The digits in n and the digit x are in the inclusive range [1, 9], and n may represent a negative number.You want to maximize n's numerical value by inserting x anywhere in the decimal representation of n. You cannot insert x to the left of the negative sign.For example, if n = 73 and x = 6, it would be best to insert it between 7 and 3, making n = 763.If n = -55 and x = 2, it would be best to insert it before the first 5, making n = -255.Return a string representing the maximum value of n after the insertion.
There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

Given a string formula representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom.The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow.For example, "H2O" and "H2O2" are possible, but "H1O2" is impossible.Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.For example, "H2O2He3Mg4" is also a formula.A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.For example, "(H2O2)" and "(H2O2)3" are formulas.Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.The test cases are generated so that all the values in the output fit in a 32-bit integer.
A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point (0, 0) facing north. The robot can receive a sequence of these three possible types of commands:-2: Turn left 90 degrees.-1: Turn right 90 degrees.1 <= k <= 9: Move forward k units, one unit at a time.Some of the grid squares are obstacles. The ith obstacle is at grid point obstacles[i] = (xi, yi). If the robot runs into an obstacle, then it will instead stay in its current location and move on to the next command.Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot ever gets from the origin squared (i.e. if the distance is 5, return 25).Note:North means +Y direction.East means +X direction.South means -Y direction.West means -X direction.
Given a 2D integer array circles where circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri] represents the center (xi, yi) and radius ri of the ith circle drawn on a grid, return the number of lattice points that are present inside at least one circle.Note:A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.Points that lie on the circumference of a circle are also considered to be inside it.
There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard.When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.Return the number of valid move combinations.Notes:No two pieces will start in the same square.You may choose the square a piece is already on as its destination.If two pieces are directly adjacent to each other, it is valid for them to move past each other and swap positions in one second.
There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.Return the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted). You may return the segments in any order.A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between points a and b including point a and not including point b.

There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to d.Return an array of size n-1 where the dth element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d.Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.

On each turn:Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.For example, these are arithmetic sequences:1, 3, 5, 7, 97, 7, 7, 73, -1, -5, -9The following sequence is not arithmetic:1, 1, 2, 5, 7You are given an array of n integers, nums, and two arrays of m integers each, l and r, representing the m range queries, where the ith query is the range [l[i], r[i]]. All the arrays are 0-indexed.Return a list of boolean elements answer, where answer[i] is true if the subarray nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]] can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and false otherwise.
Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree. We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree. n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x. The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.You are the second player. If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true. If it is not possible, return false.
You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland.To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups.

You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.The game goes on as follows:Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.

You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color.The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your inventory. For example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own. You are also given an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

For elements less than pivot, if i < j and nums[i] < pivot and nums[j] < pivot, then pi < pj. Similarly for elements greater than pivot, if i < j and nums[i] > pivot and nums[j] > pivot, then pi < pj.Return nums after the rearrangement.

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:'A' -> "1"'B' -> "2"...'Z' -> "26"To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message "1*" may represent any of the encoded messages "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", or "19". Decoding "1*" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.Symbol       ValueI             1V             5X             10L             50C             100D             500M             1000For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3.When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.There are no parentheses placed anywhere.We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). For example, "x - x" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "-x + x" is not because it uses negation.We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target. Return the least number of operators used.
Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or false otherwise.

A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.

You are given n tasks labeled from 0 to n - 1 represented by a 2D integer array tasks, where tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei] means that the ith task will be available to process at enqueueTimei and will take processingTimei to finish processing.You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest processing time. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

You do not have to play all the tokens.Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.Initially, you have w capital.

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
Design a text editor with a cursor that can do the following:Add text to where the cursor is.Delete text from where the cursor is (simulating the backspace key).Move the cursor either left or right.When deleting text, only characters to the left of the cursor will be deleted. The cursor will also remain within the actual text and cannot be moved beyond it. More formally, we have that 0 <= cursor.position <= currentText.length always holds.Implement the TextEditor class:TextEditor() Initializes the object with empty text.void addText(string text) Appends text to where the cursor is. The cursor ends to the right of text.int deleteText(int k) Deletes k characters to the left of the cursor. Returns the number of characters actually deleted.string cursorLeft(int k) Moves the cursor to the left k times. Returns the last min(10, len) characters to the left of the cursor, where len is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.string cursorRight(int k) Moves the cursor to the right k times. Returns the last min(10, len) characters to the left of the cursor, where len is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
You are given n BST (binary search tree) root nodes for n separate BSTs stored in an array trees (0-indexed). Each BST in trees has at most 3 nodes, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:Select two distinct indices i and j such that the value stored at one of the leaves of trees[i] is equal to the root value of trees[j].Replace the leaf node in trees[i] with trees[j].Remove trees[j] from trees.Return the root of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing n - 1 operations, or null if it is impossible to create a valid BST.A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:Every node in the node's left subtree has a value strictly less than the node's value.Every node in the node's right subtree has a value strictly greater than the node's value.A leaf is a node that has no children.
You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.
You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.
A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false.
We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like "(1, 3)" or "(2, 0.5)". Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces and ended up with the string s.For example, "(1, 3)" becomes s = "(13)" and "(2, 0.5)" becomes s = "(205)".Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with fewer digits. Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occurring before it, so we never started with numbers like ".1".The final answer list can be returned in any order. All coordinates in the final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)
Given an alphanumeric string s, return the second largest numerical digit that appears in s, or -1 if it does not exist.An alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.Return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.
You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1) given that you can eliminate at most k obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.
You are given a string time in the form of  hh:mm, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by ?).The valid times are those inclusively between 00:00 and 23:59.Return the latest valid time you can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.
A happy string is a string that:consists only of letters of the set ['a', 'b', 'c'].s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.
Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.
You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.Your solution must use only constant extra space.

You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.
You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.(An integer could be positive or negative.)A let expression takes the form "(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)", where let is always the string "let", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.An add expression takes the form "(add e1 e2)" where add is always the string "add", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.A mult expression takes the form "(mult e1 e2)" where mult is always the string "mult", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names "add", "let", and "mult" are protected and will never be used as variable names.Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
There are n people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40.Given a 2D integer array hats, where hats[i] is a list of all hats preferred by the ith person.Return the number of ways that the n people wear different hats to each other.Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string "abe" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
You are an ant tasked with adding n new rooms numbered 0 to n-1 to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a 0-indexed integer array of length n, prevRoom, where prevRoom[i] indicates that you must build room prevRoom[i] before building room i, and these two rooms must be connected directly. Room 0 is already built, so prevRoom[0] = -1. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room 0.You can only build one room at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have already built only if they are connected. You can choose to build any room as long as its previous room is already built.Return the number of different orders you can build all the rooms in. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths m and n respectively. nums1 and nums2 represent the digits of two numbers. You are also given an integer k.Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two numbers. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.Return an array of the k digits representing the answer.
There is a supermarket that is frequented by many customers. The products sold at the supermarket are represented as two parallel integer arrays products and prices, where the ith product has an ID of products[i] and a price of prices[i].When a customer is paying, their bill is represented as two parallel integer arrays product and amount, where the jth product they purchased has an ID of product[j], and amount[j] is how much of the product they bought. Their subtotal is calculated as the sum of each amount[j] * (price of the jth product).The supermarket decided to have a sale. Every nth customer paying for their groceries will be given a percentage discount. The discount amount is given by discount, where they will be given discount percent off their subtotal. More formally, if their subtotal is bill, then they would actually pay bill * ((100 - discount) / 100).Implement the Cashier class:Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices) Initializes the object with n, the discount, and the products and their prices.double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount) Returns the final total of the bill with the discount applied (if any). Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.
Given a binary tree root and a linked list with head as the first node.Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.
There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:dominoes[i] = 'L', if the ith domino has been pushed to the left,dominoes[i] = 'R', if the ith domino has been pushed to the right, anddominoes[i] = '.', if the ith domino has not been pushed.Return a string representing the final state.
Alice has an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree.He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree.Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array guesses where guesses[j] = [uj, vj] indicates Bob guessed uj to be the parent of vj.Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that at least k of his guesses are true.Given the 2D integer arrays edges, guesses and the integer k, return the number of possible nodes that can be the root of Alice's tree. If there is no such tree, return 0.
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0.Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.You are given a string num of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.For example, if the game ended with num = "243801", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = "243803", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.
A k-mirror number is a positive integer without leading zeros that reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 as well as in base-k.For example, 9 is a 2-mirror number. The representation of 9 in base-10 and base-2 are 9 and 1001 respectively, which read the same both forward and backward.On the contrary, 4 is not a 2-mirror number. The representation of 4 in base-2 is 100, which does not read the same both forward and backward.Given the base k and the number n, return the sum of the n smallest k-mirror numbers.
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.Return the sorted array.
There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.
Given two arrays of integers nums and index. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:Initially target array is empty.From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index index[i] the value nums[i] in target array.Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in nums and index.Return the target array.It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.
Strings s1 and s2 are k-similar (for some non-negative integer k) if we can swap the positions of two letters in s1 exactly k times so that the resulting string equals s2.Given two anagrams s1 and s2, return the smallest k for which s1 and s2 are k-similar.
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.Note that:Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more '.' or '+'.For example, in "alice@leetcode.com", "alice" is the local name, and "leetcode.com" is the domain name.If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.If you add a plus '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.For example, "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com".It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.Given an array of strings emails where we send one email to each emails[i], return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.

Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.heighti is the height of the ith building.You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]

Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia CommonsYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_listImplement the Skiplist class:Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.The rules of the game are as follows:Start at the 1st friend.Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.

You should spell all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the "12:00" direction and then by pressing the center button.At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the "12:00" direction, where this character must equal key[i].If the character key[i] has been aligned at the "12:00" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.
You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n.

The testcases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.
Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.Implement the FreqStack class:FreqStack() constructs an empty frequency stack.void push(int val) pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.int pop() removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.
Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters palindrome, replace exactly one character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome and that it is the lexicographically smallest one possible.Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in b. For example, "abcc" is lexicographically smaller than "abcd" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and 'c' is smaller than 'd'.

According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

For example, "11106" can be mapped into:"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
You are given an m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.Perform the following operation until grid becomes empty:Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.Note that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.Return the answer after performing the operations described above.
In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people. The ith person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has.Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.For example, team = [0, 1, 3] represents the people with skills people[0], people[1], and people[3].Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in any order.It is guaranteed an answer exists.
LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.You are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51" and "09:49".Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.Notice that "10:00" - "11:00" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while "22:51" - "23:52" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.
Given two arrays nums1 and nums2.Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, [2,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,5,3] is not).
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.Implement the LRUCache class:LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7Player 1 competes against player 7.Player 2 competes against player 6.Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.
You are given a string s.A split is called good if you can split s into two non-empty strings sleft and sright where their concatenation is equal to s (i.e., sleft + sright = s) and the number of distinct letters in sleft and sright is the same.Return the number of good splits you can make in s.

You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits, spaces ' ', and/or dashes '-'.You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:2 digits: A single block of length 2.3 digits: A single block of length 3.4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.Return the phone number after formatting.
You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.
You are given an integer num. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number.Return the maximum valued number you can get.

If you run out of money, you lose the game.Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.Custom Judge:The judge will test your solution with the following code:int[] nums = [...]; // Input arrayint[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct lengthint k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementationassert k == expectedNums.length;for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];}If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:Search for a node to remove.If the node is found, delete the node.

A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.
You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.For example, if word1 = "abc" and merge = "dv", then after choosing this operation, word1 = "bc" and merge = "dva".If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.For example, if word2 = "abc" and merge = "", then after choosing this operation, word2 = "bc" and merge = "a".Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.

In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.

Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released.The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[0].Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same duration.Return the key of the keypress that had the longest duration.

Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.Implement the LFUCache class:LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.You can feed the pigs according to these steps:Choose some live pigs to feed.For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.Repeat this process until you run out of time.Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.

Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".
You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
Two strings word1 and word2 are considered almost equivalent if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from 'a' to 'z' between word1 and word2 is at most 3.Given two strings word1 and word2, each of length n, return true if word1 and word2 are almost equivalent, or false otherwise.The frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string.
An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence.A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.Given a string containing only digits, return true if it is an additive number or false otherwise.Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.
You are given an n x n grid where we place some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of the cell (i, j).We view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.Return the total area of all three projections.
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.
We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.For example, for n = 3, the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the 3rd row is 0110.Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows.

You are given an m x n integer array grid where grid[i][j] could be:1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.0 representing empty squares we can walk over.-1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.
Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.Return s after reversing it.
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.The score difference between Alice and Bob is (Alice's score - Bob's score). Alice's goal is to maximize the score difference, and Bob's goal is the minimize the score difference.Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally.
The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.
You are given two strings s and t.You are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string t.The score of the string is 0 if no characters are removed from the string t, otherwise:Let left be the minimum index among all removed characters.Let right be the maximum index among all removed characters.Then the score of the string is right - left + 1.Return the minimum possible score to make t a subsequence of s.A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
You are given an array arr which consists of only zeros and ones, divide the array into three non-empty parts such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.If it is possible, return any [i, j] with i + 1 < j, such that:arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i] is the first part,arr[i + 1], arr[i + 2], ..., arr[j - 1] is the second part, andarr[j], arr[j + 1], ..., arr[arr.length - 1] is the third part.All three parts have equal binary values.If it is not possible, return [-1, -1].Note that the entire part is used when considering what binary value it represents. For example, [1,1,0] represents 6 in decimal, not 3. Also, leading zeros are allowed, so [0,1,1] and [1,1] represent the same value.
Alice is a caretaker of n gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.You are given a 0-indexed integer array flowers of size n, where flowers[i] is the number of flowers already planted in the ith garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.
There are two mice and n different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.A point of the cheese with index i (0-indexed) is:reward1[i] if the first mouse eats it.reward2[i] if the second mouse eats it.You are given a positive integer array reward1, a positive integer array reward2, and a non-negative integer k.Return the maximum points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly k types of cheese.

For example, 0 -> 1 is considered to be the same as 1 -> 0. A single node is also considered as a valid path.
There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi.

It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.A node is a leaf if and only if it has zero children.
A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.Notice that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.
Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possiblesubsets(the power set).The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Rearrange the values of nums according to the following rules:Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another".Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.Return the sentence after the replacement.
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of nums with a sum of at least k. If there is no such subarray, return -1.A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
There are n points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The n points on the road are labeled from 1 to n in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point 1 to point n to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.The passengers are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array rides, where rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi] denotes the ith passenger requesting a ride from point starti to point endi who is willing to give a tipi dollar tip.For each passenger i you pick up, you earn endi - starti + tipi dollars. You may only drive at most one passenger at a time.Given n and rides, return the maximum number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.Note: You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.
Given the root of a binary tree, return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree (0-indexed).
SQL SchemaTable: Customer+-------------+---------+| Column Name | Type    |+-------------+---------+| id          | int     || name        | varchar || referee_id  | int     |+-------------+---------+id is the primary key column for this table.Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.Return the result table in any order.The query result format is in the following example.
You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.
Two strings, X and Y, are considered similar if either they are identical or we can make them equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct positions) within the string X.For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?
You have n  tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make using the letters printed on those tiles.

If this is impossible, return -1.
Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.The string "//" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.The string "/*" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of "*/" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string "/*/" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.The first effective comment takes precedence over others.For example, if the string "//" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.Similarly, if the string "/*" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.For example, source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";" will not be a test case.Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so "/*" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. In one operation, you can change any '0' to '1' or vice versa.The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string "010" is alternating, while the string "0100" is not.Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s alternating.
You are given two integers memory1 and memory2 representing the available memory in bits on two memory sticks. There is currently a faulty program running that consumes an increasing amount of memory every second.At the ith second (starting from 1), i bits of memory are allocated to the stick with more available memory (or from the first memory stick if both have the same available memory). If neither stick has at least i bits of available memory, the program crashes.Return an array containing [crashTime, memory1crash, memory2crash], where crashTime is the time (in seconds) when the program crashed and memory1crash and memory2crash are the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively.
Given an array arr of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once.24-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.Return the latest 24-hour time in "HH:MM" format. If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.
You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123  34 8  34". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".Return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.
You are given a 2D integer array grid of size m x n, where each cell contains a positive integer.A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.The product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.Return the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in grid.Note:Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction.Vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.The concatenation of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating their numerals.For example, the concatenation of 15, 49 is 1549.The concatenation value of nums is initially equal to 0. Perform this operation until nums becomes empty:If there exists more than one number in nums, pick the first element and last element in nums respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the concatenation value of nums, then delete the first and last element from nums.If one element exists, add its value to the concatenation value of nums, then delete it.Return the concatenation value of the nums.
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n.The distinct difference array of nums is an array diff of length n such that diff[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] subtracted from the number of distinct elements in the prefix nums[0, ..., i].Return the distinct difference array of nums.Note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j inclusive. Particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.
You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
Given an integer array nums, handle multiple queries of the following types:Update the value of an element in nums.Calculate the sum of the elements of nums between indices left and right inclusive where left <= right.Implement the NumArray class:NumArray(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.void update(int index, int val) Updates the value of nums[index] to be val.int sumRange(int left, int right) Returns the sum of the elements of nums between indices left and right inclusive (i.e. nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]).
Given an array nums of integers, a move consists of choosing any element and decreasing it by 1.An array A is a zigzag array if either:Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] > A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < A[4] > ...OR, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] < A[1] > A[2] < A[3] > A[4] < ...Return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array nums into a zigzag array.

If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.Return the result table in any order.The query result format is in the following example.

If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.
Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.isLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.class Node {public boolean val;public boolean isLeaf;public Node topLeft;public Node topRight;public Node bottomLeft;public Node bottomRight;}We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.Quad-Tree format:You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise only of lowercase English letters.Return the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string.

The first column is the table number and the remaining columns correspond to each food item in alphabetical order. The first row should be a header whose first column is “Table”, followed by the names of the food items. Note that the customer names are not part of the table. Additionally, the rows should be sorted in numerically increasing order.

If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.
Given a text file file.txt that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx.

A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.Successor(x, curOrder):if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:if x is the king return nullelse return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrderFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.In the beginning, curOrder will be ["king"].Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get ["king", "Alice"].Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get ["king", "Alice", "Jack"].Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get ["king", "Alice", "Jack", "Bob"].Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be ["king", "Alice", "Jack", "Bob"].Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.Implement the ThroneInheritance class:ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.void death(string name) Indicates the death of name.

For example, to compress the string "aabccc" we replace "aa" by "a2" and replace "ccc" by "c3". Thus the compressed string becomes "a2bc3".Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.
There is an authentication system that works with authentication tokens. For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire timeToLive seconds after the currentTime. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire timeToLive seconds after the (potentially different) currentTime.Implement the AuthenticationManager class:AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) constructs the AuthenticationManager and sets the timeToLive.generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) generates a new token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds.renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) renews the unexpired token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given tokenId, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t (renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other actions.
Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.A worker can only be chosen once.Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.
Given an integer n, return all the structurally unique BST's (binary search trees), which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n. Return the answer in any order.
Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.
You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.For example, if s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of baseStr = "eed", and "aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.
Given an integer array arr, partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most k. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning. Test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.If box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.Given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.Implement the Trie class:Trie() Initializes the trie object.void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.
