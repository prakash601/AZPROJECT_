A bracket sequence
S is called dense if one of the following is true:
S is empty.
S=(X) where
X is dense.
You are given a bracket sequence
S. What is the minimum number of brackets you must remove to make it dense?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, the number of test cases. The description of the
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N, denoting the length of the bracket sequence.
The second line of each test case contains the bracket sequence
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of brackets you must remove from
S to make it dense.
Constraints
1≤T≤2⋅10
4
1≤N≤3⋅10
5
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: Remove the
2
nd
and
7
th
bracket to obtain ((())), which is dense.
Test case
2: The given bracket sequence is already dense.
Test case
3: Remove the
2
nd
,
4
th
,
7
th
, and
9
th
bracket to obtain ((())), which is dense.
Test case
4: Remove the last
2 brackets to obtain ((())).
