Find the number of sequences with
K elements which satisfy the following conditions:
Each element is an integer between
L and
R inclusive.
The bitwise XOR of all elements is between
A and
B inclusive.
Since the number of sequences satisfying the given conditions can be quite large, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers
L,
R,
A,
B and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid sequences modulo
998,244,353.

###EXPLANATION: In the first testcase, we have to choose one integer in
[26,54]∩[18,34]=[26,34]. So, there are 9 ways.
In the second testcase, we have to choose two integers in
[3,5] with bitwise xor in
[4,7]. There are 4 possible ways:
3⊕4=7
3⊕5=6
4⊕3=7
5⊕3=6.
In the third testcase all
8
3
possible sequences are valid, hence the answer is
512.
