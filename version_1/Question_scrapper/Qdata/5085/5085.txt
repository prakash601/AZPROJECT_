You are given two
N×M integer matrices
A and
B. You are allowed to perform the following operation on
A as many times as you like (possibly, zero):
Pick any square submatrix of
A and flip it about either its main diagonal or its antidiagonal.
For example, suppose you choose the submatrix
[
⎣
⎡
123
456
789
⎦
⎤
.
It can be converted into either
[
⎣
⎡
147
258
369
⎦
⎤
by flipping about the main diagonal, or
[
⎣
⎡
963
852
741
⎦
⎤
by flipping about the antidiagonal.
Is it possible to convert
A to
B by performing this operation several (possibly, zero) times?
Note: For the purposes of this problem, a submatrix of a matrix is the intersection of a contiguous segment of rows with a contiguous segment of columns.
For example, if
A=
⎣
⎡
123
456
789
⎦
⎤
then
[
[
2
],
[
[
56
89
], and
[
[
1
4
] are submatrices of
A, while
[
[
13
79
] is not.
A square submatrix is a submatrix with the same number of rows and columns.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of rows and columns of the matrices, respectively.
The next
N lines describe the matrix
A. The
i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers ― the values
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,…,A
i,M
.
The next
N lines describe the matrix
B. The
i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers ― the values
B
i,1
,B
i,2
,…,B
i,M
.
Output Format
For each test case, print YES if its possible to convert
A to
B, else print NO.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, yeS, YeS will all be treated as identical.
