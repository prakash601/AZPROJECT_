Hossam has
𝑛
trainees. He assigned a number
𝑎
𝑖
for the
𝑖
-th trainee.
A pair of the
𝑖
-th and
𝑗
-th (
𝑖≠𝑗
) trainees is called successful if there is an integer
𝑥
(
𝑥≥2
), such that
𝑥
divides
𝑎
𝑖
, and
𝑥
divides
𝑎
𝑗
.
Hossam wants to know if there is a successful pair of trainees.
Hossam is very tired now, so he asks you for your help!
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤
10
5
), the number of test cases. A description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer number
𝑛
(
2≤𝑛≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
𝑛
integers, the number of each trainee
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
𝑛
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
Print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if there is a successful pair of trainees and "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.

Note
In the first example, the first trainee and the second trainee make up a successful pair:
𝑎
1
=32,
𝑎
2
=48
, you can choose
𝑥=4
.
