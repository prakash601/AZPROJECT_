Given a positive integer N, return its corresponding column title as it would appear in an Excel sheet.
For N =1 we have column A, for 27 we have AA and so on.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 51
Output: AY
Your Task:
Complete the function ExcelColumn() which takes N as input and returns output string.
Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(N))
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
