Chef is organising a contest with
P problems (numbered
1 through
P). Each problem has
S subtasks (numbered
1 through
S).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
Let's denote the score of the
k-th subtask of this problem by
SC
k
and the number of contestants who solved it by
NS
k
.
Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
Calculate the number
n of valid indices
k such that
NS
k
>NS
k+1
.
For problem
i, the difficulty is a pair of integers
(n,i).
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem
a is more difficult than problem
b if the number
n is greater for problem
a than for problem
b, or if
a>b and
n is the same for problems
a and
b.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
P and
S denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
2P lines follow. For each valid
i, the
2i−1-th of these lines contains
S space-separated integers
SC
1
,SC

,…,SC
S
denoting the scores of the
i-th problem's subtasks, and the
2i-th of these lines contains
S space-separated integers
NS

S
denoting the number of contestants who solved the
i-th problem's subtasks.
Output
Print
P lines containing one integer each — the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.
