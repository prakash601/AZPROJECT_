Instead of writing,$a \times (b+c) = a \times b + a \times c$, Joe by mistakenly swapped the $\times$ and + signs on the left hand side. The equation became, $a+(b \times c)= a \times b + a \times c$ ?
Joe somehow knew the value of a, but forgot the values of b and c such that the equation is satisfied. Can you help him find how many ordered pairs $(b,c)$ satisfy the above equation?
If there exists infinite ordered pair, output -1.
Note: $a,b,c$ are integers
Input
Single line containing a single integer $a$
Output
Single line containing one integer, denoting the number of ordered set (b,c)
Constraints
$|a| \leq 10^{18}$
Sample Input
2
Sample Output
4
Explanation
Possible ordered pairs are $(0,1), (1,0), (3,4), (4,3)$
