Given an array
A of length
N, you have to perform
Q queries on it.
There are three different type of queries:
1
L
R - For every
i such that
L≤i≤R and
A
i
>0, replace
A
i
with
A
i
∣
(A
i
−1).
2
L
R - For every
i such that
L≤i≤R and
A
i
>0, replace
A
i
with
A
i
&
(A
i
−1).
3
x - Print
A
x
.
Output the answer to each query of type
3.
Input Format
The first line contains
2 integers,
N and
Q - the number of elements in the array
A and the number of queries, respectively.
The next line contains
N integers -
A
1
,
A
2
,
…,
A
N
, the elements of the array
A.
i-th line of the next
Q lines contains the description of the
i-th query.
Output Format
For each query of type
3, output the value of
A
x
.

Explanation:
Initially,
A=[1,2,3]
Query
1:
A becomes
[1,2
&
(2−1),3
&
(3−1)]=[1,0,2].
Query
2: The value of
A
2
=0.
Query
3: The value of
A
3
=2.
Query
4:
A becomes
[1,0,2
∣
(2−1)]=[1,0,3].
Query
5: The value of
A
1
=1.
Query
6: The value of
A
2
=0.
Query
7: The value of
A
3
=3.
