Shlok and Sachin are good friends. Shlok wanted to test Sachin, so he wrote down a string
S with length
N and one character
X. He wants Sachin to find the number of different substrings of
S which contain the character
X at least once. Sachin is busy with his girlfriend, so he needs you to find the answer.
Two substrings of
S are considered different if their positions in
S are different.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains a string
S with length
N, followed by a space and a character
X.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of substrings of
S that contain
X.
Constraints
