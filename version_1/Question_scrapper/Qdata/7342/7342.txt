You are given two integers
N (N≥2) and
S. You have to construct an array
A containing
N integers such that:
0≤A
i
≤S for each
1≤i≤N
A

&…&A
N
=0, where
& denotes bitwise AND operator.
The maximum element of the array is minimized.
Find the maximum element of the array
A.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
S — the length of array and sum of array elements respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum element of the array
A.

Explanation:
Test case
1: One possible array is
A=[4,3]. Here
4+3=7 and
4&3=0.
Test case
2: One possible array is
[1,2,3]. Here
1+2+3=6 and
1&2&3=0.
Test case
3: One possible array is
[2,4,5,5,5]. Here
2+4+5+5+5=21 and
2&4&5&5&5=0.
