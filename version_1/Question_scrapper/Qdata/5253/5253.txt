This is an interactive problem.
Chef and Cheffa are playing a game. Chef has a sequence of positive integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
; Cheffa should find the values of all elements of this sequence. Cheffa may ask Chef at most
N questions. In each question, Cheffa tells Chef 3 distinct indices
i,
j and
k, and Chef responds with an integer
a
i
⊕a
j
⊕a
k
(
⊕ denotes bitwise XOR).
Also, Chef has an additional condition: for each index
x,
x may appear in all questions in total at most
3 times.
You should play the game for Cheffa; the grader plays for Chef. Find the sequence
a!
Interaction
First, you should read a line containing a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer
N.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing four space-separated integers
1,
i,
j and
k (
1≤i,j,k≤N;
i

=j,
j

=k,
k

=i). Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: the answer to your question or
−1 if the question is invalid or you asked more than
N questions.
To finish solving a test case, you should print a single line containing
N+1 space-separated integers
2,
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer:
1 if your output is correct or
−1 if it is incorrect.
Note that when you receive an answer
−1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
We use
N=4 here for clarity;
N≥8 in real test data. Note that this example would be invalid for subtasks 2 and 3.
