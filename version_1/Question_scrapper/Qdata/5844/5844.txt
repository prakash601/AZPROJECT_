Chef has a tree consisting of
N nodes, rooted at node
1. Every node of this tree can be assigned a binary value
(0 or
1). Initially, every node is assigned 0.
We define AND-value of a set of nodes as the bitwise AND of all the values of the nodes in it.
An edge in the tree is called good, if after removing this edge, the two trees obtained have the same AND-value.
You have to process
Q queries. Each query is one of the following types :
1
u : If node
u is a leaf, change its value to
1, else, change its value to the AND-value of its descendants.
2 : Find the total number of good edges in the tree.
Note: of some node
, are all the nodes in its except
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of nodes in the tree.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges. The
i
th
line contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
.
The next line contains a single integer
Q — the number of queries.
Then,
Q lines follow. Each of these lines describes a query in the format described above.
Output Format
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good edges in the tree.

Explanation:
Query
1: Node
1 is not a leaf node. Thus, we change its value to the AND-value of its descendants. Descendants of node
1 are
{2,3,4,5}. All these nodes have value
0. Thus, the bitwise AND of all values is also
0. Hence, node
1 is assigned
0.
Query
2: Node
3 is assigned
1 since it is a leaf node.
Query
3: Edges between nodes
(1,2),(2,4), and
(2,5) are good edges.
Edge
(1,2): On removing the edge the set of nodes in the two trees are
{1,3} and
{2,4,5}. The AND-values of the respective set of nodes is
0
&
1=0 and
0
&
0
&
0=0, which is equal.
Edge
(2,4): On removing the edge the set of nodes in the two trees are
{4} and
{1,2,3,5}. The AND-values of the respective set of nodes is
0 and
0
&
0
&
1
&
0=0, which is equal.
Edge
(2,5): On removing the edge the set of nodes in the two trees are
{5} and
{1,2,3,4}. The AND-values of the respective set of nodes is
0 and
0
&
0
&
1
&
0=0, which is equal.
Query
4: Node
5 is assigned
1 since it is a leaf node.
Query
5: Edges between nodes
(1,2) and
(2,4) are good edges.
