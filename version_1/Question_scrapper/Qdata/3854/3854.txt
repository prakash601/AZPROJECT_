Chef has an array
A of length
N.
In one operation, Chef can choose any two distinct indices
i,j
(1≤i,j≤N,i

=j) and either change
A
i
to
A
j
or change
A
j
to
A
i
.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case consists of an integer
N - denoting the size of array
A.
Second line of each test case consists of
N space-separated integers
,
,…,
N
- denoting the array
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements equal.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: You can make all the elements equal in
2 operations. In the first operation, you can choose indices
1,2 and convert
A
1
to
A
2
. So the array becomes
[2,2,3]. Now you can choose indices
1,3 and convert
A
3
to
A
1
, so the final array becomes
[2,2,2].
Test Case
2: Since all the elements are already equal there is no need to perform any operation.
Test Case
3: You can make all the elements equal in
2 operations. In the first operation, you can choose indices
1,3 and convert
A
1
to
A
3
. So the array becomes
[1,2,1,1]. Now you can choose indices
1,2 and convert
A
2
to
A
1
, so the final array becomes
[1,1,1,1].
Test Case
4: You can make all the elements equal in
1 operation. You can pick indices
2,3 and convert
A
3
to
A
2
after which the array becomes
[1,1,1].
