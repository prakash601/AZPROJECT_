Tracy gives Charlie a Directed Acyclic Graph with
N vertices. Among these
N vertices,
K vertices are sources, and
L vertices are sinks.
Find out the maximum number of edges this graph can have.
Note:
A source is a vertex with no incoming edge.
A sink is a vertex with no outgoing edge.
A vertex can be both, a source, and a sink.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, three space-separated integers
N,K, and
L - the number of vertices, the number of sources and the number of sinks respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the maximum number of edges this graph can have.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Assume that the vertices are numbered
1,2, and
3. Let
1 be a source and
3 be a sink. The edges of a possible DAG are
1→2,2→3, and
1→3.
The number of edges in this graph are
3. It can be shown that this is the maximum number of edges possible under given constraints.
Test case
2: Assume that the vertices are numbered
1,2,3,4, and
5. Let
1,2, and
3 be sources and
3,4, and
5 be sinks. The edges of a possible DAG are
1→4,2→4,1→5 and
2→5.
The number of edges in this graph are
4. It can be shown that this is the maximum number of edges possible under given constraints.
