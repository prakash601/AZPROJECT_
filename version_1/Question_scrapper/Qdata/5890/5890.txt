Chef got interested in bits and wanted to learn about them, so his friend Pintu gave him a special function
F(X,Y,Z)=(X∧Z)⋅(Y∧Z), where
∧ is the bitwise AND operator and
X,Y,Z are non-negative integers.
Pintu wants Chef to maximise the function
F(X,Y,Z) for given
X and
Y by choosing an appropriate
Z. However, to make it interesting, Pintu also gave Chef limits
L and
R for
Z. In other words, he wants Chef to find a non-negative integer
Z (
L≤Z≤R) such that
F(X,Y,Z)=max
L≤k≤R
(F(X,Y,k)). If there is more than one such value of
Z, he should find the smallest one in the range
[L,R].
Since Chef is busy cooking in the kitchen, he needs you to help him solve this problem.
Note:
X,
Y,
L and
R are chosen in such a way that
max
L≤k≤R
(F(X,Y,k)) never exceeds

62
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
X,
Y,
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest value of
Z in the given range that maximises
F.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Here,
Z=15 maximises the function, since
F(7,12,15)=84. It is impossible to reach
F>84 with any
Z in the given range.
Example case 2: The smallest
Z which maximises
F is
Z=7, and the value of
F for this
Z is
28.
