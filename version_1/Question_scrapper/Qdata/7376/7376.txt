The droid R2-D2 is travelling in space with a special mission. In space, there are
N planets (numbered
1 through
N) and
M bidirectional space highways. Each space highway connects two planets and in order to use it, R2-D2 needs to have a sufficiently high status level.
The droid’s mission consists of
Q stages. In each stage, there are two planets
x and
y such that the droid should start the stage at planet
x with some initial status level
L (
L≥0) and travel to planet
y. For each valid
i, when R2-D2 is at planet
i (including the initial planet
x), he may increase his status level by
A
i
; it is not allowed to increase the status level multiple times on the same planet in the same stage. Find the minimum value of
L such that it is possible for R2-D2 to reach planet
y or determine that it is impossible to reach planet
y for any
L.
Note that the level R2-D2 has at the end of each stage is not carried over to the next stages (he may start the next stage with a lower initial status level).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,…,A
N
.
Each of the following
M lines contains three space separated integers
U,
V and
W denoting that there is a space highway between planets
U and
V and R2-D2 may use this highway only if his status level is at least
W.
The next line contains a single integer
Q.
The following
Q lines describe stages. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
y.
Output
For each stage, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum status level required to complete the stage, or
−1 if it is impossible to complete this stage.
