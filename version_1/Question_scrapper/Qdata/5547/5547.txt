You are given two strings
S and
R. You may reorder the characters in the string
R in any way; let's denote the resulting string by
R
r
. This reordered string is valid if it contains all substrings of
S, i.e. for each substring
s of
S (including
S itself),
R
r
contains
s as a substring.
Find the lexicographically smallest valid reordered string or determine that there is no such valid string.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string
S.
The second line contains a single string
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string — the lexicographically smallest valid reordered string, or "Impossible" if there is no such string.
