You are given an array of integers
a1,a2,…,an
.
You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose any index
i
and set
ai
to any integer (positive, negative or
0
).
What is the minimum number of operations needed to turn
a
into an arithmetic progression? The array
a
is an arithmetic progression if
ai+1−ai=ai−ai−1
for any
2≤i≤n−1
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤105
).
Output
Print a single integer: the minimum number of operations needed to turn
a
into an arithmetic progression.

Note
In the first test, you can get the array
a=[11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3]
by performing
6
operations:
Set
a3
to
9
: the array becomes
[3,2,9,8,6,9,5,4,1]
;
Set
a2
to
10
: the array becomes
[3,10,9,8,6,9,5,4,1]
;
Set
a6
to
6
: the array becomes
[3,10,9,8,6,6,5,4,1]
;
Set
a9
to
3
: the array becomes
[3,10,9,8,6,6,5,4,3]
;
Set
a5
to
7
: the array becomes
[3,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3]
;
Set
a1
to
11
: the array becomes
[11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3]
.
a
is an arithmetic progression: in fact,
ai+1−ai=ai−ai−1=−1
for any
2≤i≤n−1
.
There is no sequence of less than
6
operations that makes
a
an arithmetic progression.
In the second test, you can get the array
a=[−1,2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38]
by performing
10
operations.
In the third test, you can get the array
a=[100000,80000,60000,40000,20000,0,−20000,−40000,−60000,−80000]
by performing
7
operations.
