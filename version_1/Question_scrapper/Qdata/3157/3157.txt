Here, we'll learn the delete keyword that's used to clear the dynamically allocated memory in CPP.
Given a dynamic array A of size N. The task is to find the sum of array elements.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 
15
1
Explanation:
Sum of array elements is 15 
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5). The first
element is 1.
 
Just comment the line that is deallocating the array. Driver code will output the sum of array elements and in next line prints the first array element(A[0]).
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= 105
