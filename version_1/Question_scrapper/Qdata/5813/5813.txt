Chef wants to gift his girlfriend a necklace made of beads. The beads can be made of either Stone, Glass, Quartz, Ruby or Diamond (he need not use all five types of beads) .
Each bead has a value associated with its beauty as follows
-2 for Stone
-1 for Glass
0 for Quartz
1 for Ruby
2 for Diamond
Each bead also has a cost given by S, G, Q, R and D for the respective bead.
There are q queries for you. In each query chef wants to know the minimum cost for creating a necklace using exactly X beads and overall beauty of Y.
Overall beauty Y is defined as the sum of beauty of each bead used in the necklace.
Since you’re a great programmer, he wants you to answer each query as soon as possible.
###Input
First line contains 5 space separated integers S, G, Q, R, D, the respective cost of beads. Next line contains q the number of queries next q lines had two integers X and Y , the number of beads to be used and the overall beauty
###Output
for each query output the answer in a new line output the minimum cost if it exists otherwise print -1
###Constrains
1≤q≤5∗10
5
0≤S,G,Q,R,D≤10
6
0≤X≤100
−200≤Y≤200
###Subtasks
10 points :
0≤X≤2
20 points :
q=1
70 points : original constrains
###Sample Input
1 2 2 3 4
3
2 0
1 -2
3 6
###Sample Output
4
1
12
###Explanation
in the first query we can take (stone,diamond), (glass,ruby), (quarts,quarts) but the minimum cost would be if we took quarts and quarts which is 4
second query there is only one way that is to take one stone and the cost is 1
third query also there is only one way to take three diamonds and the cost is 12
