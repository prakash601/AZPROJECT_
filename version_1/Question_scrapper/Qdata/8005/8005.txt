You are given a string
s
with length
n−1
whose characters are either
<
or
>
.
Count the permutations
p1,p2,…,pn
of
1,2,…,n
such that, for all
i=1,2,…,n−1
, if
si
is
<
then
pi<pi+1
and if
si
is
>
then
pi>pi+1
.
Since this number can be very large, compute its logarithm in base
2
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100000
).
The second line contains a string
s
of length
n−1
; each character of
s
is either
<
or
>
.
Output
Print the logarithm in base
2
of the number of permutations satisfying the constraints described in the statement.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10−6
. Formally, let your answer be
x
and let the correct answer be
y
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|x−y|
max(1,|y|)
≤10−6
.

Note
In the first sample, there is only one valid permutation, that is
[2,1]
. Since
log2(1)=0
, the correct output is
0
.
In the second sample, there are
2
valid permutations, that are
[3,1,2]
and
[2,1,3]
. Since
log2(2)=1
, the correct output is
1
.
In the third sample, there are
4
valid permutations, that are
[1,5,4,3,2]
,
[2,5,4,3,1]
,
[3,5,4,2,1]
,
[4,5,3,2,1]
. Since
log2(4)=2
, the correct output is
2
.
In the fourth sample, there are
909
valid permutations. Notice that
log2(909)=9.828136484194…
