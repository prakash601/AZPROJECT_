Given a string consisting of lowercase english alphabets, reverse only the vowels present in it and print the resulting string.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: geeksforgeeks
Explanation: The vowels are: e, e, o, e, e
Reverse of these is also e, e, o, e, e.

Example 2:

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by reversing only the vowels present in S.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
