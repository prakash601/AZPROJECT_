JJ has an integer
K. JJ also has an array
A of length
N where
(0≤A
i
<2
K
). He can perform the following operations on
A any number of times (possibly zero):
Select
i and
x such that
1≤i≤N and
0≤x<2
K
and for each
1≤j≤i, set
A
j
:=A
j
&x.
Select
i and
x such that
1≤i≤N and
0≤x<2
K
and for each
i≤j≤N, set
A
j
:=A
j
∣x.
Here,
& denotes the bitwise AND operation and
∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Determine the number of different arrays JJ can obtain by applying the above operations zero or more times. Since the answer can be large, output the answer modulo
998244353.
Two arrays
P and
Q are said to be different if there exists any index
i such that
P

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the size of the array
A and the parameter
K mentioned in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1:
[0,0],
[0,1],
[1,0] and
[1,1] are the arrays which can be obtained from
A=[1,0].
Test case
2:
[0,0],
[0,1], and
[1,1] are the arrays which can be obtained from
A=[0,1]. Note that we cannot obtain
[1,0].
