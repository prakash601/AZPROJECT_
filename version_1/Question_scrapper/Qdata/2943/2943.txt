Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict of length n, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Each dictionary word can be used more than once. Return all such possible sentences.
Follow examples for better understanding.
Example 1:
Input: s = "catsanddog", n = 5 
dict = {"cats", "cat", "and", "sand", "dog"}
Output: (cats and dog)(cat sand dog)
Explanation: All the words in the given 
sentences are present in the dictionary.
Example 2:
Input: s = "catsandog", n = 5
dict = {"cats", "cat", "and", "sand", "dog"}
 Empty
 There is no possible breaking 
of the string s where all the words are present 
in dict.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function wordBreak() which takes n, dict and s as input parameters and returns a list of possible sentences. If no sentence is possible it returns an empty list.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N2*n) where N = |s|
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 20
1 ≤ dict[i] ≤ 15
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500
