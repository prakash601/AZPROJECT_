You are given an array
A of size
N. You can perform the following operation on the array:
Choose an index
i
(1≤i≤N);
Choose a set of indices
S of size
K,
(1≤K≤N,1≤S
j
≤N);

, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Let
B denote the array obtained after sorting the array
A. Your task is to convert the array
A to array
B using at most
⌈
2
3⋅N
⌉ operations.
You also need to print the operations performed to convert the array
A to array
B. If there are multiple ways to convert the array, print any.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one possible solution.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers, the elements of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, print
(2⋅M+1) lines:
On the first line, print
M, the number of operations required to convert the array
A to array
B, where
(0≤M≤⌈
2
3⋅N
⌉).
Describe each operation in two lines:
In the first line, print two space-separated integers
i and
K
(1≤i,K≤N), the chosen index and the number of elements in the set
S.
In the second line, print
K space-separated integers, the elements of set
S. Note that all elements of the set
S should be distinct.
Constraints
1≤T≤3000
2≤N≤1000
1≤A
i
≤N
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
6000.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The array
B=[1,2,2,2]. We can convert the array
A to array
B using
3 operations in the following way:
Operation
1: Choose
i=4 and
S={1,2,3,4}. Thus, we set
A
4
=A
1
⊕A
2
⊕A
3
⊕A
4
=2⊕2⊕1⊕2=3. Thus, the array becomes
[2,2,2,3].
Operation
2: Choose
i=1 and
S={1,4}. Thus, we set
A
1
=A
1
⊕A
4
=2⊕3=1. Thus, the array becomes
[1,2,2,3].
Operation
3: Choose
i=4 and
S={1,4}. Thus, we set
A
4
=A
1
⊕A
4
=1⊕3=2. Thus, the array becomes
[1,2,2,2].
Note that there might be other ways to convert the array as well.
Test case
2: The array
B=[1,3,4,5,5]. We can convert the array
A to array
B using
2 operations in the following way:
Operation
1: Choose
i=4 and
S={1,4}. Thus, we set
A
4
=A
1
⊕A
4
=1⊕4=5. Thus, the array becomes
[1,3,5,5,5].
Operation
2: Choose
i=3 and
S={1,3,4,5}. Thus, we set
A
3
=A
1
⊕A
3
⊕A
4
⊕A
5
=1⊕5⊕5⊕5=4. Thus, the array becomes
[1,3,4,5,5].
Note that there might be other ways to convert the array as well.
Test case
3: The array
B=[2,4,5,5,6,6]. Since the array is already equal to array
B, we require
0 operations.
