Explanation:
Test case 1: There are
20 students in the class and Chef has
14 chairs already. Therefore Chef must buy
6 more chairs.
Test case 2: There are
41 students in the class and Chef already has exactly
41 chairs. Therefore Chef does not need to buy any more chairs.
Test case 3: There are
35 students in the class and Chef has no chairs initially. Therefore Chef must buy
35 chairs.
