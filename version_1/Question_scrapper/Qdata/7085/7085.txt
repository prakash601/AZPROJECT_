Dream abstracts the fabric of spacetime as a directed rooted tree (arborescence) with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). Node
1 is the root and for each
i (
1≤i≤N−1), the parent of node
i+1 is
f
i
. All edges of this tree are directed away from the root.
Then, Dream employs a magical superpower and adds
M directed edges to this tree in such a way that the resulting directed graph remains acyclic (a DAG).
Let's call a node of this DAG an event and further call a simple path on this DAG an era. Dream considers a pair of events
(i,j) to be plausible if there is an era whose first event is
i and last event is
j. Note that
i<j does not have to hold for a plausible pair.
Dream now wants you to answer
Q queries. In each query, he gives you two positive integers
l and
r, where
l≤r, and he wishes to know the number of plausible pairs of events
(i,j) such that
l≤i<j≤r.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
f

,f

,…,f
N−1
.
M lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v describing an additional edge from node
u to node
v.
The following line contains a single integer
Q.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
l and
r describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of plausible pairs
(i,j) such that
l≤i<j≤r.
