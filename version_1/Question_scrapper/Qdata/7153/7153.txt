A polygon
T is said to be inside a polygon
S if all points that lie strictly inside
T (not on the perimeter of
T) also lie strictly inside
S.
A multiset of polygons
{Q
1
,Q
2
,…,Q
r
} is said to form a chain if there is a permutation
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
r
of the integers
1 through
r such that for each
i (
1≤i<r),
Q
p
i
is inside
Q
p
i+1
.
You are given
N convex polygons
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. Every
10
−100
seconds, you may choose one of the polygons and translate it by upto
10
−100
either along the
x-axis or along the
y-axis.
Find the minimum amount of time necessary to make all
N polygons form a chain or decide that it is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N. The descriptions of
N polygons follow.
For each polygon:
The first line contains a single integer
M denoting the number of its vertices.
The following
M lines describe the vertices in counterclockwise order. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
y denoting the coordinates of one vertex.
Output
If it is impossible to make the polygons form a chain, print a single line containing the integer
−1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing one real number ― the minimum amount of time. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.
Constraints
2≤N≤20
the sum of
M over all polygons does not exceed
100
∣x∣,∣y∣≤100
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points):
N=2 and both polygons are axis-aligned rectangles
Subtask #2 (20 points):
N=2
Subtask #3 (20 points): all polygons are axis-aligned rectangles
Subtask #4 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: Both
P
1
and
P
2
are squares. If we move
P
2
by
1 unit in the
x-direction and by
2 units in the
y-direction, the vertices of
P
1
become the midpoints of edges of
P
2
.
