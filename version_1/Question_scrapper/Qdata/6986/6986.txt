The city of Chefland has a metro network of
n stations where there are metro tunnels between certain pairs of stations. The budget was tight during construction, so the
n stations are connected using only
n−1 tunnels. Every station is still reachable from every other station.
Being initially constructed with such a tight budget, it is no surprise that they have fallen into disrepair over time. Chef, the mayor of Chefland, has secured
k dollars for renovating the metro stations. Each metro station is different and the
i
th
station requires
a
i
dollars to renovate. But, if one or more stations directly connected to the
i
th
station are also being renovated, it is possible to share certain resources between the stations and the cost of renovating the
i
th
station drops to
b
i
dollars.
Help Chef figure out what is the maximum number of stations he can renovate using
k dollars.
