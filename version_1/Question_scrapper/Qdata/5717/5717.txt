You are given an array
A of
N non-negative integers, where
N is odd. Find the minimum non-negative integer
x that satisfies the equation
(A
1
+x)⊕(A
2
+x)⊕⋯⊕(A
N
+x)=0
where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. If no such
x exists, print
−1.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format
First line of the input contains a single integer
T, the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated non-negative integers

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer. If there does not exist any non-negative integer
x that satisfies the given equation, print
−1. Otherwise, print the minimum value of
x that satisfies the given equation.

Explanation:
Test case 1:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer
x such that
(2+x)⊕(4+x)⊕(5+x)=0 Let
f(x)=(2+x)⊕(4+x)⊕(5+x).
For
x=0, we have
f(0)=(2+0)⊕(4+0)⊕(5+0)=2⊕4⊕5=3
For
x=1, we have
f(1)=(2+1)⊕(4+1)⊕(5+1)=3⊕5⊕6=0
Therefore,
x=1 is the minimum non-negative integer that satisfies the given equation.
Test case 2:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer
x such that
(0+x)⊕(0+x)⊕(0+x)=0 i.e.
x⊕x⊕x=0. But since
0⊕0⊕0=0, it follows that
x=0 is the minimum non-negative integer that satisfies the given equation.
Test case 3:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer
x such that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(1+x)=0 But
a⊕a=0 and
0⊕a=a for any non-negative integer
a. It follows that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(1+x)=0⊕(1+x)=1+x
This implies that
x satisfies the given equation if and only if it satisfies
1+x=0 if and only if
x=−1. But
−1 is a negative integer and therefore, there does not exist any
x that satisfies the given equation.
Test case 4:
We have to find minimum non-negative integer
x such that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(2+x)=0 It follows that
(1+x)⊕(1+x)⊕(2+x)=0⊕(2+x)=2+x
This implies that
x satisfies the given equation if and only if it satisfies
2+x=0, which can only happen if
x=−2. But
−2 is a negative integer and therefore, there does not exist any non-negative
x that satisfies the given equation, hence we output
−1.
