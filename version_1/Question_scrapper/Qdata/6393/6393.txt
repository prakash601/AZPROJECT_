For an array
A of
N integers, define
An array
P of length
N, where
P
i
is the number of distinct elements in the subarray
A[1:i] of
A.
An array
S of length
N, where
S
i
is the number of distinct elements in the subarray
A[i:N] of
A.
You are given arrays
P and
S. Determine whether there exists an array
A corresponding to the given
P and
S arrays.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
P

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line: if there does not exist any array
A producing such
P and
S arrays, then output NO, otherwise output YES
You can output each letter in any case.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
P=[1,2,3] and
S=[3,2,1].
Consider
A=[1,2,3].
The number of distinct elements in the
1st prefix
[1] is
1.
The number of distinct elements in the
2nd prefix
[1,2] is
2.
The number of distinct elements in the
3rd prefix
[1,2,3] is
3.
and
The number of distinct elements in the
1st suffix
[1,2,3] is
3.
The number of distinct elements in the
2nd suffix
[2,3] is
2.
The number of distinct elements in the
3rd suffix
[3] is
1.
Clearly
A produces the given
P and
S.
Test case
2: We have
P=[2,2,3,3] ,
S=[3,2,2,1].
It can be proven that there does not exist any array
A which produces the given
P and
S.
Test case
3: We have
P=[1,1],
S=[1,1].
Consider
A=[7,7].
The number of distinct elements in the
1st prefix
[7] is
1.
The number of distinct elements in the
2nd prefix
[7,7] is
1.
and
The number of distinct elements in the
1st suffix
[7,7] is
1.
The number of distinct elements in the
2nd suffix
[7] is
1.
Clearly
A produces the given
P and
S.
Test case
4:
P=[1,2,1] ,
S=[2,2,1].
It can be proven that there does not exist any array
A which produces the given
P and
S.
