Two players are playing a game. They are given an array
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
as well as an array
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
.
The game consists of
M rounds. Players are participating in rounds alternatively. During the
i-th round (for
i from
1 to
M) the corresponding player (first player, if
i is odd, and second if
i is even) has to do exactly one of the following:
remove all elements from the array
A that are divisible by
B
i
,
remove all elements from the array
A that are not divisible by
B
i
.
The first player wants to minimize the sum of the remaining elements in the array
A after all
M rounds, and the second wants to maximize it. Find the sum of the remaining elements in the array
A after all
M rounds if both players are playing optimally.
Input Format
The first line contains two integers
N,
M
− the length of the array
A and the number of rounds in the game.
The second line contains
N integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
− the elements of the array
A.
The third line contains
M integers
B

M
− the elements of the array
B.
Output Format
Output a single integer
− the sum of the remaining elements of the array
A after all
M rounds if both players are playing optimally.

Explanation:
In the sample, one possible flow of the game is the following:
Round
1: first player removes from
A all elements divisible by
2.
A becomes
(5,7).
Round
2: second player removes from
A all elements divisible by
5.
A becomes
(7). If he had removed from
A all elements not divisible by
5,
A would become
(5), which has a smaller sum of elements and therefore is not desirable for the second player.
