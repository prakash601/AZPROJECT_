You are given a weighed undirected connected graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges.
You should answer
q
queries, the
i
-th query is to find the shortest distance between vertices
ui
and
vi
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m (1≤n,m≤105,m−n≤20)
— the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Next
m
lines contain the edges: the
i
-th edge is a triple of integers
vi,ui,di (1≤ui,vi≤n,1≤di≤109,ui≠vi)
. This triple means that there is an edge between vertices
ui
and
vi
of weight
di
. It is guaranteed that graph contains no self-loops and multiple edges.
The next line contains a single integer
q (1≤q≤105)
— the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
ui
and
vi (1≤ui,vi≤n)
— descriptions of the queries.
Pay attention to the restriction
m−n ≤ 20
.
Output
Print
q
lines.
The
i
-th line should contain the answer to the
i
-th query — the shortest distance between vertices
ui
and
vi
.
