Marmot found a row with n pillars. The i-th pillar has the height of hi meters. Starting from one pillar i1, Marmot wants to jump on the pillars i2, ..., ik. (1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤ n). From a pillar i Marmot can jump on a pillar j only if i < j and |hi - hj| ≥ d, where |x| is the absolute value of the number x.
Now Marmot is asking you find out a jump sequence with maximal length and print it.
Input
The first line contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ d ≤ 109).
The second line contains n numbers h1, h2, ..., hn (1 ≤ hi ≤ 1015).
Output
The first line should contain one integer k, the maximal length of a jump sequence.
The second line should contain k integers i1, i2, ..., ik (1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤ n), representing the pillars' indices from the maximal length jump sequence.
If there is more than one maximal length jump sequence, print any.

Note
In the first example Marmot chooses the pillars 1, 2, 3, 5 with the heights 1, 3, 6, 4. Another jump sequence of length 4 is 1, 2, 4, 5.
