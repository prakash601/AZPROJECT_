Chef has two integers
X and
Y. Chef wants to perform some operations to make both
X and
Y zero simultaneously. In one operation, Chef can either:
set
X:=2⋅X
or set
Y:=2⋅Y
or set
X:=X−1 and
Y:=Y−1
Chef is a little busy with preparing the contest. Help him find the minimum number of operations required to make both
X and
Y equal to
0 simultaneously. If it is impossible to do so after any number of operations, print
−1.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers
X and
Y.
Output Format
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to make
X and
Y zero simultaneously. If it is impossible to do so after any number of operations, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Let
(x,y) denote the values of
X and
Y respectively.
Test case 1: Three operations are required:
(1,2)
X:=X⋅2
(2,2)
X:=X−1
Y:=Y−1
(1,1)
X:=X−1
Y:=Y−1
(0,0)
It can be proven that it is impossible in fewer operations.
