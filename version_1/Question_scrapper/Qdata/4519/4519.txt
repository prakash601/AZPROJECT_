Chef has two positive integers
X and
Y. Now Chef wants to perform some number of operations (possibly zero) on them. In each operation, Chef can choose either
X or
Y and increment it by
1. Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that there is a positive integer strictly greater than
1 which divides both
X and
Y (In other words, the greatest common divisor of
X and
Y should be greater than
1).
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
X and
Y.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The greatest common divisor of
4 and
16 is
4 which is already greater than
1, so Chef will not perform any operations.
Test Case 2: Chef will perform one operation and add
1 to
55. Now the greatest common divisor of
4 and
56 is
4 which is greater than
1.
