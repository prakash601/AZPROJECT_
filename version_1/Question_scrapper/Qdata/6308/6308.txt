You are given an array
A of size
N.
A partitioning of the array
A is the splitting of
A into one or more non-empty contiguous subarrays such that each element of
A belongs to exactly one of these subarrays.
Find the number of ways to partition
A such that the parity of the sum of elements within the subarrays is alternating. In other words, if
S
i
denotes the sum of the elements in the
i-th subarray, then either
S
1
is odd,
S
2
is even,
S
3
is odd and so on.
or
S
1
is even,
S
2
is odd,
S
3
is even and so on.
For example if
A=[1,2,3,3,5]. One way to partition
A is
[1,2][3,3][5]. Another way to partition
A is
[1][2][3][3,5]. Note that there exists more ways to partition this array.
Since the answer may be large, output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the answer modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case 1: The array can be partitioned as follows
[1][2][3]
[1,2,3]
Test case 2: The array can be partitioned as follows
[4,4,4,4]
