You are given an array
A of size
N such that
A
i
=0 initially, for all
1≤i≤N.
You have
M enemies and each enemy will blast one bomb on an index. The
i
th
enemy
(1≤i≤M) will place their bomb at index
X
i
, and the bomb will have a range of
Y
i
.
This means that, due to the
i
th
bomb, all indices in the range
[X
i
−Y
i
,X
i
+Y
i
] might be affected:
For indices
j,
(max(1,X
i
−Y
i
)≤j<X
i
), the value at the
j
th
index decreases by
(X
i
−j)⋅(X
i
−j+1).
For indices
k,
(X
i
<k≤min(N,X
i
+Y
i
)), the value at the
k
th
index increases by
(k−X
i
)⋅(k−X
i
+1).
The value at the
X
i
th
index remains as it is.
Find the resultant array after all bombs blast.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N,M - the size of the array and the total number of bomb blasts, respectively.
The next
M lines of each test case contains two space-separated integers
X
i
,Y
i
- index at which the bomb will blast and the range of the bomb, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print
N space-separated integers, denoting the resultant array after all bombs blast.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The initial array is
[0,0,0,0,0]. There are two bombs
(3,2) and
(1,4):
The first bomb is at index
3 with range
2. Thus, after the blast, the array becomes
[−(3−1)⋅(3−1+1),−(3−2)⋅(3−2+1),0,(4−3)⋅(4−3+1),(5−3)⋅(5−3+1)]=[−6,−2,0,2,6].
The second bomb is at index
1 with range
4. Thus, after the blast, the array becomes
[−6,−2+(2−1)⋅(2−1+1),0+(3−1)⋅(3−1+1),2+(4−1)⋅(4−1+1),6+(5−1)⋅(5−1+1)]=[−6,0,6,14,26].
Thus, the resultant array after all blasts would be
[−6,0,6,14,26].
