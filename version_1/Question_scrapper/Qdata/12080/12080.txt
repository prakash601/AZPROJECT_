Consider a tree (that is, an undirected connected graph without loops)
T1
and a tree
T2
. Let's define their cartesian product
T1×T2
in a following way.
Let
V
be the set of vertices in
T1
and
U
be the set of vertices in
T2
.
Then the set of vertices of graph
T1×T2
is
V×U
, that is, a set of ordered pairs of vertices, where the first vertex in pair is from
V
and the second — from
U
.
Let's draw the following edges:
Between
(v,u1)
and
(v,u2)
there is an undirected edge, if
u1
and
u2
are adjacent in
U
.
Similarly, between
(v1,u)
and
(v2,u)
there is an undirected edge, if
v1
and
v2
are adjacent in
V
.
Please see the notes section for the pictures of products of trees in the sample tests.
Let's examine the graph
T1×T2
. How much cycles (not necessarily simple) of length
k
it contains? Since this number can be very large, print it modulo
998244353
.
The sequence of vertices
w1
,
w2
, ...,
wk
, where
wi∈V×U
called cycle, if any neighboring vertices are adjacent and
w1
is adjacent to
wk
. Cycles that differ only by the cyclic shift or direction of traversal are still considered different.
Input
First line of input contains three integers —
n1
,
n2
and
k
(
2≤n1,n2≤4000
,
2≤k≤75
) — number of vertices in the first tree, number of vertices in the second tree and the cycle length respectively.
Then follow
n1−1
lines describing the first tree. Each of this lines contains two integers —
vi,ui
(
1≤vi,ui≤n1
), which define edges of the first tree.
Then follow
n2−1
lines, which describe the second tree in the same format.
It is guaranteed, that given graphs are trees.
Output
Print one integer — number of cycles modulo
998244353
.

Note
The following three pictures illustrate graph, which are products of the trees from sample tests.
In the first example, the list of cycles of length
2
is as follows:
«AB», «BA»
«BC», «CB»
«AD», «DA»
«CD», «DC»
