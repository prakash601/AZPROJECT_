Explanation:
Test case
1: The final price of ordering online would be
500−(10% of
500)=450 which is less than the price of dining. Thus, Chef should order online.
Test case
2: The final price of ordering online would be
500−(10% of
500)=450 which is not less than
400. Thus, Chef should choose dining option.
Test case
3: Even after the
10% discount, cost of ordering online is higher. Thus, Chef should choose dining option.
Test case

10% discount, cost of ordering online is
90. The costs of ordering online and dining at restaurant are same. Thus, Chef can choose any option.
