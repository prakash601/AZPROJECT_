Chef has an array
A of length
N.
In one operation, Chef can do the following:
Select any non-empty subsequence
S={S
1
,S
2
,S
3
,…S
k
} of
A (where the
S
i
are the indices of the array representing the chosen subsequence)
Then, choose one index from this subsequence, say
S
j
Finally, either add
A
S
j
to every element of the subsequence, or subtract
A
S
j
from every element of the subsequence. Formally, Chef must choose to do exactly one of:
Set
A
S
i
=A
S
i
+A
S
j
for every
1≤i≤k, or
Set
A
S
i
=A
S
i
−A
S
j
for every
1≤i≤k
Chef's task is to make all the elements of the array equal within
100 operations.
Note that after each operation,
−10
18
≤A
i
≤10
18
should hold for every element of the array.
See output details for instructions regarding the output format.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
N denoting the length of the array
A.
The second line of input contains
N space-separated integers denoting the array
A.
Output Format
On the first line output the number of operations you are going to perform, say
k.
Then, for each
i=1,2,…,k, the
i-th operation must be printed on three lines as follows:
On a new line, print
x, the length of the chosen subsequence in this operation.
On the next line, print
x distinct indices denoting the chosen subsequence
S.
On the next line, print
+ S
j
if you want to add
A
S
j
to all the elements of the subsequence
S
− S
j
if you want to subtract
A
S
j
from all the elements of the subsequence
S.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The operations change the array as follows:
Initial array =
{4,1,2,3}
Array after first operation =
{4,2,2,4}
Array after second operation =
{4,4,4,4}.
Test case
2: The operations change the array as follows:
Initial array =
{1,2,3}
Array after first operation =
{1,2,0}
Array after second operation =
{2,2,1}.
Array after third operation =
{2,2,2}.
