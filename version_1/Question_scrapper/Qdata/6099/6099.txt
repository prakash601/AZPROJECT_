Concatenation of two integers is obtained as follows: First, convert both integers to strings. Then concatenate both strings into one and convert this concatenated string back to integer.
For example, concatenation of
6 and
7 is
CONC(6,7)=67, concatenation of
123 and
45 is
CONC(123,45)=12345.
You are given an array
A consisting of
N integers. You are also given two integers
L and
R. Find the number of pairs (
i,
j) such that
1≤i,j≤N and
L≤CONC(A
i
,A
j
)≤R
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then

The first line of each test case contains three integers
N,L,R.
The second line of each test case line contains
N integers

Explanation:
Test case 1:
(i=1,j=1):
CONC(A
1
,A
1
)=22 and
10≤22≤52.
(i=1,j=2):
CONC(A
1
,A
2
)=25 and
10≤25≤52.
(i=2,j=1):
CONC(A
2
,A
1
)=52 and
10≤52≤52.
(i=2,j=2):
CONC(A
2
,A
2
)=55 and
10≤55 but
55≰52.
So there are three suitable pairs.
Test case 2: There is no suitable pair.
Test case 3: The suitable pairs are
(2,1) and
(1,2).
