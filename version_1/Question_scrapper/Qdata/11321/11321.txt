You are given a sequence
a1,a2,…,an
consisting of
n
integers.
You can choose any non-negative integer
D
(i.e.
D≥0
), and for each
ai
you can:
add
D
(only once), i. e. perform
ai:=ai+D
, or
subtract
D
(only once), i. e. perform
ai:=ai−D
, or
leave the value of
ai
unchanged.
It is possible that after an operation the value
ai
becomes negative.
Your goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer
D
and perform changes in such a way, that all
ai
are equal (i.e.
a1=a2=⋯=an
).
Print the required
D
or, if it is impossible to choose such value
D
, print -1.
For example, for array
[2,8]
the value
D=3
is minimum possible because you can obtain the array
[5,5]
if you will add
D
to
2
and subtract
D
from
8
. And for array
[1,4,7,7]
the value
D=3
is also minimum possible. You can add it to
1
and subtract it from
7
and obtain the array
[4,4,4,4]
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of elements in
a
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤100
) — the sequence
a
.
Output
Print one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value
D
such that if you add this value to some
ai
, subtract this value from some
ai
and leave some
ai
without changes, all obtained values become equal.
If it is impossible to choose such value
D
, print -1.
