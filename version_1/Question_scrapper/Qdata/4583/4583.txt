For
3 distinct prime integers
A,B, and
C
(1<A,B,C<2
30
), we define positive integers
X,Y, and
Z as:
X=A⊕B,Y=B⊕C, and
Z=C⊕A, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Given only two integers
X and
Y and the fact that at least one integer amongst
X,Y, and
Z is odd, find the values of
A,B, and
C.
Note:
You need to print the integers
A,B, and
C in ascending order.
It is guaranteed in the input that a unique answer exists.
Input Format
The first line contains one integer
T — the number of test cases. Then
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one line which contains
2 integers
X and
Y.
Output Format
For each test case, print
3 integers —
A,B, and
C in ascending order where
(1<A,B,C<2
30
).

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The answer is
A=2,B=3,C=5. Thus,
X=2⊕3=1,Y=3⊕5=6,Z=2⊕5=7. Note that
X and
Y are same as mentioned in input and the values
X as well as
Z are odd.
Test Case
2: The answer is
A=11,B=2,C=13. Thus,
X=11⊕2=9,Y=2⊕13=15,Z=11⊕13=6. Note that
X and
Y are same as mentioned in input and the values
X as well as
Y are odd. Thus, the values of
A,B, and
C in ascending order are
2,11, and
13.
