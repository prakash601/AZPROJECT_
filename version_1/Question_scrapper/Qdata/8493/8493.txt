A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
You are given a permutation of
1,2,…,n
,
[a1,a2,…,an]
. For integers
i
,
j
such that
1≤i<j≤n
, define
mn(i,j)
as
j
min
k=i
ak
, and define
mx(i,j)
as
j
max
k=i
ak
.
Let us build an undirected graph of
n
vertices, numbered
1
to
n
. For every pair of integers
1≤i<j≤n
, if
mn(i,j)=ai
and
mx(i,j)=aj
both holds, or
mn(i,j)=aj
and
mx(i,j)=ai
both holds, add an undirected edge of length
1
between vertices
i
and
j
.
In this graph, find the length of the shortest path from vertex
1
to vertex
n
. We can prove that
1
and
n
will always be connected via some path, so a shortest path always exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤5⋅104
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2.5⋅105
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1
,
a2
,
…
,
an
(
1≤ai≤n
). It's guaranteed that
a
is a permutation of
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the shortest path from
1
to
n
.
