You are given a convex polygon
P with
N vertices. The vertices (in clockwise order) are
v
1
,v
2
,…v
N
. The coordinates of
v
i
are
(x
i
,y
i
). All vertices have integer coordinates.
A diagonal of
P is a line segment
l joining two distinct vertices
v
i
and
v
j
of
P, such that
l is not already an edge of
P. Every diagonal of
P splits it into two smaller convex polygons, both having positive areas.
The evenness of a diagonal of
P is the minimum of the areas of the two parts obtained when the polygon
P is cut along this diagonal.
Let
S be the sum of the evenness of all diagonals of
P.
Find the value of
2S(mod998244353).
It can be shown that for all polygons
P with integer coordinates, the value
S is an integer.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, the number of vertices of the convex polygon
P. This is followed by
N lines describing the points of the convex polygon, in clockwise order.
The
i
th
subsequent line contains two space-separated integers,
x
i
,y
i
— the coordinates of
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a new line with a single integer, the answer as per the problem statement.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The given polygon is a square with side length
2
. There are only two diagonals, both are identical and split the polygon equally into two halves each with area
2
(
2
)
2
=1. Thus
S=min(1,1)+min(1,1)=2. The value of
2S(mod998244353) is thus
4.
Test case
2: The given polygon is identical to the previous case, except that all coordinates are multiplied by
10
5
. Therefore the given sum gets multiplied by
(10
5
)
2
. Make sure you output the sum modulo
998244353. Here
2S=4⋅10
10
and
4⋅10
10
(mod998244353)=70225880.
Test case
3: There are no diagonals in this polygon, and so the answer is
0.
