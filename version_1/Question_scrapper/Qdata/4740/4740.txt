You are given an array A of size N. Output the maximum value of A[i]%A[j] (ie. A[i] mod A[j]) over all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.
Input
First line of input contains T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each test case contains N, the number of elements in the array.
Second line of each testcase contains N space separated integers in which the ith integer is A[i].
Output
For each testcase output a single integer in a new line: the maximum value of A[i]%A[j].
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤A[i]≤106
