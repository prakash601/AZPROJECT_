Firdavs is living on planet F. There are
N cities (numbered
1 through
N) on this planet; let's denote the value of city
i by
v
i
. Firdavs can travel directly from each city to any other city. When he travels directly from city
x to city
y, he needs to pay
f(x,y)=∣v
y
−v
x
∣+y−x coins (this number can be negative, in which case he receives
−f(x,y) coins).
Let's define a simple path from city
x to city
y with length
k≥1 as a sequence of cities
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
k
such that all cities in this sequence are different,
a
1
=x and
a
k
=y. The cost of such a path is
∑
i=1
k−1
f(a
i
,a
i+1
).
You need to answer some queries for Firdavs. In each query, you are given two cities
x and
y, and you need to find the minimum cost of a simple path from city
x to city
y. Then, you need to find the length of the longest simple path from
x to
y with this cost.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
v
1
,v
2
,…,v
N
.
The following
Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
y.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the minimum cost and the maximum length.

Explanation:
Example case 1: For the first query, there are two paths with cost
4 from city
2 to city
3:
2→1→3: cost
(∣4−2∣+1−2)+(∣5−4∣+3−1)=4, length
3
2→3: cost
∣5−2∣+3−2=4, length
2
All other paths have greater costs, so the minimum cost is
4. Among these two paths, we want the one with greater length, which is
3.
