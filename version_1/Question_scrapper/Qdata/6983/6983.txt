There are
N cells (numbered
1 through
N). Initially, each cell contains a single Chef.
You are given
Q pairs of cell ranges
[L

,R
1
],[L
2
,R

],…,[L
Q
,R
Q
]. Consider a sequence of integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
, where
1≤a
i
≤N for each valid
i. For each
k from
1 to
Q, the following process is performed:
For each
i (
L
k
≤i≤R
k
), the Chef from cell
i moves to cell
a
i
. All Chefs move at the same time.
We check if each cell contains exactly one Chef afterwards. If there is a cell which does not contain exactly one Chef, the sequence
a is invalid and we stop.
You should find a sequence
a which is not invalid. (Note that for such a sequence, each cell contains exactly one Chef at any point.) In addition, you are given an integer
p with the following meaning:
If
p=0, you should find the lexicographically smallest sequence
a.
If
p=1, you should find the lexicographically largest sequence
a.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
T and
p, where
T denotes the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
Q lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
L
i
and
R
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
a

If
p=0, the sequence
a

If
p=1, the sequence

should be the lexicographically largest valid sequence.

Explanation
Example case 1: Whenever a Chef should move from some cell
i, we have
a
i
=i, so the Chefs do not move. That means the sequence
[1,2,3,4,5,1,7] is valid and it can be proved that it is lexicographically smallest, too.

Explanation
Example case 1: The Chefs move like this:
first,
2→5,3→4,4→3,5→2; then, there is still exactly one Chef in each cell
next, Chef
7 stays in his cell
finally, the Chefs in cells
3 and
4 swap places
There is no point when there are two Chefs in a single cell at the same time, so the sequence
[7,5,4,3,2,7,7] is valid and it can be proved that it is lexicographically largest, too.
