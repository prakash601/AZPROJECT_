You are given two strings s and t. Now your task is to print all longest common sub-sequences in lexicographical order.
Example 1:
Input: s = abaaa, t = baabaca
Output: aaaa abaa baaa
Example 2:
Input: s = aaa, t = a
Output: a
Your Task:
You do not need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function all_longest_common_subsequences() which takes string a and b as first and second parameter respectively and returns a list of strings which contains all possible longest common subsequences in lexicographical order.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(n4)
Expected Space Complexity: O(K * n) where K is a constant less than n.
  Constraints:
1 ≤ Length of both strings ≤ 50
