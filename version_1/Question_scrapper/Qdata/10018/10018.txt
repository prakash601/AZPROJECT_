You are given three sequences:
a1,a2,…,an
;
b1,b2,…,bn
;
c1,c2,…,cn
.
For each
i
,
ai≠bi
,
ai≠ci
,
bi≠ci
.
Find a sequence
p1,p2,…,pn
, that satisfy the following conditions:
pi∈{ai,bi,ci}
pi≠p(imodn)+1
.
In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements
i,i+1
adjacent for
i<n
and also elements
1
and
n
) will have equal value.
It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
): the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤100
): the number of elements in the given sequences.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤100
).
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤100
).
The fourth line contains
n
integers
c1,c2,…,cn
(
1≤ci≤100
).
It is guaranteed that
ai≠bi
,
ai≠ci
,
bi≠ci
for all
i
.
Output
For each test case, print
n
integers:
p1,p2,…,pn
(
pi∈{ai,bi,ci}
,
pi≠pimodn+1
).
If there are several solutions, you can print any.

Note
In the first test case
p=[1,2,3]
.
It is a correct answer, because:
p1=1=a1
,
p2=2=b2
,
p3=3=c3
p1≠p2
,
p2≠p3
,
p3≠p1
All possible correct answers to this test case are:
[1,2,3]
,
[1,3,2]
,
[2,1,3]
,
[2,3,1]
,
[3,1,2]
,
[3,2,1]
.
In the second test case
p=[1,2,1,2]
.
In this sequence
p1=a1
,
p2=a2
,
p3=a3
,
p4=a4
. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
In the third test case
p=[1,3,4,3,2,4,2]
.
In this sequence
p1=a1
,
p2=a2
,
p3=b3
,
p4=b4
,
p5=b5
,
p6=c6
,
p7=c7
. Also we can see, that no two adjacent elements of the sequence are equal.
