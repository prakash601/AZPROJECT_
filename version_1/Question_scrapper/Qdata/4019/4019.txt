You are given an array
A of size
N. In one operation, you can do the following:
Select indices
i and
j
(i

=j) and set
A
i
=A
j
.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers, denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is
2. A possible sequence of operations is:
Select indices
1 and
2 and set
A
1
=A
2
=2.
Select indices
3 and
2 and set
A
3
=A
2
=2.
Thus, the final array is
[2,2,2].
