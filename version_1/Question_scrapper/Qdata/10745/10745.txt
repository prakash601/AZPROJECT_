Let
G
be a simple graph. Let
W
be a non-empty subset of vertices. Then
W
is almost-
k
-uniform if for each pair of distinct vertices
u,v∈W
the distance between
u
and
v
is either
k
or
k+1
.
You are given a tree on
n
vertices. For each
i
between
1
and
n
, find the maximum size of an almost-
i
-uniform set.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤5⋅105
) – the number of vertices of the tree.
Then
n−1
lines follows, the
i
-th of which consisting of two space separated integers
ui
,
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
) meaning that there is an edge between vertices
ui
and
vi
.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is tree.
Output
Output a single line containing
n
space separated integers
ai
, where
ai
is the maximum size of an almost-
i
-uniform set.

Note
Consider the first example.
The only maximum almost-
1
-uniform set is
{1,2,3,4}
.
One of the maximum almost-
2
-uniform sets is or
{2,3,5}
, another one is
{2,3,4}
.
A maximum almost-
3
-uniform set is any pair of vertices on distance
3
.
Any single vertex is an almost-
k
-uniform set for
k≥1
.
In the second sample there is an almost-
2
-uniform set of size
4
, and that is
{2,3,5,6}
.
