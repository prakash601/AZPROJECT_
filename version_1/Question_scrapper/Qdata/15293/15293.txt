You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.
Input
The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive ( > 0) and do not exceed 104. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.
Output
Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.
