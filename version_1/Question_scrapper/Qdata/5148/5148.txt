You are given an array
A of size
N. The array will be used to perform
Q queries, where each query is comprised of a pair of integers, denoted by
L
i
and
R
i
.
Before the queries are executed, you are allowed to rearrange the elements in array
A as desired.
Next, an integer variable
X is initialized to 0. For each of the
i-th queries, calculate the sum of elements from
A
L
i
through
A
R
i
inclusive (i.e.
A
L
i
+A
L
i
+1
+⋯+A
R
i
), and add this sum to
X.
The objective of this problem is to find an arrangement of array
A that maximizes the final value of
X after all
Q queries have been processed.
If there are multiple possible arrangements of
A which achieve this maximum value, you can output any.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q — the length of array and number of queries, respectively.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
The next
Q lines describe the queries. The
i-th of these
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
L
i
and
R
i
, describing the range for the
i-th query.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible value of
X. And in the next line, output the rearranged array
A, which achieves that maximum possible value.

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The given array is
[1,2,3,4,5]. Suppose we rearrange it as
[2,4,5,3,1].
Initially,
X=0
In the first query, we add
A
1
+A
2
+A
3
+A
4
to
X. So
X=0+14=14.
In the second query, we add
A
2
+A
3
to
X. So
X=14+9=23.
This is the maximum possible value of
X that we can achieve after the
Q queries. And so, the output is
23, and this rearranged array.
