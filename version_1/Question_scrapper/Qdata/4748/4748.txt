You are given two integers
N and
K. Find number of ordered triplets
(A,B,C) that satisfy the following conditions:
0≤A,B,C<2
N
A,B and
C are distinct
A⊕B⊕C=K
Here,
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the parameters mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of triplets that satisfy the given conditions.
