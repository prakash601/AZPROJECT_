You are given a string
S, each of whose characters is either '0', '1', or '?'.
The badness of a binary string is defined to be the (absolute) difference between the number of
1s and the number of
0s present in it. For example,
001 has badness
∣1−2∣=1 and
11111 has badness
∣5−0∣=5.
Your task is to replace every '?' present in
S with either '0' or '1', such that the badness of the resulting binary string is minimized.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, the number of characters of the string
S.
The second line of each test case contains the string
S, whose characters are either '0', '1', or '?'.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the binary string you obtained by replacing each '?' with either '0' or '1' such that its badness is minimum.
If there are multiple possible strings that minimize badness, you may print any of them.

Explanation:
Test Case
1. There are only two possible strings that can be constructed -
1101 and
0101.
1101 has badness
2, and
0101 has badness
0. Thus, the only possible answer is
0101.
Test Case
2. There are four possible strings that can be made, namely
{0010,0110,1010,1110}. Their respective badness values are
{2,0,0,2}. The minimum value here is
0, attained by both
0110 and
1010 - and so either of these strings is a valid answer.
Test Case
3. There are eight possible strings, of which
000111 is the only one with minimum badness (that being
0).
Test Case
4. There are four possible strings, out of which three of them (
10001,
10011,
11001) have badness
1, which is minimum. All three of them are possible answers.
