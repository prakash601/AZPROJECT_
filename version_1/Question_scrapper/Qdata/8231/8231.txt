Pak Chanek has
n
blank heart-shaped cards. Card
1
is attached directly to the wall while each of the other cards is hanging onto exactly one other card by a piece of string. Specifically, card
i
(
i>1
) is hanging onto card
pi
(
pi<i
).
In the very beginning, Pak Chanek must write one integer number on each card. He does this by choosing any permutation
a
of
[1,2,…,n]
. Then, the number written on card
i
is
ai
.
After that, Pak Chanek must do the following operation
n
times while maintaining a sequence
s
(which is initially empty):
Choose a card
x
such that no other cards are hanging onto it.
Append the number written on card
x
to the end of
s
.
If
x≠1
and the number on card
px
is larger than the number on card
x
, replace the number on card
px
with the number on card
x
.
Remove card
x
.
After that, Pak Chanek will have a sequence
s
with
n
elements. What is the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence
†
of
s
at the end if Pak Chanek does all the steps optimally?
†
A sequence
b
is a subsequence of a sequence
c
if
b
can be obtained from
c
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example,
[3,1]
is a subsequence of
[3,2,1]
,
[4,3,1]
and
[3,1]
, but not
[1,3,3,7]
and
[3,10,4]
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
) — the number of heart-shaped cards.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
p2,p3,…,pn
(
1≤pi<i
) describing which card that each card hangs onto.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of
s
at the end if Pak Chanek does all the steps optimally.

Note
The following is the structure of the cards in the first example.
Pak Chanek can choose the permutation
a=[1,5,4,3,2,6]
.
Let
wi
be the number written on card
i
. Initially,
wi=ai
. Pak Chanek can do the following operations in order:
Select card
5
. Append
w5=2
to the end of
s
. As
w4>w5
, the value of
w4
becomes
2
. Remove card
5
. After this operation,
s=[2]
.
Select card
6
. Append
w6=6
to the end of
s
. As
w2≤w6
, the value of
w2
is left unchanged. Remove card
6
. After this operation,
s=[2,6]
.
Select card
4
. Append
w4=2
to the end of
s
. As
w1≤w4
, the value of
w1
is left unchanged. Remove card
4
. After this operation,
s=[2,6,2]
.
Select card
3
. Append
w3=4
to the end of
s
. As
w2>w3
, the value of
w2
becomes
4
. Remove card
3
. After this operation,
s=[2,6,2,4]
.
Select card
2
. Append
w2=4
to the end of
s
. As
w1≤w2
, the value of
w1
is left unchanged. Remove card
2
. After this operation,
s=[2,6,2,4,4]
.
Select card
1
. Append
w1=1
to the end of
s
. Remove card
1
. After this operation,
s=[2,6,2,4,4,1]
.
One of the longest non-decreasing subsequences of
s=[2,6,2,4,4,1]
is
[2,2,4,4]
. Thus, the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of
s
is
4
. It can be proven that this is indeed the maximum possible length.
