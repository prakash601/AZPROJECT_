You are given a rooted tree with
N nodes numbered from
1 to
N. The root of the tree is node
1. The
i
th
node has parent
P
i
for all
2≤i≤N.
You need to assign a value to each of the nodes such that the MEX of the subtree of node
i is
B
i
. Note that the
MEX of a subtree is the
MEX of the values of all nodes that lie in the subtree.
Find the minimum possible sum of the values of all the nodes in the tree such that the given condition is satisfied. Print
−1 if a valid assignment of values does not exist for all the nodes.
Note that, the subtree of a node
V is the set of all nodes
U such that
V lies on the simple path from
U to the root.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - number of nodes in a tree.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,
B
2
, \ldots,
B
N
denoting the array
B.
The third line of each test case contains
N−1 space-separated integers
P
2
, \ldots,
P
N
, where
P
i
represents parent of node
i and
P
i
<i.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum possible sum of the values of all the nodes in the tree such that the given condition is satisfied. Print
−1 if a valid assignment of values does not exist for all the nodes.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can assign the value
1 to nodes
1 and
2. Thus,
MEX for both subtrees will be equal to
0.
Test case
2: It is impossible to assign values to satisfy all the conditions.
Test case
3: We can assign the values
0,1,0,3, and
3 to nodes
1,2,3,4, and
5 respectively.
Test case
4: We can assign the values
0,0,1,0,0, and
3 to nodes
1,2,3,4,5, and
6 respectively.
