This is an interactive problem.
There is a sequence of positive integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You do not know this sequence, but your task is to find the value of
A
1
⊕A
2
⊕…⊕A
N
, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
You may ask up to
20 questions. In each question, you should choose an integer
K (
1≤K≤2⋅10
6
) and the interactor responds with the value of
(A
1
⊕K)+(A
2
⊕K)+…+(A
N
⊕K).
Interaction
First, you should read a line containing a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for
T test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer
N.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers
1 and
K, where
1≤K≤2⋅10
6
. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your question or
−1 if the question is invalid or you asked more than
20 questions.
Finally, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers
2 and
X, where
X=A
1
⊕A
2
⊕…⊕A
N
. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer:
1 if your answer was correct or
−1 if it was incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.
Note that when you receive an answer
−1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Example
You             Grader
                1
                4

Explanation
Example case 1: The hidden sequence is
A=[1,2,3,4].
We ask a question with
K=2. The grader responds with
A
1
⊕2+A
2
⊕2+A
3
⊕2+A
4
⊕2=10.
Then, we ask a question with
K=5 and the grader responds with
A
1
⊕5+A
2
⊕5+A
3
⊕5+A
4
⊕5=18.
Therefore,
A
1
⊕A
2
⊕A
3
⊕A
4
=4.
