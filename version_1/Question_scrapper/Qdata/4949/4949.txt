You are given an integer
N and a digit
D. Find the minimum non-negetive integer you should add to
N such that the final value of
N does not contain the digit
D.
Input Format
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two integers
N and
D on a single line denoting the original number and the digit you need to avoid.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the minimum non-negetive integer you should add to
N.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
N=21 does not contain the digit
D=5. Hence there is no need to add any integers to
N.
Test case
2: If
1 is added to
N=8, it becomes equal to
9, which does not contain the digit
D=8.
Test case
3: The minimum integer you should add to
N=100 such that the final value of
N does not contain the digit
D=0 is
11.
Test case
5: The minimum integer which is greater than
434356 and does not contain the digit
D=3 is
440000. So we should add
440000−434356=5644.
