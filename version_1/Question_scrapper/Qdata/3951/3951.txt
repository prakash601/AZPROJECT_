Alice has a standard deck of
52 cards. She wants to play a card game with
K−1 of her friends. This particular game requires each person to have an equal number of cards, so Alice needs to discard a certain number of cards from her deck so that she can equally distribute the remaining cards amongst her and her friends.
Find the minimum number of cards Alice has to discard such that she can play the game.
Note: It doesn't matter which person gets which card. The only thing that matters is that each person should have an equal number of cards.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing a single integer
K — the number of people playing the game (including Alice).
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of cards Alice has to discard from her deck such that she can play the game with her friends.
