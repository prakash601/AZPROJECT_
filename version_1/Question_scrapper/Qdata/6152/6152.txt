You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. For each
k (
1≤k≤N), let's define a function
f(k) in the following way:
Consider a sequence
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
, which is created by setting
A
k
=0. Formally,
B
k
=0 and
B
i
=A
i
for each valid
i

=k.
f(k) is the number of ways to split the sequence
B into two non-empty contiguous subsequences with equal sums.
Find the sum
S=f(1)+f(2)+…+f(N).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum
S.
