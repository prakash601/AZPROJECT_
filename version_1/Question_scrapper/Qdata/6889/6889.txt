There are
N integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
on a circle. For each valid
i,
A
i
and
A
i+1
are adjacent;
A
1
and
A
N
are also adjacent.
Chef has a sequence of integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
, which he may use to perform any number of operations (including zero). In one operation, he should do the following:
Choose an integer
i (
1≤i≤N).
Choose
i consecutive integers on the circle.
Choose a sign
S=±1 and add
S⋅B
i
to each of the chosen integers. In other words, either add
B
to each of them or subtract
B
from each of them.
The goal is to make all the integers on the circle equal to
0. Can Chef achieve it using these operations?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
The third line contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make all integers on the circle equal to
0 or "NO" if it is impossible.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We can make everything
0 using two operations: choose
i=4 and change the circular sequence
(1,1,3,3,2) to
(1−1,1−1,3−1,3−1,2)=(0,0,2,2,2), then choose
i=3 and change it to
(0,0,2−2,2−2,2−2)=(0,0,0,0,0).
Example case 2: The parities of integers on the circle cannot change, so they cannot become
0.
