You are given an array
a of length
N and
Q queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers,
l and
r. Answer each query with the following: if we take every subsequence of the elements with indices between
l and
r (inclusive) and write down their products, what will be the smallest missing positive integer?
A subsequence of an array is a sequence you obtain by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of the array. The product of the empty subsequence is defined to be
1.
###Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a

Each of the next
Q lines contains two space-separated integers,
l and
r, denoting the query's range.
###Output For each query, output the smallest missing subsequence product on a new line.

Explanation:
The array is
[2,3,2,5,4].
The first query asks about the range
[2,3]. The subsequences of this range are
[],
[3],
[2], and
[3,2]. They have products
1,
3,
2, and
6, respectively. The smallest missing positive integer from the list of products is
4.
The second query asks about the range
[1,4].
[] has product
1
[2] has product
2
[3] has product
3
[2,2] has product
4
[5] has product
5
[2,3] has product
6
But
7 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.
The third query asks about the range
[3,5].
[] has product
1
[2] has product
2
But
3 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.
