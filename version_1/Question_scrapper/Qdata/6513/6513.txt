Chef has a hidden permutation
P of
N integers and challenges you to find
P using at most
N−1 queries of the following kind:
Query: A permutation
Q of length
N.
Response: Chef generates a permutation
P
ˉ
defined as
P
i
ˉ
=P
Q
i
,1≤i≤N.
Chef responds with all such indices where
P
i
is the maximum element of the prefix of length
i, i.e.,
Chef will respond with all
1≤i≤N that satisfy
P
i
ˉ
=max
{
P
1
ˉ
,
P
2
ˉ
,…,
P
ˉ
i
}.
Note that a permutation of length
N consists of all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Interaction
First, you should read a line containing a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer
N, denoting the length of Chef's hidden permutation.
To make a query, print a line starting with
? followed by
N space separated integers
Q
1
,Q
2
,…,Q
N
denoting the permutation
Q.
Note that
1≤Q
i
≤N and
Q
i
are distinct.
To read Chef's response, input a single line which can be of two types:
Starting with an integer
K denoting the number of indices in the response followed by
K space separated integers
i
1
,i
2
,…,i
k
, the indices satisfying the condition.
A single integer
−1 denoting that you made either an ill-formed query or too many of them (exceeded
N−1).
To guess the permutation
P, print a line starting with
! followed by
N space separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
denoting the permutation. Then, read a line containing a single integer which is
1 if your guess was correct and
−1 otherwise or if it was ill-formed.
Don't forget to read the result of your guess after every test case which is a
1 or a
−1.
Note that when you receive an answer
−1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤500
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
500.

The hidden permutation is
P={2,4,3,1}.
In the first query,
P
ˉ
={3,4,1,2}. Thus, Chef replies with indices
{1,2}.
In the second query,
P
ˉ
={4,2,3,1}. Thus, Chef replies with the only index
{1}.
In the third query,
P
ˉ
={1,2,3,4}. Thus, Chef replies with
{1,2,3,4}.
