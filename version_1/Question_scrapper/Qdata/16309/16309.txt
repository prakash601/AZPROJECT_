A line on the plane is described by an equation Ax + By + C = 0. You are to find any point on this line, whose coordinates are integer numbers from  - 5·1018 to 5·1018 inclusive, or to find out that such points do not exist.
Input
The first line contains three integers A, B and C ( - 2·109 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 2·109) — corresponding coefficients of the line equation. It is guaranteed that A2 + B2 > 0.
Output
If the required point exists, output its coordinates, otherwise output -1.
