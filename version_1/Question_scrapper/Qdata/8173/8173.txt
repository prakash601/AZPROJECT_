You are given a permutation
a1,a2,…,an
of size
n
, where each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once.
You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero):
Choose any three indices
i,j,k
(
1≤i<j<k≤n
).
If
ai>ak
, replace
ai
with
ai+aj
. Otherwise, swap
aj
and
ak
.
Determine whether you can make the array
a
sorted in non-descending order.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤10
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
,
ai≠aj
if
i≠j
) — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if the array can be sorted in non-descending order, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "YES", "yEs" and "yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case,
[1,2,3]
is already sorted in non-descending order.
In the second test case, we can choose
i=1,j=2,k=3
. Since
a1≤a3
, swap
a2
and
a3
, the array then becomes
[1,2,3]
, which is sorted in non-descending order.
In the seventh test case, we can do the following operations successively:
Choose
i=5,j=6,k=7
. Since
a5≤a7
, swap
a6
and
a7
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,7,4,5,3]
.
Choose
i=5,j=6,k=7
. Since
a5>a7
, replace
a5
with
a5+a6=9
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,7,9,5,3]
.
Choose
i=2,j=5,k=7
. Since
a2≤a7
, swap
a5
and
a7
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,7,3,5,9]
.
Choose
i=2,j=4,k=6
. Since
a2≤a6
, swap
a4
and
a6
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,5,3,7,9]
.
Choose
i=1,j=3,k=5
. Since
a1≤a5
, swap
a3
and
a5
, the array then becomes
[1,2,3,5,6,7,9]
, which is sorted in non-descending order.
In the third, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth test cases, it can be shown that the array cannot be sorted in non-descending order.
