Two friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than
d1
and
it's the first time they speak to each other or
at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than
d2
.
We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For
N
moments, you'll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.
Input
The first line contains one integer number
N
(
2≤N≤100000
) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.
The second line contains two integer numbers
d1
and
d2 (0<d1<d2<1000)
.
The next
N
lines contains four integer numbers
Ax,Ay,Bx,By
(
0≤Ax,Ay,Bx,By≤1000
) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.
Output
Output contains one integer number that represents how many times friends will say "Hello!" to each other.

Note
Explanation: Friends should send signals 2 times to each other, first time around point
A2
and
B2
and second time during A's travel from point
A3
to
A4
while B stays in point
B3=B4
