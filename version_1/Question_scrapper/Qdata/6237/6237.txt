The beauty of a sequence of non-negative integers is computed in the following way: for each of its non-empty (not necessarily contiguous) subsequences, compute the XOR of all elements of this subsequence; then, sum up all the XORs you obtained.
Let
F(N,B) denotes the number of non-negative integer sequences with length
N which have beauty
B. You are given three integers
N,
X and
M. Find the smallest non-negative integer
B such that
F(N,B)modM=X, or determine that there is no such
B. Since even the smallest such
B might be very large, compute its remainder modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
X and
M.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest valid
B (modulo
998,244,353), or
−1 if there is no valid
B.
