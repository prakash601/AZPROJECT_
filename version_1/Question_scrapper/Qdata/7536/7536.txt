For an array
B consisting of distinct integers, its number of inversions is equal to the number of pairs
(i,j) with
1≤i<j≤M such that
B
i
>B
j
, where
M is the size of
B. If this number is odd, we will call array
B odd. Otherwise, we will call it even.
Let's call a permutation
P of integers from
1 to
K good, if there exists a way to split it into two subsequences, each of which is odd.
For example, we can split
[5,1,3,2,6,4] into subsequences
[5,3,2] and
[1,6,4], both of which are odd. There is no such split for the permutation
[1,2,4,3,5,6].
For each
K from
1 to
N, find the number of permutations of integers from
1 to
K, which are good. As this number may be very high, output each number modulo some prime
.
Input Format
The only line of the input contains two integers
N,P.
Output Format
Print
N space-separated integers, the
K
th
of which is the number of permutations of integers from
1 to
K which are good. Output all values modulo
P.
