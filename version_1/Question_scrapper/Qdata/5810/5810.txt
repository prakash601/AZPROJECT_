You are given
N edge-weighted trees
T

,T

,…,T

having
M

N
nodes respectively. You also have an array
A of
N−1 positive integers.
You need to connect these
N trees using
N−1 edges such that each of these edges have weights equal to
A
i
for some
i∈[1,N−1] and each of the
A
i
must be used exactly once. Note that after connecting these edges, a single large tree
T will form consisting of
(M

+M

+…+M
N
) nodes. Find the minimum possible sum of distances between each pair of nodes in the final tree
T.
Since this value can be large, output the value mod
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
N, denoting the number of trees.
Then, you are given the
N trees. The description of each tree is as follows:
The first line contains the integer
M
i
(1≤i≤N), the number of nodes in
i-th tree.
The next
M
i
−1 lines describe the edges of the
i-th tree. The
j-th of these
M
i
−1 lines contains
3 space-separated integers
u
ij
,v
ij
and
w
ij
, describing that there is an edge of weight
w
ij
connecting the nodes
u
ij
and
v
ij
in tree
T
i
.
The final line contains
N−1 space-separated integers,
A

.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum sum of distances between each pair of nodes in tree
T, modulo
998244353.
