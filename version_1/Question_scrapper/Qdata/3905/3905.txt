Explanation:
Test case
1:
For combo
A, the Popcorn bucket lasts
3 minutes, and the Coke cup lasts
6 minutes, so Vishesh gets a satisfaction of
3+6=9 if he buys this combo.
For combo
B, the Popcorn bucket lasts
5 minutes, and the Coke cup lasts
10 minutes, so Vishesh gets a satisfaction of
5+10=15 if he buys this combo.
For combo
C, the Popcorn bucket lasts
8 minutes, and the Coke cup lasts
7 minutes, so Vishesh gets a satisfaction of
8+7=15 if he buys this combo.
Therefore Vishesh's maximum satisfaction is
15.
