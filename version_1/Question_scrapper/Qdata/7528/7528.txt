There are
N computer screens in a line from left to right. The
i
th
screen from left displays number
i(1≤i≤N). Now these computer screens are divided into
m groups. You are given

and so on. Now there is a computer virus which is infecting these computer screens. Initially, all screens are uninfected.
Now, these computers perform the following operations as long as there exists an uninfected screen:
During each operation step, two things happen. First, the virus infects the rightmost uninfected screen in each group. Then, every uninfected screen updates the value on its screen to the sum of all values on uninfected screens to its left, and its own screen, modulo

###Sample Output: 33
###EXPLANATION: There are two groups.
Group1   Group2
1 2 3   4 5 6 (3 and 6 infected)
1 3 3   7 12 6 (update value on each uninfected screen by sum of all numbers on uninfected screens to its left including the current screen modulo 1000000007)
1 3 3   7 12 6 (Now virus infects the rightmost uninfected computer in each group)
1 3 3   8 12 6 (update value on each uninfected screen by sum of all numbers on uninfected screens to its left including the current screen modulo 1000000007)
1 3 3   8 12 6(Virus infects the rightmost uninfected computer in each group)
Answer = (1+3+3+8+12+6)% 1000000007 = 33
