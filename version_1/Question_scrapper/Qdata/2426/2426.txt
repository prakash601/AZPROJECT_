Given a Binary Tree, write a function to check whether the given Binary Tree is Complete Binary Tree or not. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes should be as much close to left as possible.
Example 1:
Input:
 1
 / \
 2 3
Output:
Complete Binary Tree
Example 2:
Input:
 1
 / \
 2 3
 \ / \
 4 5 6
Output:
Not Complete Binary Tree
Constraints:
1<=Number of Node<=100
0 <= Data of a node <= 106
Your Task:
You don't need to take input. Just complete the function isCompleteBT() that takes root node as a parameter and returns true, if the tree is Complete else returns false.
