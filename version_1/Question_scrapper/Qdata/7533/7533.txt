You are given a directed weighted graph with
P vertices, labelled from
0 to
P−1.
P is a prime number. You are also given an integer
K.
For each vertex
u, there is an edge from vertex
u to vertex
(K⋅u+i)modP for all
0≤i≤K−1. The weight of an edge directed from the vertex
u to the vertex
(K⋅u+i)modP is equal to
i.
You will be given
Q queries. In each query you will be given two vertices
X and
Y and you have to determine the minimum cost of going from
X to
Y. If a path does not exists between
X and
Y, print
−1.
Input Format
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
T. The description of
T testcases as follows.
The first line of each test contains
3 space separated integers
P,K,Q.
Then
Q lines follow. Each of the
Q lines contains two space separated integers
X and
Y denoting a query.
Output Format
For each query print a single integer denoting the minimum cost of going from
X to
Y. If a path does not exist print
−1.
