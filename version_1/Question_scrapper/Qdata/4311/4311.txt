Chef is interested in the sum of GCDs of all prefixes of a permutation of the integers
{1,2,…,N}.
Formally, for a permutation
P=[P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
] of
{1,2,…,N}, let us define a function
F
i
=gcd(A
1
,A
2
,A
3
,…,A
i
). Chef is interested in the value of
F
1
+F
2
+…+F
N
.
Now, Chef wants to find a permutation of
{1,2,…,N} which has the given sum equal to
X. Please help Chef find one such permutation. In case there is no such permutation, print
−1. In case of multiple answers, any of them will be accepted.
A permutation of
{1,2,…,N} is a sequence of numbers from
1 to
N in which each number occurs exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers
N and
X denoting the length of required permutation and the required sum of GCDs of all prefixes respectively.
Output Format
If there is a valid permutation that satisfies the required condition, then:
In a single line, output
N space-separated integers denoting the required permutation permutation.
If there is no permutation, print
−1 in a single line.
Constraints
1≤T≤10

1≤N≤1000
1≤X≤2⋅N−1
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
3⋅10

3 2 1
Explanation:
Test case
1: The only possible permutation has a sum of
1, as required.
Test case
2: The two permutations of length
2 are:
[1,2] with a value of
1+1=2
[2,1] with a value of
2+1=3
None of them have a sum of
X=1, so we output
−1.
Test case
3: For
P=[2,4,3,1], we have:
F
1
=2
F
2
=gcd(2,4)=2
F
3
=gcd(2,4,3)=1
F
4
=gcd(2,4,3,1)=1
The sum of these values is
6, as required.
