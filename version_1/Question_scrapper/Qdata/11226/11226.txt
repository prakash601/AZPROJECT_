Let's define a function
f(p)
on a permutation
p
as follows. Let
gi
be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements
p1
,
p2
, ...,
pi
(in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length
i
). Then
f(p)
is the number of distinct elements among
g1
,
g2
, ...,
gn
.
Let
fmax(n)
be the maximum value of
f(p)
among all permutations
p
of integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
.
Given an integers
n
, count the number of permutations
p
of integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
, such that
f(p)
is equal to
fmax(n)
. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by
1000000007=109+7
.
Input
The only line contains the integer
n
(
2≤n≤106
) — the length of the permutations.
Output
The only line should contain your answer modulo
109+7
.

Note
Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length
3
:
[1,2,3]
,
f(p)=1
.
[1,3,2]
,
f(p)=1
.
[2,1,3]
,
f(p)=2
.
[2,3,1]
,
f(p)=2
.
[3,1,2]
,
f(p)=2
.
[3,2,1]
,
f(p)=2
.
The maximum value
fmax(3)=2
, and there are
4
permutations
p
such that
f(p)=2
.
