You have
2 counters
a and
b, both initialised as
0. You also have a score initialised as
0.
At the start of every minute from minute
1 to minute
N, you must increase either
a or
b by
1.
Additionally, there are
M events. The
i
th
event happens at minute
T
i
+0.5 and has type
C
i
(C
i
∈{1,2}).
At each event, the counters or the score is updated as:
if (type == 1):
    if (a > b):
        score = score + 1;
    else:
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
else:
    if (a < b):
        score = score + 1;
    else:
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
Your task is to maximise the score after
N minutes have passed.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of minutes and the number of events.
The second line of each test case contains
M integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: We will demonstrate a way to achieve a score of
2.
In the first minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=1 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
In the second minute, we will increase
b by
1 so that
a=1 and
b=1. Since there is an event with type
2 and
a is not less than
b, our score remains
1 and the counters are reset.
In the third minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=1 and
b=0. There are no events in this minute.
In the fourth minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=2 and
b=0. There are no events in this minute.
In the fifth minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=3 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
Thus, the total score achieved is
2.
It can be shown that there is no possible way for our score to be greater than
2.
Test case
2: We will demonstrate a way to achieve a score of
5.
In the first minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=1 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
In the second minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=2 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
In the third minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=3 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
In the fourth minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=4 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
In the fifth minute, we will increase
a by
1 so that
a=5 and
b=0. Since there is an event with type
1 and
a>b our score increases by
1.
Thus, the total score achieved is
5.
It can be shown that there is no possible way for our score to be greater than
5.
