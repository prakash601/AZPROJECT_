There are
N cards on a table, out of which
X cards are face-up and the remaining are face-down.
In one operation, we can do the following:
Select any one card and flip it (i.e. if it was initially face-up, after the operation, it will be face-down and vice versa)
What is the minimum number of operations we must perform so that all the cards face in the same direction (i.e. either all are face-up or all are face-down)?
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X — the total number of cards and the number of cards which are initially face-up.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of cards you must flip so that all the cards face in the same direction.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: All the cards are already facing down. Therefore we do not need to perform any operations.
Test Case 2:
2 cards are facing up and
2 cards are facing down. Therefore we can flip the
2 cards which are initially facing down.
Test Case 3: All the cards are already facing up. Therefore we do not need to perform any operations.
Test Case 4:
2 cards are facing up and
8 cards are facing down. Therefore we can flip the
2 cards which are initially facing up.
