Chef has an array
A of length
N.
An index
i is called strong if we can change the gcd of the whole array just by changing the value of
A
i
.
Determine the number of strong indices in the array.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer
N denoting the size of the array
A.
Second line contains
N space separated integers

Explanation:
Test Case
1: All the indices are strong.
For index
1 you can change the element to
10 which changes the gcd of the array to
10.
For index
2 you can change the element to
12 which changes the gcd of the array to
1.
For index
3 you can change the element to
12 which changes the gcd of the array to
1.
Test Case
2: No index is strong. If you change any single element, gcd still remains the same.
Test Case
3: All the indices are strong. You can change any element to
3. This changes the gcd of the array to
1.
