You have
n
rectangles, the
i
-th rectangle has height
hi
and width
wi
.
You are asked
q
queries of the form
hs ws hb wb
.
For each query output, the total area of rectangles you own that can fit a rectangle of height
hs
and width
ws
while also fitting in a rectangle of height
hb
and width
wb
. In other words, print
∑hi⋅wi
for
i
such that
hs<hi<hb
and
ws<wi<wb
.
Please note, that if two rectangles have the same height or the same width, then they cannot fit inside each other. Also note that you cannot rotate rectangles.
Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case two integers
n,q
(
1≤n≤105
;
1≤q≤105
) — the number of rectangles you own and the number of queries.
Then
n
lines follow, each containing two integers
hi,wi
(
1≤hi,wi≤1000
) — the height and width of the
i
-th rectangle.
Then
q
lines follow, each containing four integers
hs,ws,hb,wb
(
1≤hs<hb, ws<wb≤1000
) — the description of each query.
The sum of
q
over all test cases does not exceed
105
, and the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, output
q
lines, the
i
-th line containing the answer to the
i
-th query.

Note
In the first test case, there is only one query. We need to find the sum of areas of all rectangles that can fit a
1×1
rectangle inside of it and fit into a
3×4
rectangle.
Only the
2×3
rectangle works, because
1<2
(comparing heights) and
1<3
(comparing widths), so the
1×1
rectangle fits inside, and
2<3
(comparing heights) and
3<4
(comparing widths), so it fits inside the
3×4
rectangle. The
3×2
rectangle is too tall to fit in a
3×4
rectangle. The total area is
2⋅3=6
.
