You are given the height
H (in metres) and mass
M (in kilograms) of Chef. The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person is computed as
H
2
M
.
Report the category into which Chef falls, based on his BMI:
Category 1: Underweight if BMI
≤18
Category 2: Normal weight if BMI
∈{19,
20,
…,
24}
Category 3: Overweight if BMI
∈{25,
26,
…,
29}
Category 4: Obesity if BMI
≥30
###Input:
The first line of input will contain an integer,
T, which denotes the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, with two space separated integers,
M,H, which denote the mass and height of Chef respectively.
###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line,
1,2,3 or
4, based on the category in which Chef falls.
###Constraints

Explanation:
Case 1: Since
H
2
M
=

2
72
=18, therefore person falls in category
1.
Case 2: Since
H
2
M
=

2
80
=20, therefore person falls in category
2.
Case 3: Since
H

M
=

2
120
=30, therefore person falls in category
4.
