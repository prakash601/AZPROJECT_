You have a connected undirected graph made of
n
nodes and
m
edges. The
i
-th node has a value
vi
and a target value
ti
.
In an operation, you can choose an edge
(i,j)
and add
k
to both
vi
and
vj
, where
k
can be any integer. In particular,
k
can be negative.
Your task to determine if it is possible that by doing some finite number of operations (possibly zero), you can achieve for every node
i
,
vi=ti
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
), the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
m
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
,
n−1≤m≤min(2⋅105,
n(n−1)
2
)
) — the number of nodes and edges respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
v1…,vn
(
−109≤vi≤109
) — initial values of nodes.
The third line contains
n
integers
t1…,tn
(
−109≤ti≤109
) — target values of nodes.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
i
and
j
representing an edge between node
i
and node
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
,
i≠j
).
It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there is at most one edge between the same pair of nodes.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all testcases does not exceed
2⋅105
and the sum of
m
over all testcases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, if it is possible for every node to reach its target after some number of operations, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

Note
Here is a visualization of the first test case (the orange values denote the initial values and the blue ones the desired values):
One possible order of operations to obtain the desired values for each node is the following:
Operation
1
: Add
2
to nodes
2
and
3
.
Operation
2
: Add
−2
to nodes
1
and
4
.
Operation
3
: Add
6
to nodes
3
and
4
.
Now we can see that in total we added
−2
to node
1
,
2
to node
2
,
8
to node
3
and
4
to node
4
which brings each node exactly to it's desired value.
For the graph from the second test case it's impossible to get the target values.
