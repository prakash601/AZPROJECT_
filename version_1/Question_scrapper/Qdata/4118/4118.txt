You are given two positive integers
A and
B. You need to construct two different binary strings (i.e, they are strings which consist of only
0s and
1s), which satisfy these two conditions:
Both the strings should be palindromes.
Each string should have exactly
A
0s, and exactly
B
1s in them.
Output Yes if two such different binary strings can be constructed and No otherwise.
Note:
A string is said to be a palindrome, if the string and the reverse of the string are identical.
Two strings are said to be different if either their lengths are different, or if they differ in at least one character.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers,
A and
B, in a new line.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line 'Yes', if you can construct two different binary strings satisfying the conditions. If not, output No.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yes, YES, and YEs will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider the binary strings
0110 and
1001. Both of them are palindromes, and both of them have exactly
2
0s, and
2
1s. Hence we can construct them, and so the answer is Yes.
Test case
2: Consider the binary strings
01110 and
10101. Both of them are palindromes, and both of them have exactly
2
0s, and
3
1s. Hence we can construct them, and so the answer is Yes.
Test case
3: There is no way to construct two such different strings. Hence the answer is No.
