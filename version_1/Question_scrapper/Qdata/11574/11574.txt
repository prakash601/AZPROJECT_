There are
n
cities along the road, which can be represented as a straight line. The
i
-th city is situated at the distance of
ai
kilometers from the origin. All cities are situated in the same direction from the origin. There are
m
trucks travelling from one city to another.
Each truck can be described by
4
integers: starting city
si
, finishing city
fi
, fuel consumption
ci
and number of possible refuelings
ri
. The
i
-th truck will spend
ci
litres of fuel per one kilometer.
When a truck arrives in some city, it can be refueled (but refueling is impossible in the middle of nowhere). The
i
-th truck can be refueled at most
ri
times. Each refueling makes truck's gas-tank full. All trucks start with full gas-tank.
All trucks will have gas-tanks of the same size
V
litres. You should find minimum possible
V
such that all trucks can reach their destinations without refueling more times than allowed.
Input
First line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤400
,
1≤m≤250000
) — the number of cities and trucks.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
,
ai<ai+1
) — positions of cities in the ascending order.
Next
m
lines contains
4
integers each. The
i
-th line contains integers
si
,
fi
,
ci
,
ri
(
1≤si<fi≤n
,
1≤ci≤109
,
0≤ri≤n
) — the description of the
i
-th truck.
Output
Print the only integer — minimum possible size of gas-tanks
V
such that all trucks can reach their destinations.

Note
Let's look at queries in details:
the
1
-st truck must arrive at position
7
from
2
without refuelling, so it needs gas-tank of volume at least
50
.
the
2
-nd truck must arrive at position
17
from
2
and can be refueled at any city (if it is on the path between starting point and ending point), so it needs gas-tank of volume at least
48
.
the
3
-rd truck must arrive at position
14
from
10
, there is no city between, so it needs gas-tank of volume at least
52
.
the
4
-th truck must arrive at position
17
from
10
and can be refueled only one time: it's optimal to refuel at
5
-th city (position
14
) so it needs gas-tank of volume at least
40
.
the
5
-th truck has the same description, so it also needs gas-tank of volume at least
40
.
the
6
-th truck must arrive at position
14
from
2
and can be refueled two times: first time in city
2
or
3
and second time in city
4
so it needs gas-tank of volume at least
55
.
