You are given a sequence of positive integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
. You may change up to two elements of this sequence, each of them to any positive integer (not necessarily the same for two elements). Let's denote the resulting sequence by
b
1
,b
2
,…,b
N
.
Consider all
2
N
subsequences of
b
1
,b
2
,…,b
N
. For each subsequence, compute the sum of its elements (
0 for the empty subsequence). Let's denote the set of these sums by
S; note that a set contains each integer at most once. Finally, NOSS is the size of set
S. For example, if
[b
1
,b
2
,b
3
]=[17,23,40], then
S={0,17,23,40,57,63,80} and NOSS is
7.
Find the maximum possible NOSS.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible NOSS.

Explanation:
Example case 1: One possible way is to change
3 to
10 and
5 to
20. Then
S={0…7,10…17,20…27,30…37} (
a…b denotes all integer from
a to
b inclusive) and NOSS is
32.
Example case 2: One possible way is to change one element of the initial sequence from
1 to
10 and another from
1 to
20.
Example case 3: The optimal NOSS is achieved even if nothing is changed.
