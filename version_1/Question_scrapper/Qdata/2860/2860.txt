Given a matrix(2D array) M of size N*N consisting of 0s and 1s only. The task is to find the column with maximum number of 0s.
Example:
Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{1, 1, 0},
 {1, 1, 0},
 {1, 1, 0}}
Output:2
Explanation:
2nd column (0-based indexing) 
is having 3 zeros which is 
maximum among all columns.
  Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function () which should return the r with the maximum number of zeros. If more than one column exists, print the one which comes first.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 102
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1
