We have taken a great initiative to have a women only quota for admissions. The admission criteria is to solve one graph problem. Alice, being a woman, seeks admission under this quota and wants your help to solve the following problem.
You are given an integer
N. Construct a good graph with
N vertices.
A good graph is one that satisfies the following conditions:
The graph is simple (i.e, doesn't contain self-loops or multiedges), undirected, and connected.
If
∣i−j∣ is a prime number, then
deg
i

=deg
j
, where
deg
i
is the degree of vertex
i.
Among all graphs on
N vertices that satisfy the above two conditions, a good graph is one that then , i.e,
max
i=1
N
deg
i
is minimized.
If such a graph exists, find any one of them. If no such graph exists, print
−1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of nodes in the graph.
Output Format
For each test case, output the answer as follows:
If no good graph on
N vertices exists, print
−1 on a new line.
Otherwise, first print a single integer
X: the maximum degree of a good graph on
N vertices.
On the next line, print a single integer
M: the number of edges in the graph you construct.
Then, print
M lines. The
i-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
.
The graph you print should satisfy all the conditions laid out in the statement.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
2≤N≤1000
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
5000.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
N=2, and we have
deg
1
=deg
2
=1 which is the best we can do.
Test case
2:
N=3, and we have
deg
1
=deg
2
=1 and
deg
3
=2.
∣1−3∣=2 is prime, and
1 and
3 have different degrees as required.
Test case
3:
N=4, and we have
deg
1
=deg
2
=2,
deg
3
=deg
4
=1. It's easy to verify that any pair with a difference of
2 or
3 have different degrees.
