Two players X and Y are playing a game in which there are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins. They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player who has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to maximize the number of coins collected by X, assuming Y also plays optimally.
Return the maximum coins X could get while playing the game. Initially, X starts the game.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
Q[] = {8, 15, 3, 7}
Output: 22
Explanation: Player X starts and picks 7. Player Y 
picks the pot containing 8. Player X picks the pot
containing . Player  picks 3.
Total coins collected by  = 7 + 15 = 22.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
A[] = {2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 4

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxCoins() which takes an integer N and an array of size N  as input and returns the maximum coins collected by player X.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 500
1 <= A[i] <= 103
