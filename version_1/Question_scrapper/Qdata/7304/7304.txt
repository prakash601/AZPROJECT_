You are given an array
A, consisting of
N distinct elements.
Find the sum of
Score over all
N! possible permutations of
A.
Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated distinct integers

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Two permutations of
A are
[2,3] and
[3,2].
Score of
[2,3]=f(1,1)+f(2,2)+f(1,2)=2+3+2
∣
3=8.
Score of
[3,2]=f(1,1)+f(2,2)+f(1,2)=3+2+3
∣
2=8.
So, the required sum is
16.
