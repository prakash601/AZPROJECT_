You are given an integer
N.
Print a permutation
P of
[1,2,…,N] such that the following condition holds:
For any index
i (1≤i<N),
P
i
×P
i+1
is not a perfect square.
If there are multiple correct answers, you may print any of them.
Note: A permutation of
[1,2,…,N] is a rearrangement of those numbers.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
- the length of the required permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, print
N space-separated integers representing the valid permutation on a single line.
If there are multiple correct answers, you may print any of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤500

Explanation:
Test case
1:
2×1=2 is not a perfect square. Note that
[1,2] is also a valid answer for this case, and will be accepted.
Test case
2:
3×1=3 and
1×2=2 are not perfect squares.
Test case
3:
4×2=8,2×3=6,3×1=3 are all not perfect squares.
