The young but promising paparazzi Gennady wants to finally become famous. To do this, he wants to take a picture of a new super star during her walk in the mountains.
It is known that the star's path in the mountains consists of
N sections. For each valid
i, the
i-th section is a vertical half-open interval with coordinates
x=i and
y∈[0,h
i
).
For each valid
i and
j, our hero can take a picture of the star located in the
i-th section of the walk when he is in the
j-th section only if he can see the star ― that is,
i<j and for each
k (
i<k<j), the half-open interval that makes up the
k-th section must not intersect the line segment
[(i,h
i
),(j,h
j
)].
Gennady is a paparazzi, not a programmer, so he asks you to determine the maximum distance from which he can take a picture of the star, which is the maximum value of
j−i over all pairs
(i,j). Help him become famous!
