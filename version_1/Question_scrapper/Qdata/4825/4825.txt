After solving programming problems for years, Chef has become lazy and decided to get a better physique by doing some weight lifting exercises.
On any regular day, Chef does
N exercises at times

(in minutes, all distinct) and each exercise provides a tension of

units. In the period between two consecutive exercises, his muscles relax
R units of tension per minute.
More formally, Chef's tension is described by a number
x. Before any workouts,
x=0. When he does a workout at time
A
i
, the tension
x instantly increases by
B
. Between workouts, the number
x decreases by
R units per minute, maximized with
0.
Considering the time of exercise and hence tension to be negligible, find the maximum tension he will be feeling in his muscles during the entire period of his workout.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains
3 lines of input.
The first line will contain
2 space-separated integers
N,R, number of timestamps at which Chef performs his exercise, and units of tension relaxed per minute.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum amount of tension Chef will have in his muscles.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Since there is only
1 exercise, the maximum tension is equal to the tension provided by that exercise, i.e,
10 units.
Test Case 2: At time
t=10, Chef has
10 units of tension.
From
t=10 to
t=11, his muscles releases
2 unit of tension and at
t=11, he further gains
10 units of tension to have total of
10−2+10=18 units of tension.
So the maximum tension Chef feels in his muscles is
18 units.
Test Case 3: At time
t=1, Chef has
1 unit of tension.
From
t=1 to
t=2, his muscles releases
1 unit of tension and at
t=2, he further gains
2 units of tension to have total of
1−1+2=2 units of tension.
From
t=2 to
t=3, his muscles releases
1 unit of tension and at
t=3, he further gains
3 units of tension to have total of
2−1+3=4 units of tension.
So the maximum tension Chef feels in his muscles is
4 units.
