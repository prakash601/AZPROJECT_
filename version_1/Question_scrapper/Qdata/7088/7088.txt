Creatnx, a 7-year-old child, is playing with
7 sticks with lengths
1,2,…,7, which can be connected together. He is trying to use some of them to create a polygon. Trans, his father, is looking, and since he is a programmer, he quickly comes up with a problem based on this game:
There are
N sticks (line segments) with lengths
1,2,3,…,N. You should choose a non-empty subset of these sticks and create a (simple, non-degenerate) polygon by connecting their endpoints together. How many such subsets of sticks can you choose? Since this number could be large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of subsets that can be chosen, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Example case 1: There are four sticks with lengths
1,2,3,4. The only subsets from which we can create a polygon are
{2,3,4} and
{1,2,3,4}. On the other hand, we cannot choose e.g.
{1,2,3} because degenerate polygons are not allowed.
