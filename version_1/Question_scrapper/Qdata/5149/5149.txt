Chef is given two binary strings
A and
B, each having length
N.
Chef wants to find the number of binary strings
C, of length
N, such that
H(A,C)=H(B,C), where
H(X,Y) denotes the hamming distance between the strings
X and
Y.
Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Note: Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the length of the strings.
The second line contains the binary string
A.
The third line contains the binary string
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a new line, the number of binary strings
C which satisfy the given conditions modulo
10
9
+7.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤2⋅10
5
A and
B consist of
0 and
1 only.
Sum of
N over all test cases do not exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: The number of strings
C, of length
2, such that
H(A,C)=H(B,C) is
2. The strings are:
C=10: Here,
H(11,10)=H(00,10)=1, as there is only one position where the corresponding characters are different.
C=01: Here,
H(11,01)=H(00,01)=1.
Test case
3: The number of strings
C, of length
3, such that
H(A,C)=H(B,C) is
4. The strings are:
C=000: Here,
H(101,000)=H(011,000)=2, as there are two positions where the corresponding characters are different.
C=111: Here,
H(101,111)=H(011,111)=1, as there is only one position where the corresponding characters are different.
C=001: Here,
H(101,001)=H(011,001)=1, as there is only one position where the corresponding characters are different.
C=110: Here,
H(101,110)=H(011,110)=2, as there are two positions where the corresponding characters are different.
