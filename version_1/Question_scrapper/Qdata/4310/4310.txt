Chef has a string
A (containing lowercase Latin letters only) of length
N where
N is even. He can perform the following operation any number of times:
Swap
A
i
and
A
i+2
for any
1≤i≤(N−2)
Determine if Chef can convert string
A to a palindromic string.
Note: A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards. For example,
noon and
level are palindromic strings but
ebb is not.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of the string
A.
The second line of each test case contains a string
A of length
N containing lowercase Latin letters only.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can convert the string
A to a palindromic string. Otherwise, output NO.
You may print each character of YES and NO in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
Constraints
1≤T≤200
1≤N≤1000
S contains lowercase Latin letters only.
N is even

Explanation:
Test case
1: The given string is already a palindrome.
Test case
2: It can be proven that is it not possible to convert
A to a palindromic string.
Test case
3: We can perform the following operations:
Swap
A
1
and
A
3
. (Now
A becomes xzzyyx)
Swap
A
2
and
A
4
. (Now
A becomes xyzzyx)
