Oh, these difficult contests... In each contest, there are so many hard tasks Chef cannot solve. However, he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard. Fortunately, he has a problem in mind for training.
You are given two positive integers
a and
b. You may apply the following magical operation any number of times (including zero):
choose an arbitrary positive integer
d
perform exactly one of the following actions:
add
d to
a, add
d−1 to
b
add
d−1 to
a, add
d to
b
Chef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain
a=b. Help him!
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
a and
b.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain
a=b or "NO" if it is impossible.

YES
Explanation:
Example case 1: One possible strategy for Chef is:
choose
d=10, add
d−1=9 to
a and
d=10 to
b; after this operation,
a=14 and
b=17
choose
d=10, add
d=10 to
a and
d−1=9 to
b; afterwards,
a=24 and
b=26
choose
d=9, add
d=9 to
a and
d−1=8 to
b; afterwards,
a=33 and
b=34
choose
d=9, add
d to
a and
d−1 to
b; finally, we have
a=b=42
