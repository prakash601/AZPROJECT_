Chef loves bitwise operations. So, he creates the following problem but needs your help to solve it.
Chef calls a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
tasty if it satisfies the following condition:
parity(A
i
&A
i+1
)

=parity(A
i
∣A
i+1
) for
1≤i<N.
Chef gives you a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You may perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly
0):
Choose
2 indices
i and
j (
1≤i,j≤n ;
i

=j) and change
A
i
to
A
i
⊕A
j
.
Chef is asking you to make the sequence tasty using the minimum number of operations, or report that it is impossible.
As a friendly reminder,
parity(x) denotes the remainder of dividing
x by
2
& denotes the bitwise AND operation
∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case:
If it is impossible to convert the given sequence into a tasty sequence using the given operations, print a single line containing the integer
−1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer
M ― the minimum number of operations you have to perform.
Then, print
M lines describing these operations in the order in which you want to perform them. For each
k (
1≤k≤M), the
k-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers
i and
j (
1≤i,j≤n ;
i

=j) ― the indices on which the
k-th operation is performed.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

Explanation:
Test case
1: It is impossible to make
A tasty using the given operations.
Test case
2: We can choose
i=1 and
j=3 and apply the operation which converts
A into
[67,16,69] which is tasty.
