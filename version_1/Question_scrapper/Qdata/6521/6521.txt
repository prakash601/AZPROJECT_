Given a tree T consisting of N nodes and Q queries on it. Each node v have some value Cv assigned to it. The queries can be of two types:
1 u v - find number of distinct numbers on path between u and v
2 v y - assign the value y to the node with index v.

All the indices in the queries are 1-based.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in T, and the number of queries to be executed.
The second line of input contains N integers denoting the assigned values C to T.
Each of the next N - 1 lines contains two integersu and v nodes which connected by edge.
Each of the next Q lines contains one query. All the numbers in input are integers.
Output
For each query of type 1, output the answer to the query in a single line.
Constraints
