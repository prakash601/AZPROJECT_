Given a number N. The task is to complete the function convertFive() which replaces all zeros in the number with 5 and returns the number.
Example:
Input
2
1004
121

Output
1554
121

Explanation:
Testcase 1: At index 1 and 2 there is 0 so we replace it with 5.
Testcase 2: There is no,0 so output will remain the same.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number.
Output:
The function will return an integer where all zero's are converted to 5.
Your Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function convertFive().
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 104
