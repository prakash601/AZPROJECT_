Given a sequence
A of length
N, the weight of this sequence is defined as
weight(A)=∑
i=1
N
i⋅A
i
Given an integer
N, we pick a permutation
A of
[1,2…N] uniformly at random. What is the expected weight of this permutation?
It can be shown that the answer can be represented as
Q
P
where
P and
Q are coprime integers and
Q

=0(mod998244353). Print the value of
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998244353.
Input Format
First line of the input contains
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer on a single line
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer, the answer to the test case.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one permutation of
[1] which is
[1] and the weight of this permutation is equal to
1. So, the expected weight is equal to
1.
Test case
2: There are
2 permutations of
[1,2] namely
[1,2] with weight equal to
5.
[2,1] with weight equal to
4.
So, the expected weight is equal to
2!
5+4
=

Test case
3: There are
6 permutations of
[1,2,3] namely
[1,2,3] with weight equal to
14.
[1,3,2] with weight equal to
13.
[2,1,3] with weight equal to
13.
[2,3,1] with weight equal to
11.
[3,1,2] with weight equal to
11.
[3,2,1] with weight equal to
10.
So, the expected weight is equal to
3!
14+13+13+11+11+10
=12.
