You are given an array
A of
N integers, initially all zero.
There are
Q types of operations that you are allowed to perform. Each operation is described by two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(1≤l
i
≤r
i
≤N) and is as follows:
Set
A
j
=A
j
⊕1 for each
j such that
l
i
≤j≤r
i
.
Here
⊕ represents the Bitwise XOR operator.
Your task is to find the number of distinct arrays which can be obtained by applying some subset of these operations (possibly none, possibly all). Since the answer may be huge, output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line contains two integers
N and
Q — the size of the array
A and the number of types of operations you can perform.
The
i-th of the next
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
l
i
and
r
i
— corresponding to the
i-th query.
Output Format
Output in single line, the number of distinct arrays which can be obtained by applying some subset of these operations, modulo
998244353.
