In Homer's country, there are
n
cities numbered
1
to
n
and they form a tree. That is, there are
(n−1)
undirected roads between these
n
cities and every two cities can reach each other through these roads.
Homer's country is an industrial country, and each of the
n
cities in it contains some mineral resource. The mineral resource of city
i
is labeled
ai
.
Homer is given the plans of the country in the following
q
years. The plan of the
i
-th year is described by four parameters
ui,vi,li
and
ri
, and he is asked to find any mineral resource
ci
such that the following two conditions hold:
mineral resource
ci
appears an odd number of times between city
ui
and city
vi
; and
li≤ci≤ri
.
As the best friend of Homer, he asks you for help. For every plan, find any such mineral resource
ci
, or tell him that there doesn't exist one.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅105
) and
q
(
1≤q≤3⋅105
), indicating the number of cities and the number of plans.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
).
Then the
i
-th line of the following
(n−1)
lines contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤n
) with
xi≠yi
, indicating that there is a bidirectional road between city
xi
and city
yi
. It is guaranteed that the given roads form a tree.
Then the
i
-th line of the following
q
lines contains four integers
ui
,
vi
,
li
,
ri
(
1≤ui≤n
,
1≤vi≤n
,
1≤li≤ri≤n
), indicating the plan of the
i
-th year.
Output
Print
q
lines, the
i
-th of which contains an integer
ci
such that
ci=−1
if there is no such mineral resource that meets the required condition; or
ci
is the label of the chosen mineral resource of the
i
-th year. The chosen mineral resource
ci
should meet those conditions in the
i
-th year described above in the problem statement. If there are multiple choices of
ci
, you can print any of them.

Note
In the first three queries, there are four cities between city
3
and city
5
, which are city
1
, city
2
, city
3
and city
5
. The mineral resources appear in them are mineral resources
1
(appears in city
3
and city
5
),
2
(appears in city
2
) and
3
(appears in city
1
). It is noted that
The first query is only to check whether mineral source
1
appears an odd number of times between city
3
and city
5
. The answer is no, because mineral source
1
appears twice (an even number of times) between city
3
and city
5
.
The second and the third queries are the same but they can choose different mineral resources. Both mineral resources
2
and
3
are available.
