You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.
There are
N submissions, numbered
1 through
N. For each valid
i, the
i-th submission was submitted at time
S
i
and judged at time
J
i
(in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than
5 minutes.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
S
i
and
J
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The delays of the respective submissions are
2 minutes,
0 minutes,
6 minutes,
10 minutes and
5 minutes. Only submissions
3 and
4 are delayed by more than
5 minutes, hence the answer is
2.
