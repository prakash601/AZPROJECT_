It is Chef's birthday. You know that Chef's favourite number is
X. You also know that Chef loves averages. Therefore you decide it's best to gift Chef
3 integers
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
, such that:
The mean of
A
1
,A
2
and
A
3
is
X.
1≤A
1
,A
2
,A
3
≤1000.
A
1
,A
2
and
A
3
are distinct.
Output any suitable
A
1
,A
2
and
A
3
which you could gift to Chef.
As a reminder, the mean of three numbers
P,Q,R is defined as:
mean(P,Q,R)=
3
P+Q+R
.
For example,
mean(2,3,5)=
3
2+3+5
=

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer
X — Chef's favourite number.
Output Format
For each test case, one line containing
3 space-separated integers —
A
1
,A
2
, and
A
3
, which satisfy the given conditions. If there are multiple possible answers you may output any of them.
It can be shown that an answer always exists, under the given constraints.
