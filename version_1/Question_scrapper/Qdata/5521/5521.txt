You are given an array
A of size
N and an integer
X.
Find the count of all the pairs
(i,j) such that
((A
i
⊕A
j
)
&
X)=0. Here
⊕ and
& denote bitwise XOR and bitwise AND operations respectively..
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N - the size of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
10 pairs of
(i,j)
(1≤i,j≤N) satisfying the condition. These pairs are:
(1,1),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(3,1),(3,3),(3,4),(4,1),(4,3), and
(4,4).
Test case
2: There are
9 pairs of
(i,j)
(1≤i,j≤N) satisfying the condition. These pairs are:
(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2), and
(3,3).
