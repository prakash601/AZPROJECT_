Consider
N binary variables
x
1
,x
2
,…,x
N
. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these variables can be
x
i
=0 or
x
i
=1; therefore, there are
2
N
possible assignments of values to the variables. For each valid
i, setting
x
i
=1 gives you score
g
i
.
In addition, there are
M special intervals (numbered
1 through
M). For each valid
i, the
i-th interval is
[u
i
,v
i
] and if
x
u
i
=x
u
i
+1
=…=x
v
i
=1, then your score increases by
d
i
.
Note that both
g
i
and
d
i
can be negative (setting more variables to
1 can decrease your score), and your score can also be negative. Formally, the score of an assignment of values to the binary variables is
∑
i=1
N
g
i
⋅x
i
+∑
i=1
M
d
i
⋅∏
j=u
i
v
i
x
j
.
Find the
K highest scores among all assignments on these variables. Formally, if we computed the scores of all
2
N
assignments and sorted them in non-increasing order, you should find the first
K of these values.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
g
1
,g
2
,…,g
N
.
M lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers
u
i
,
v
i
and
d
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
K space-separated integers ― the
K highest scores of assignments on the binary variables, in decreasing order.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The best assignment is
x=(0,0,1,1), with score
7. The second and third best assignments are
(0,0,1,0) and
(0,1,1,1), each with score
5.
