You are given a positive integer
N.
Find the number of triples
(X,Y,Z) such that:
0<X,Y,Z<N;
X+Y+Z=N;
X
∣
Y
∣
Z=N, where
∣ represents the bitwise OR operation.
Since the number of triples can be huge, print them modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer
N, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of triples satisfying the condition, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are no triples
(X,Y,Z) satisfying the given conditions.
Test case
2: The following
6 tuples satisfy the conditions:
{(1,2,4),(1,4,2),(2,1,4),(2,4,1),(4,1,2),(4,2,1)}.
For example, in the tuple
(1,2,4),
1+2+4=7 and
