N points are given on the coordinate system such that the coordinates of the
i
th
point are
(X
i
,Y
i
) and
X
i
<X
i+1
for all
(1≤i<N).
Maintain two types of queries:
Type
1: You are given
5 integers in the form: 1 L R K B. For all
L≤i≤R, change the coordinates of the
i
th
point to
(X
i
,K⋅X
i
+B).
Type
2: You are given
3 integers in the form: 2 L R. Find whether the
L
th
,(L+1)
th
,…,R
th
points are collinear (lie on the same straight line).
Input Format
The first line of input contains two integers
N and
M, which represent the number of points and the number of operations.
The next
lines, each line contains two space-separated integers:
i
i
, the coordinates of the
i
th
point.
The next
M lines, each line contains a query in the above discussed format.
Output Format
For each query of type
2, if points are collinear, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Explanation:
Query
1: A single point is considered collinear.
Query
2: Coordinates
(0,0) and
(2,2) lie on the same line, i.e.
y=x.
Query
3: The three points do not lie on the same line.
Query
4: We change the third point from
(3,4) to
(3,1⋅3+0)=(3,3). Similarly fourth point is changed from
(5,4) to
(5,5⋅1+0)=(5,5).
Query
5: The first five points lie on the same straight line, i.e.
y=x.
Query
6: We change the fourth point from
(5,5) to
(5,5⋅(−1)+12)=(5,7).
Query
7: The last three points lie on the same straight line, i.e.
y=−x+12.
