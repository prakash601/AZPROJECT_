There is a checkered field with
10
5
rows (numbered
1 through
10
5
) and
10
5
columns (numbered
1 through
10
5
).
N different cells in this field (numbered
1 through
N) are marked; for each valid
i, the coordinates of the
i-th marked cell are
(x
i
,y
i
).
A set of cells is suitable if it meets the following conditions:
All marked cells belong to this set.
For any two cells
a and
b belonging to this set, there is a path between them with length
∣x
a
−x
b
∣+∣y
a
−y
b
∣ which only visits cells in this set. Each pair of consecutive cells in a path must have a common side.
You need to find the smallest possible size of a suitable set of cells, as well as the number of sets with this smallest size. Since the number of sets may be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
T.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
.
Output
If
T=0, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest size of a suitable set.
If
T=1, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the smallest size of a suitable set and the number of sets with this size modulo
10

+7.
