Chef is playing a video game, and is now fighting the final boss.
The boss has
H health points. Each attack of Chef reduces the health of the boss by
X.
Chef also has a special attack that can be used at most once, and will decrease the health of the boss by
Y.
Chef wins when the health of the boss is
≤0.
What is the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case will contain three space-separated integers
H,X,Y — the parameters described in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤X<Y≤H≤100

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can attack the boss
4 times normally. This results in
25+25+25+25=100 damage, which is enough to defeat the boss.
Test case
2: Chef can attack the boss
2 times normally, then use the special attack. This results in
29+29+45=103 damage, which is enough to defeat the boss.
Test case
3: Chef can proceed as follows:
First, use the special attack. This leaves the boss with
46−2=44 health.
Then, use
44 normal attacks to defeat the boss, since each one does
1 damage.
This takes a total of
44+1=45 attacks.
Test case
4: Chef can use the special attack to immediately bring the health of the boss to zero, hence only needing one attack.
