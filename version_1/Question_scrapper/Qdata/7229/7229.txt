You are given two integers
N and
M. You have to construct a matrix with
N rows and
M columns. Consider a multiset
S which contains
N+M integers: for each row and each column of this matrix, the MEX of the elements of this row/column belongs to
S. Then, in the matrix you construct, the MEX of
S must be maximum possible.
Note: The MEX of a multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in this multiset. For example,
MEX({4,9,0,1,1,5})=2 and
MEX({1,2,3})=0.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
Output
For each test case, print
N lines. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines should contain
M space-separated integers ― the elements in the
i-th row of your matrix. Each element of the matrix must be non-negative and must not exceed
10
9
.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤400
1≤N,M≤100
the sum of
N⋅M over all test cases does not exceed
10

Example Output
9 1 0
1 0 2
7 5 8

3 0

0 1
Explanation
Example case 1: The MEXs of the rows
{9,1,0},
{1,0,2} and
{7,5,8} are
2,
3 and
0 respectively. The MEXs of the columns
{9,1,7},
{1,0,5} and
{0,2,8} are
0,
2 and
1 respectively. Therefore, the multiset which contains the MEX of each row and each column is
S={0,0,1,2,2,3} and
MEX(S)=4. We can show that this is the largest MEX that can be obtained for a
3×3 matrix.
