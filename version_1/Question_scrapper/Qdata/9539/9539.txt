There is a deck of
n
cards. The
i
-th card has a number
ai
on the front and a number
bi
on the back. Every integer between
1
and
2n
appears exactly once on the cards.
A deck is called sorted if the front values are in increasing order and the back values are in decreasing order. That is, if
ai<ai+1
and
bi>bi+1
for all
1≤i<n
.
To flip a card
i
means swapping the values of
ai
and
bi
. You must flip some subset of cards (possibly, none), then put all the cards in any order you like. What is the minimum number of cards you must flip in order to sort the deck?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of cards.
The next
n
lines describe the cards. The
i
-th of these lines contains two integers
ai,bi
(
1≤ai,bi≤2n
). Every integer between
1
and
2n
appears exactly once.
Output
If it is impossible to sort the deck, output "-1". Otherwise, output the minimum number of flips required to sort the deck.

Note
In the first test case, we flip the cards
(1,9)
and
(2,7)
. The deck is then ordered
(3,10),(5,8),(6,4),(7,2),(9,1)
. It is sorted because
3<5<6<7<9
and
10>8>4>2>1
.
In the second test case, it is impossible to sort the deck.
