There is a bus with 30 seats. The seats are numbered from 1 to 30, and the numbering is as depicted in this image.
As can be seen in the image, the bus is divided into two decks - The Lower deck, and the Upper deck, with 15 seats each. And some of the seats come as Single and some as Double. For example, Seats 1 and 2 are Double, whereas Seat 11 is a Single.
You will be given a Seat number, and your job is to classify it as one of these 4 types:
Lower Single
Lower Double
Upper Single
Upper Double
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input which contains a single integers
N — the seat number.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the type of seat.

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The seat number 6 is in the Lower deck, and it is a Double. Hence the output is "Lower Double".
Testcase 2: The seat number 28 is in the Upper deck, and it is a Single. Hence the output is "Upper Single".
Testcase 3: The seat number 16 is in the Upper deck, and it is a Double. Hence the output is "Upper Double".
Testcase 4: The seat number 13 is in the Lower deck, and it is a Single. Hence the output is "Lower Single".
Testcase 5: The seat number 10 is in the Lower deck, and it is a Double. Hence the output is "Lower Double".
