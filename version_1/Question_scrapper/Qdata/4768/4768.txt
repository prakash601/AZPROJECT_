Vanja and Miksi have already finished everything for this year at their university, so they decided to spend their free time playing a game with a binary sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
(i.e. a sequence containing only integers
0 and
1).
At the beginning of the game, Vanja and Miksi write down the expression
∗A
1
∗A
2
∗A
3
∗…∗A
N
(note below that each
∗ is a placeholder and does not denote multiplication).
The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja. The game lasts
N turns. In each turn, the current player must replace the first (leftmost) remaining
∗ by the sign
+ or
− (or, equivalently, by the operation of addition or subtraction).
After the last turn, the boys calculate the resulting value
V of the expression. If
∣V∣≥K, the winner is Vanja; otherwise, the winner is Miksi.
Please predict the winner of the game if both players play optimally.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer —
1 if Vanja (the first player) is the winner or
2 if Miksi (the second player) is the winner.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
K=1, so if Vanja replaces the first
∗ by
+, the value of the final expression will be
V=1; then,
K≤∣V∣, so the winner is Vanja.
Example case 2:
K=5, but the absolute value of the final expression cannot be greater than
1. The winner is Miksi.
