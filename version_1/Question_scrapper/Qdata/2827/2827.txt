This problem is to implement disjoint set union. There will be 2 incomplete functions namely union and find. You have to complete these functions. 
Union: Join two subsets into a single set.
isConnected: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in same subset.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
q = 4
Queries = 
Union(1,3)
isConnected(1,2)
Union(1,5)
isConnected(3,5)
Output:
0
1
Explanation: Initially all nodes 1 2 3 4 5
are not connected. 
After Union(1,3), node 1 and 3 will be
connected.
When we do isConnected(1,2),  as node 1
and 2 are not connected it will return 0.
After Union(1,5), node 1 and 5 will be
connected.
When we do isConnected(3,5),  as node
1 and 3 are connected, and node 1 and 5
are connected, hence 3 and 5 are
connected. Thus it will return 1.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
q = 4
Queries = 
Union(1,4)
Union(1,5)
isConnected(2,3)
Union(3,4)
Output: 0
Your Task:
You have to complete the function union_() which merges the node1 and node2. You will also have to complete the function isConnected() which will return whether the two nodes are connected.
Note: Both function will contain two arrays par[] and ranks1[] along with two nodes. Initially par[i] = i and rank1[i] = 1 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N + Q).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints: 
1 <= N <= 105
1<= Q <= 105
1 <= node1, node2 <= N
