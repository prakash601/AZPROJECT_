You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers.
You have to perform the sequence of
n−2
operations on this array:
during the first operation, you either add
a2
to
a1
and subtract
a2
from
a3
, or add
a2
to
a3
and subtract
a2
from
a1
;
during the second operation, you either add
a3
to
a2
and subtract
a3
from
a4
, or add
a3
to
a4
and subtract
a3
from
a2
;
...
during the last operation, you either add
an−1
to
an−2
and subtract
an−1
from
an
, or add
an−1
to
an
and subtract
an−1
from
an−2
.
So, during the
i
-th operation, you add the value of
ai+1
to one of its neighbors, and subtract it from the other neighbor.
For example, if you have the array
[1,2,3,4,5]
, one of the possible sequences of operations is:
subtract
2
from
a3
and add it to
a1
, so the array becomes
[3,2,1,4,5]
;
subtract
1
from
a2
and add it to
a4
, so the array becomes
[3,1,1,5,5]
;
subtract
5
from
a3
and add it to
a5
, so the array becomes
[3,1,−4,5,10]
.
So, the resulting array is
[3,1,−4,5,10]
.
An array is reachable if it can be obtained by performing the aforementioned sequence of operations on
a
. You have to calculate the number of reachable arrays, and print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤300
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤300
).
Output
Print one integer — the number of reachable arrays. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder modulo
998244353
.
