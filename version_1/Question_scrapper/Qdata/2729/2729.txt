Given a 2-d array of integers having N*N elements, print the transpose of the array.
Example 1:
Input : arr[] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, 
  {7,8,9}} and N = 3
Output : 1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9
Explanation:1 2 3 1 4 7
 4 5 6 ----> 2 5 8
 7 8 9 3 6 9
Transpose of array.

Example 2:
Input : arr[ ] = {{1, 2}, {1, 2}} 
  and N = 2 
Output : 1 1 2 2
  Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function transpose() that takes a two-dimension array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), and return the transpose of the array. The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
  Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000
