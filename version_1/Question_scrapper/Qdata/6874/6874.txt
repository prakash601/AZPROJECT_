You are given a tree with
N vertices numbered 1 through
N as a sequence of
N−1 edges — pairs
(a
1
,b
1
),(a
2
,b
2
),…,(a
N−1
,b
N−1
). Let's define the value of a sequence
A with length
N−1 as
F(A)=∑
i=1
N−1
A
i
⋅W
i
, where
W
1
,W
2
,…,W
N−1
are given weights.
You may change the order of the pairs and the order of elements within any pairs. Formally, consider a reordering
(P,R) — any permutation
P=(P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N−1
) of the integers
1 through
N−1 and any subset
R of these integers (possibly containing all of them). Let's define two sequences
C=(c
P
1
,c
P
2
,…,c
P
N−1
) and
D=(d
P
1
,d
P
2
,…,d
P
N−1
), where for each valid
i,
c
i
a
i
and
d
i
b
i
if
i
R, or
c
i
b
i
and
d
i
a
i
if
iR. If
D is strictly increasing, the reordering is valid and its value is
F(C).
Find the maximum value of a valid reordering, i.e. the maximum
F(C), and the number of valid reorderings that have this maximum value.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
W
1
,W
2
,…,W
N−1
.
N−1 lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N−1), the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
a
i
and
b
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers — the maximum value of a reordering and the number of reorderings with the maximum value.

Explanation:
Example case 1: There are two valid orderings with value
4:
P=(2,1,3),
R={2,3};
C=(3,1,4) and
D=(1,2,3), so
F(C)=3⋅1+1⋅1+4⋅0=4
P=(2,1,3),
R={2};
C=(3,1,3) and
D=(1,2,4), so
F(C)=3⋅1+1⋅1+3⋅0=4
