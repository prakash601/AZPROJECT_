Chef has an integer
X and wants to find out any triplet
(A,B,C) such that:
1≤A,B,C≤10
6
;
A⋅B+C=X
If no such triplet exists, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer
X, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output the values of
A,B,C such that
1≤A,B,C≤10
6
and
A⋅B+C=X.
If multiple such triplets exist, you may print any.
If no such triplet exists, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: It can be proven that no such triplet exists.
Test case
2: Consider
A=2,B=7, and
C=1, where:
1≤A,B,C≤10
6
A⋅B+C=2⋅7+1=15=X
Test case
3: Consider
A=1,B=1, and
C=1, where:
1≤A,B,C≤10
6
A⋅B+C=1⋅1+1=2=X
