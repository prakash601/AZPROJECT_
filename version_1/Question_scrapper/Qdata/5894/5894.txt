Chef likes to spend his summer vacation playing with strings. Chef likes alternating patterns, but he only likes the characters
a and
b, so he does the following:
Chef starts with an empty string
S. Then,
First, he appends
a once to
S
Next, he appends
b twice to
S
Next, he appends
a thrice to
S
Next, he appends
b four times to
S
and so on. For example, the first
13 characters of
S are
abbaaabbbbaaa.
Now, Chef takes the string formed by the first
N characters of
S, and wants to calculate its beauty. The beauty of a string is calculated as follows:
First, we define the value of a string
A to be the number of positions
1≤i<∣A∣ such that
A
i

=A
i+1
. For example, the value of
aaa is
0 and the value of
abba is
2.
Then, the beauty of a string is defined to be the sum of values of all its substrings. Two substrings are considered distinct if they occur at different positions, so every string of length
K has exactly
K⋅(K+1)/2 substrings.
You are given
N. Help Chef by calculating the beauty of the string formed by the first
N characters of
S. The answer may be large, so report it modulo
1000000007.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the beauty of the string modulo
10

Explanation:
Test case
1: The first three characters of
S are
abb. The values of the substrings are as follows:
a,b,b,bb have a value of
0.
ab,abb have a value of
1.
So, the beauty of the string is
2.
Test case
2: The first
4 characters of
S are
abba. Its substrings of non-zero value are:
ab,abb,ba,bba with value
1
abba with value
2.
So, the beauty of the string is
1+1+1+1+2=6.
