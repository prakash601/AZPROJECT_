After six days, professor GukiZ decided to give more candies to his students. Like last time, he has
N students, numbered
1 through
N. Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the
i-th student by
p
i
. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence
p:
The numbers of candies given to each of the first
K students (
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
K
) are known exactly.
All elements of the sequence
p are distinct and positive.
GukiZ didn't give more than
x candies to any student (the maximum value in the sequence
p is not greater than
x).
For each student
i, there is at least one other student
j such that
∣p
i
−p
j
∣≤D.
The professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e.
S=p
1
+p
2
+p
3
+…+p
N
is maximum possible.
GukiZ would like to know the total number of candies
S he had at the beginning. However, times change and after six days, the professor is really tired, so it is possible that there is no sequence
p which satisfies the constraints. Can you help GukiZ find the number of candies he gave out, or tell him that he must have made a mistake?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
N,
K,
x,
D.
The second line contains
K distinct space-separated integers
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
K
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of candies GukiZ had, or
−1 if there is no valid sequence
p.

Explanation:
Example case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got
p
1
=2 candies, the second student got
p
2
=1 and the third got
p
3
=5 candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is
x=5. The best possible option is giving
p
4
=4 candies to the last student. Then, the fourth constraint (with
D=3) is satisfied for all students. Only the pair of students
(2,3) have numbers of candies that differ by more than
3, but still, for each student, there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies.
Example case 2: GukiZ made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence
p. The answer is
−1.
