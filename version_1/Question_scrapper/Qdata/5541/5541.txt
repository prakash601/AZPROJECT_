JJ has a binary string
S of length
2⋅N. He wants to partition it into
M substrings such that:
1≤M≤2⋅N
Each
S
i
belongs to exactly one partition
None of the partitioned substrings is a palindrome
For example: One of the valid partitions of
10010011 is
100
 10
 011
.
Can you find any partition satisfying the above conditions? If no such partition exists, output
−1.
A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g.
1001 and
00100 are palindromic strings.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — half the length of the binary string
S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S of length
2⋅N containing
0s and
1s only.
Output Format
For each test case,
In the first line, output:
M
(1≤M≤2⋅N) - the number of partitions
In the second line, output
M integers:
L
1
,L
2
,…,L
M
- where
L
i
denotes the length of the
i
th
partitioned substring. (Note that
L
1
+L
2
+⋯+L
M
=2⋅N and
L
i
≥1 for all
i)
Constraints
1≤T≤10
5
1≤N≤10

The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Explained in the problem statement.
Test Case 2: It can be proven that no valid partition of
00 exists.
Test Case 3: One of the valid partitions of
101101 is
10
 1101
