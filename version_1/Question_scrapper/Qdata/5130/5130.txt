You are given positive integers
N and
D. You may perform operations of the following two types:
add
D to
N, i.e. change
N to
N+D
change
N to
digitsum(N)
Here,
digitsum(x) is the sum of decimal digits of
x. For example,
digitsum(123)=1+2+3=6,
digitsum(100)=1+0+0=1,
digitsum(365)=3+6+5=14.
You may perform any number of operations (including zero) in any order. Please find the minimum obtainable value of
N and the minimum number of operations required to obtain this value.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
D.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers — the minimum value of
N and the minimum required number of operations.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The value
N=1 can be achieved by 8 successive "add" operations (changing
N to
10) and one "digit-sum" operation.
Example case 2: You can prove that you cannot obtain
N=1 and
N=2, and you can obtain
N=3. The value
N=3 can be achieved by one "add" and one "digitsum" operation, changing
9 to
12 and
12 to
3.
Example case 3:
N=1 can be achieved by operations "add", "add", "digitsum", "digitsum":
11→24→37→10→1.
