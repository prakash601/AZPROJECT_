Your friend works as a valet where
N cars show up in a shift. The
i-th car will arrive
T
i
seconds after the current moment, and the car can wait for at most
Y
i
seconds. That is, your friend can only start parking the car from time
T
i
to
T
i
+Y
i
(inclusive).
Additionally, it takes
X
i
time to park the
i-th car, which means he cannot park any other cars for
X
i
seconds starting from the time he starts parking the
i-th car. It is known that no driver would like to wait for more time than it takes to park his car, so that
Y
i
<X
i
for all
i. The driver of the
i-th car will pay
A
i
coins as a tip to your friend if his car is parked. Note that he can start parking the next car immediately after he finishes parking the previous car.
Your friend has asked you what will be the maximize possible earnings if he optimally chooses which cars to park and at what times.

Explanation:
It is optimal to start parking the first car at
5 seconds. We finish parking at
8 seconds, and immediately start parking the second car.
