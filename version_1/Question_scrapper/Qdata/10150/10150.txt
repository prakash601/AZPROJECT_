There are
n
warriors in a row. The power of the
i
-th warrior is
ai
. All powers are pairwise distinct.
You have two types of spells which you may cast:
Fireball: you spend
x
mana and destroy exactly
k
consecutive warriors;
Berserk: you spend
y
mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power.
For example, let the powers of warriors be
[2,3,7,8,11,5,4]
, and
k=3
. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers
8
and
11
, the resulting sequence of powers becomes
[2,3,7,11,5,4]
. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers
[7,11,5]
, the resulting sequence of powers becomes
[2,3,4]
.
You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers
a1,a2,…,an
into
b1,b2,…,bm
. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅105
) — the length of sequence
a
and the length of sequence
b
respectively.
The second line contains three integers
x,k,y
(
1≤x,y,≤109;1≤k≤n
) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.
The third line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
). It is guaranteed that all integers
ai
are pairwise distinct.
The fourth line contains
m
integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
1≤bi≤n
). It is guaranteed that all integers
bi
are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce
a1,a2,…,an
into
b1,b2,…,bm
, or
−1
if it is impossible.
