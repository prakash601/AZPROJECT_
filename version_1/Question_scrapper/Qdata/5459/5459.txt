There are
N circles in a plane. Circle
i and circle
j form a good pair if it is possible to choose a point
P
1
on the perimeter of circle
i and a point
P
2
on the perimeter of circle
j such that the Euclidean distance between
P
1
and
P
2
is exactly
K. (Note that
P
1
and
P
2
do not need to have integer coordinates.)
You should answer
Q queries. In each query, you are given the required distance
K. Chef is interested in finding the number of good pairs of distinct circles for each query. Please help him.
Note: Circle
i and circle
j are distinct when
i

=j. There may be any number of circles that coincide (have identical centers and radii).
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q denoting the number of circles and the number of queries respectively.
Each of the following
N lines contains three space-separated integers
X,
Y and
R describing a circle with radius
R and center
(X,Y).
Each of the next
Q lines contains one integer
K describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good pairs of circles.

Explanation:
The distance between the point
(0.00,−5.00) on circle
1 and the point
(8.00,1.00) on circle
2 is
10. There is no pair of points on these two circles with distance
0 or
20.
