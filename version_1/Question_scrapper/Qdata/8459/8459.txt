A triple of points
i
,
j
and
k
on a coordinate line is called beautiful if
i<j<k
and
k−i≤d
.
You are given a set of points on a coordinate line, initially empty. You have to process queries of three types:
add a point;
remove a point;
calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set.
Input
The first line contains two integers
q
and
d
(
1≤q,d≤2⋅105
) — the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively.
The second line contains
q
integers
a1,a2,…,aq
(
1≤ai≤2⋅105
) denoting the queries. The integer
ai
denotes the
i
-th query in the following way:
if the point
ai
belongs to the set, remove it; otherwise, add it;
after adding or removing the point, print the number of beautiful triples.
Output
For each query, print one integer — the number of beautiful triples after processing the respective query.
