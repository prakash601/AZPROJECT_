Nazik gave Batman a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.
Initially, Batman is in a vertex
s and his power is equal to
p. During each of the next
M seconds, the following process happens:
A robber with power
r runs from a vertex
x straight to vertex
y.
Batman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).
Batman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.
Let's denote Batman's current vertex by
s (
s=s
i
initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex
g such that each vertex on the simple path between
x and
y (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between
s and
g (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex
g so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.
If Batman catches the robber,
g becomes his current vertex.
After Batman catches this robber, his power increases by
t.
Your task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after
M seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
s
i
and
p.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting an edge in the tree between vertices
u and
v.
The next line contains a single integer
M.
Each of the following
M lines contains four integers
x,
y,
r and
t describing a robber.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible value of Batman's power after
M seconds.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
In the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex
s=1 to vertex
g=5.
In the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex
s=5 to vertex
g=6.
Batman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.
