This is an interactive problem.
You are given a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N). Each vertex has a value; let's denote the value of vertex
i by
a
i
. Vertex
v is a bad adjacent of vertex
u if there is an edge between vertices
u and
v and
a
v
is strictly greater than
a
u
.
Your task is to find a vertex without any bad adjacent or determine that there is no such vertex. You do not know the values
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
, but you may ask up to
20 questions.
In each question, you should choose a vertex
x; the grader responds with the number of some bad adjacent vertex of vertex
x or with
−1 if
x does not have any bad adjacent.
Interaction
First, you should read a line containing a single integer — the number of test cases
T. The description of interaction for
T test cases follows.
For each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer
N.
Then, you should read
N−1 lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that vertices
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Then, you may ask questions.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers
1 and
x (
1≤x≤N).
Then, you should read a line containing a single integer
y.
If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions,
y=−2. If
x has no bad adjacent,
y=−1. Otherwise,
y is the number of a bad adjacent of
x.
When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers
2 and
x. If there is no vertex without a bad adjacent,
x should be
−1; otherwise,
x should be the number of a vertex without a bad adjacent.
Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer:
1 if your answer is correct or
−2 if it is incorrect. If your answer is correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.
Note that when you receive
−2 (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
