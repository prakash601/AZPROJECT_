Chef has a permutation
P of length
N.
Chef wants to find the number of non-empty subsequences of
P which have the same number of inversions as
P.
Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
998244353.
Note:
A permutation of length
N contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
The number of inversions in an array
X is the number of pairs
(i,j) such that
1≤i<j≤N and
X
i
>X
j
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers denoting the permutation
P.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of non-empty subsequences of
P which have same number of inversions as
P, modulo
998244353.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are no inversions in the given permutation. All
2
5
−1=31 subsequences of the given permutation have
0 inversions.
Test case
2: The number of inversions in the given permutation is
3. The subsequences with
3 inversions are
[3,1,2,4,6,5] and
[3,1,2,6,5].
