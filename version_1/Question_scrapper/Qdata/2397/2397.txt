Given a string S and two integers L and R. Print the characters in the range L to R of the string.
NOTE: Assume zero based indexing.

Example 1:
Input: 
S = "cdbkdub"
L = 0 , R = 5
Output: "cdbkdu" 
Explanation: Starting from index 0 ('c')
to index 5 ('u').
Example 2:
Input: 
S = "sdiblcsdbud"
L = 3 , R = 7
"blcsd"
: Starting from index 3 ('b')
to index 7 ('d').

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function javaSub() which takes S, L, R as input parameter and returns the sting from the range L to R.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

Constraints:
1<= |S| <=1000
1 <= L <= 800
1 <= R <= 900
