Let's define the strength of a matrix as the number of distinct rows in it. Two rows
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
n
and
b
1
,b
2
,…,b
n
are distinct if there is an index
i such that
a

=b
i
.
You are given an integer matrix
A with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
M columns (numbered
1 through
M). A submatrix of
A is formed as the intersection of rows
r
1
through
r
2
and columns
c
1
through
c
2
for any
r

. Find the sum of the strengths of all submatrices of
A.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
and
.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the sum of strengths of all the submatrices.
