Chef John is given
N points
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
in a plane. For each valid
i, the coordinates of the point
P
i
are
(x
i
,y
i
). Help him find a vector
v
=(x
v
,y
v
) such that the following holds:
For each
i (
1≤i≤N), let
S
i
=
v
⋅
P
i
P
i+1
. Here, we define
P
N+1
=P

.
The coordinates
x
v
and
y
v
are integers and
∣x
v

v
∣≤2⋅10

.
It is possible to find three integers
w,
l and
r (
1≤l≤r≤N) such that:
For each
i (
l≤i≤r),
S
i
w>0.
For each other valid
i,
S
i
w<0.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. If there are no solutions, let's define
x
v
=y
v
=0. (Note that the vector
v
=(0,0) cannot be a valid solution.)
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers
x
v
and
y
v
.
