You are given N red points and M blue points on a 2D plane.
You are required to delete the minimum number of points(the deleted points can be of both colors) so that it's possible to draw a line such that all remaining red points are on one side of the line while all remaining blue points are on the other side of the line.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
Each of the next N lines contains two integers Xri, Yri describing the coordinates of the i-th red point.
Each of the next M lines contains two integers Xbi, Ybi describing the coordinates of the i-th blue point.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer denoting the minimum number of points to be deleted.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1,000
1 ≤ sum of N in all test cases ≤ 1,000
1 ≤ sum of M in all test cases ≤ 1,000
-109 ≤ Xri, Yri, Xbi, Ybi ≤ 109
No two points among both red and blue points have same coordinates
No three points among both red and blue points are collinear
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): 1 ≤ sum of N in all test-cases, sum of M in all test-cases ≤ 100
