Chef has an array
A of length
N.
Let
F(A) denote the maximum frequency of any element present in the array.
For example:
If
A=[1,2,3,2,2,1], then
F(A)=3 since element
2 has the highest frequency
=3.
If
A=[1,2,3,3,2,1], then
F(A)=2 since highest frequency of any element is
2.
Chef can perform the following operation at most once:
Choose any subsequence
S of the array such that every element of
S is the same, say
x. Then, choose an integer
y and replace every element in this subsequence with
y.
For example, let
A=[1,2,2,1,2,2]. A few examples of the operation that Chef can perform are:
[1,2,2,1,2,2]→[1,5,5,1,2,2]
[1,2,2,1,2,2]→[1,19,2,1,19,19]
[1,2,2,1,2,2]→[2,2,2,1,2,2]
Determine the minimum possible value of
F(A) Chef can get by performing the given operation at most once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the length of array
A.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum value of
F(A) Chef can get if he performs the operation optimally.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef cannot reduce the value of
F(A) by performing any operation.
Test case
2: Chef can perform the operation
[1,1,1,1,1]→[2,1,2,1,2]. The value of
F(A) in this case is
3, which is the minimum possible.
Test case
3: Chef can perform the operation
[1,2,2,1,2,2]→[1,5,5,1,2,2]. The value of
F(A) in this case is
2, which is the minimum possible.
