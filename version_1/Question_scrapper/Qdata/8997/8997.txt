On an endless checkered sheet of paper,
n
cells are chosen and colored in three colors, where
n
is divisible by
3
. It turns out that there are exactly
n
3
marked cells of each of three colors!
Find the largest such
k
that it's possible to choose
k
3
cells of each color, remove all other marked cells, and then select three rectangles with sides parallel to the grid lines so that the following conditions hold:
No two rectangles can intersect (but they can share a part of the boundary). In other words, the area of intersection of any two of these rectangles must be
0
.
The
i
-th rectangle contains all the chosen cells of the
i
-th color and no chosen cells of other colors, for
i=1,2,3
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
n
— the number of the marked cells (
3≤n≤105
,
n
is divisible by 3).
The
i
-th of the following
n
lines contains three integers
xi
,
yi
,
ci
(
|xi|,|yi|≤109
;
1≤ci≤3
), where
(xi,yi)
are the coordinates of the
i
-th marked cell and
ci
is its color.
It's guaranteed that all cells
(xi,yi)
in the input are distinct, and that there are exactly
n
3
cells of each color.
Output
Output a single integer
k
— the largest number of cells you can leave.

Note
In the first sample, it's possible to leave
6
cells with indexes
1,5,6,7,8,9
.
In the second sample, it's possible to leave
3
