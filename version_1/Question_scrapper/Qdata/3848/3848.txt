Chef has two ranges
[A,B] and
[C,D]. Chef needs to find the number of integers that belong to at least one of the ranges.
Note: A range
[P,Q] contains all the integers
{P,P+1,P+2,…,Q−1,Q}.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing
4 integers
A,B,C, and
D, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of integers that belong to at least one of the ranges.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤A≤B≤8
1≤C≤D≤8

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
4 integers that belong to at least one of the ranges. These are
1,2,3, and
5.
Test case
2: There are
7 integers that belong to at least one of the ranges. These are
2,3,4,5,6,7, and
8.
Test case
3: There are
8 integers that belong to at least one of the ranges. These are
1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and
8.
Test case
4: There is only
1 integer that belong to at least one of the ranges. That integer is
5.
