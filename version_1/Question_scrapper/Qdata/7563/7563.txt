Explanation:
In the first test case, one of the possible sequences of operations is the following:
First operation: Choose
x=12, and XOR
A
1
,A
2
and
A
3
with it, obtaining array
[12,8,14,12].
Second operation: Choose
x=3, and XOR
A
1
,A
2
and
A
4
with it, obtaining array
[15,11,14,15], with sum
55.
