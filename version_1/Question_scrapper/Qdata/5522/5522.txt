Alice and Bob are playing a game on a binary string
S of length
N.
Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice going first. On their turn, the current player must choose any index
1≤i<∣S∣ such that
S
i

=S
i+1
and erase either
S
i
or
S
i+1
from the string. This reduces the length of
S by one, and the remaining parts of
S are concatenated in the same order.
The player who is unable to make a move loses.
Determine the winner if both players play optimally.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the length of the string.
The second line contains the binary string
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case output
Alice if Alice wins the game, otherwise output
Bob. The output is not case-sensitive, so for example "Bob", "boB" and "Bob" are all considered equivalent.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤10

S is a binary string
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test Case
1: There is no such index
i such that
S
i

=S
i+1
. So, Alice does not have any move and loses, making Bob the winner.
Test Case
2: Alice can choose
i=2 (because
S
2
=1 and
S
3
=0) and remove
S
3
. After this move, the remaining string is "
11". Bob now has no moves and thus loses.
