Chef is playing a tricky game with a sequence
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
. Initially, his score is
S=1. In the game, he performs the following process exactly
K times (note that the sequence
a never changes):
Pick an element
X from the sequence
a uniformly randomly.
Change the score
S to
(S⋅X)%N.
Find the expected value of Chef's score
S at the end of the game. It can be shown that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction
Q
P
, where
P and
Q are coprime integers,
P≥0,
Q>0 and
Q is coprime with
10
9
+7. You should compute
P⋅Q
−1
%(10
9
+7), where
Q
−1
denotes the multiplicative inverse of
Q modulo
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a
1
,a

,…,a
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Regardless of Chef's exact choices, the final score is always
(1⋅1⋅1)%2=1.
