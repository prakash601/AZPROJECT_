A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.
Input
The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.
