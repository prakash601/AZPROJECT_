Tumut, the best programmer in his village Applidz, invented a problem and decided to share it with you:
You are given two integer sequences
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
N
and
T
1
,T
2
,…,T
M
and an integer
x. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:
choose an element of
S and an element of
T (let's denote them by
S
i
and
T
j
respectively)
decrease both
S
i
and
T
j
by
x, i.e. replace
S
i
by
S
i
−x and
T
j
by
T
j
−x
Let's denote the minimum and maximum value in the sequence
S after performing the chosen operations (possibly none) by
minS and
maxS respectively. Similarly, let's denote the minimum and maximum value in
T after performing the chosen operations by
minT and
maxT respectively. The goal is minimizing the expression
(maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT). Compute the minimum value of this expression.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
x.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

The third line contains

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum possible value of the expression
(maxS+maxT)−(minS+minT).

Explanation:
We can perform these two operations:
decrease
S
2
and
T
1
by
x
decrease
S
2
and
T
2
by
x
Afterwards, the sequence
S will be
[1,2] and the sequence
T will be
[−1,0]. The resulting value of the given expression is
(2+0)−(1+(−1))=2. It is impossible to obtain a smaller value no matter how many operations are performed.
