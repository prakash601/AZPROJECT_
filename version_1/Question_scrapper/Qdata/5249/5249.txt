You are given an integer
N. Find another integer
X(X>N) such that the following conditions are satisfied :
X is not a multiple of
N.
The value
∣gcd(N,X)−lcm(N,X)∣ is as small as possible.
If there are multiple answers for
X, print any.
For reference,
gcd(u,v) is the greatest common divisor between
u and
v, while
lcm(u,v) refers to the least common multiple.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
Output Format
For each testcase, print any suitable
X satisfying the above two conditions for the given
N.
Constraints

Explanation:
1.In first case ,
GCD(3,4) =
1 and
LCM(3,4)=
12 ,
∣1−12∣=
11.
11 is the smallest value we can get by choosing
X as 4.
