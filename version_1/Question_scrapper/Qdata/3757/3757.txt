Alice thinks Bob has very weak math skills.
Alice gave Bob three numbers
A,B, and
C and challenged him to find any positive integer
K strictly less than
100 such that none of the three numbers are divisible by
K.
Help Bob find one such integer
K. Note that there can be multiple correct values for
K, you need to output just one.
Under the given constraints, a valid
K will always exist.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
A,B, and
C.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line any positive integer
K less than
100 that does not divide any of
A,B, or
C.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤A,B,C≤100
