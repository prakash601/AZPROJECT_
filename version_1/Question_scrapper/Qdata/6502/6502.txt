Chef is a painter. He likes to draw geometric figures and among them, he especially loves isosceles right triangles. The longest side of a right triangle is called its hypotenuse. Chef drew
N isosceles right triangles (numbered
1 through
N) on an infinite sheet of paper, which can be represented by a Cartesian half-plane (containing all points
(x,y) such that
y≥0), in such a way that the hypotenuse of each triangle lies on the
x-axis (the line
y=0). For example, the resulting figure could look like this:
The sides of the triangles and the
x-axis split the paper into one or more contiguous regions, which Chef calls . Chef is fascinated by his drawing, so he would like to know how many districts are on his paper. For each valid
i, the hypotenuse of the
i-th triangle is the line segment between points
(l
i
,0) and
(r
i
,0); note that the triangles are uniquely defined by this information.
Help Chef calculate the number of districts in the painting.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
l
i
and
r
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of districts.
