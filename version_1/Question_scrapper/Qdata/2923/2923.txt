A sorted(in ascending order) array A[ ] with distinct elements is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.
Example 1
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 ,5 ,1 ,2 ,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element inthe array.
Example 2
Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 5, 7}
Output: 5
Explanation: Here 5 is the minimum element.
Your Task:
Complete the function findMin() which takes an array arr[] and n, size of the array as input parameters, and returns the minimum element of the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(log N).
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000000
