You are given
n
segments on the coordinate axis. The
i
-th segment is
[li,ri]
. Let's denote the set of all integer points belonging to the
i
-th segment as
Si
.
Let
A∪B
be the union of two sets
A
and
B
,
A∩B
be the intersection of two sets
A
and
B
, and
A⊕B
be the symmetric difference of
A
and
B
(a set which contains all elements of
A
and all elements of
B
, except for the ones that belong to both sets).
Let
[op1,op2,…,opn−1]
be an array where each element is either
∪
,
⊕
, or
∩
. Over all
3n−1
ways to choose this array, calculate the sum of the following values:
|(((S1 op1 S2) op2 S3) op3 S4) … opn−1 Sn|
In this expression,
|S|
denotes the size of the set
S
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤3⋅105
).
Then,
n
lines follow. The
i
-th of them contains two integers
li
and
ri
(
0≤li≤ri≤3⋅105
).
Output
Print one integer — the sum of
|(((S1 op1 S2) op2 S3) op3 S4) … opn−1 Sn|
over all possible ways to choose
[op1,op2,…,opn−1]
. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo
998244353
.
