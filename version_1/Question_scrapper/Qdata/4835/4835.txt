Given an integer
N, find four positive distinct integers
a,
b,
c and
d such that:
1≤a,b,c,d≤10
18
((a&b)∣c)⊕d=N
Here
&,
∣, and
⊕ represent bitwise AND, OR and XOR, respectively.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no answer exists, print
−1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line of input, containing a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output
−1 if there is no way to find four distinct integers to satisfy the equation.
Otherwise, print on a new line any four space-separated integers
a,
b,
c and
d that satisfy the conditions.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
a=1,
b=4,
c=3,
d=2 and
((a&b)∣c)⊕d=(0∣3)⊕2=3⊕2=1.
Test case
2: We have
a=2,
b=4,
c=3,
d=1 and
((a&b)∣c)⊕d=(0∣3)⊕1=3⊕1=2.
Test case
3: Note that the value of
N might exceed the limit of signed a
32-bit integer, use unsigned
32-bit integers or
64-bit integers instead.
