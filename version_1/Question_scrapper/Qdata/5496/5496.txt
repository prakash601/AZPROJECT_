You are given
N distinct points in a
2-D plane, numbered
1 through
N. The X-coordinate of the points are
X
1
,X
2
,…,X
N
respectively and the Y-coordinates are
Y
1
,Y
2
,…,Y
N
respectively. Your goal is to make the location of all the
N points equal to that of each other. To achieve this, you can do some operations.
In one operation, you choose an index
i(1≤i≤N) and a real number
K and change the location of the
i
th
point in one of the following ways:

Find the minimum number of operations to achieve the goal.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer

Explanation:
Test case
1 :
In the first operation, you choose
i=2, and
K=−1 and apply the third type of operation. So the location of
2
nd
point becomes
(1−1,1−1)=(0,0).
In the second operation, you choose
i=3, and
K=4 and apply the first type of operation. So the location of
3
rd
point becomes
(−4+4,5)=(0,5).
In the third operation, you choose
i=3, and
K=−5 and apply the second type of operation. So the location of
3
rd
point becomes
(0,5−5)=(0,0).
Hence after the above operations, the location of the given three points becomes equal to each other.
Test case
2 :
In the first operation, you choose
i=1 and
K=1 and apply the first type of operation. So the location of 1st point becomes
(0+1,1)=(1,1).
In the second operation, you choose
i=3, and
K=−2 and apply the fourth type of operation. So the location of 3rd point becomes
(3−2,−1−(−2))=(1,1).
Hence after the above operations, the location of the given three points becomes equal to each other.
