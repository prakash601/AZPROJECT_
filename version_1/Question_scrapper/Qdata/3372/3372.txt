The hiring team aims to find 3 candidates who are great collectively. Each candidate has his or her ability expressed as an integer. 3 candidates are great collectively if product of their abilities is maximum. Given abilities of N candidates in an array arr[], find the maximum collective ability from the given pool of candidates.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {10, 3, 5, 6, 20}
Output: 1200
Explanation:
Multiplication of 10, 6 and 20 is 1200.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {-10, -3, -5, -6, -20}
Output: -90
Explanation:
Multiplication of -3, -5 and -6 is -90.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxProduct() which takes the array of integers arr[] and n as input parameters and returns the maximum product.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 107
-105 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 105
