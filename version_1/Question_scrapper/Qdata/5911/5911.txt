Chef is given two arrays
A and
B, each having
N elements.
In one move, Chef can choose an index
i
(1≤i≤N−1), get
(A
i
−A
i+1
) points, and then swap
A
i
and
A
i+1
.
For example: If Chef has the array -
[10,7,5] and Chef chooses index
1 during his move, he will get
10−7=3 points and the new array will become
[7,10,5]
Can you help Chef in finding the maximum number of points he can get while converting the array
A into array
B?
Note: It is guaranteed in the input that there exists a sequence of moves which can convert array
A into
B.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the
T testcases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the number of elements in
A and
B.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers
A

The third line of each test case contains

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer, which is the maximum number of points that Chef can get while converting the array
A into array
B

Explanation:
Test Case
1: Chef can choose
i=1 in the first move, get
1−2=−1 points and swap
A
1
and
A
2
. After this move,
A is converted into
B. We can prove that there exists no other sequence of moves which can result in higher score while converting
A into
B.
Test Case
2: One possible sequence of moves is the following:
Choose
i=2. Total points
=1, and
A will become
[3,1,2].
Choose
i=1. Total points
=1+2, and
A will become
[1,3,2].
Choose
i=2. Total points
=1+2+1, and
A will become
[1,2,3].
There are other possible sequences of moves which can result in total
4 points, but no such sequence exists which can result in more than
4 points, and simultaneously convert
A into
B.
