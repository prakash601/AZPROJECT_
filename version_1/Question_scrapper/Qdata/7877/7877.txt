You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
consisting of integers such that
a1+a2+…+an=0
.
You have to rearrange the elements of the array
a
so that the following condition is satisfied:
max
1≤l≤r≤n
|al+al+1+…+ar|<max(a1,a2,…,an)−min(a1,a2,…,an),
where
|x|
denotes the absolute value of
x
.
More formally, determine if there exists a permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
that for the array
ap1,ap2,…,apn
, the condition above is satisfied, and find the corresponding array.
Recall that the array
p1,p2,…,pn
is called a permutation if for each integer
x
from
1
to
n
there is exactly one
i
from
1
to
n
such that
pi=x
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤50000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤300000
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
) — elements of the array
a
. It is guaranteed that the sum of the array
a
is zero, in other words:
a1+a2+…+an=0
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
300000
.
Output
For each test case, if it is impossible to rearrange the elements of the array
a
in the required way, print "No" in a single line.
If possible, print "Yes" in the first line, and then in a separate line
n
numbers — elements
a1,a2,…,an
rearranged in a valid order (
ap1,ap2,…,apn
).
If there are several possible answers, you can output any of them.

Note
In the first test case
max(a1,…,an)−min(a1,…,an)=9
. Therefore, the elements can be rearranged as
[−5,−2,3,4]
. It is easy to see that for such an arrangement
|al+…+ar|
is always not greater than
7
, and therefore less than
9
.
In the second test case you can rearrange the elements of the array as
[−3,2,−3,2,2]
. Then the maximum modulus of the sum will be reached on the subarray
[−3,2,−3]
, and will be equal to
|−3+2+−3|=|−4|=4
, which is less than
5
.
In the fourth test example, any rearrangement of the array
a
will be suitable as an answer, including
[−1,0,1]
.
