One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code.

Fibonacci addition is an operation on an array
X
of integers, parametrized by indices
l
and
r
. Fibonacci addition increases
Xl
by
F1
, increases
Xl+1
by
F2
, and so on up to
Xr
which is increased by
Fr−l+1
.
Fi
denotes the
i
-th Fibonacci number (
F1=1
,
F2=1
,
Fi=Fi−1+Fi−2
for
i>2
), and all operations are performed modulo
MOD
.
You are given two arrays
A
and
B
of the same length. We will ask you to perform several Fibonacci additions on these arrays with different parameters, and after each operation you have to report whether arrays
A
and
B
are equal modulo
MOD
.
Input
The first line contains 3 numbers
n
,
q
and
MOD
(
1≤n,q≤3⋅105,1≤MOD≤109+7
) — the length of the arrays, the number of operations, and the number modulo which all operations are performed.
The second line contains
n
numbers — array
A
(
0≤Ai<MOD
).
The third line also contains
n
numbers — array
B
(
0≤Bi<MOD
).
The next
q
lines contain character
c
and two numbers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) — operation parameters. If
c
is "A", Fibonacci addition is to be performed on array
A
, and if it is is "B", the operation is to be performed on
B
.
Output
After each operation, print "YES" (without quotes) if the arrays are equal and "NO" otherwise. Letter case does not matter.

Note
Explanation of the test from the condition:
Initially
A=[2,2,1]
,
B=[0,0,0]
.
After operation "A 1 3":
A=[0,0,0]
,
B=[0,0,0]
(addition is modulo 3).
After operation "A 1 3":
A=[1,1,2]
,
B=[0,0,0]
.
After operation "B 1 1":
A=[1,1,2]
,
B=[1,0,0]
.
After operation "B 2 2":
A=[1,1,2]
,
B=[1,1,0]
.
After operation "A 3 3":
A=[1,1,0]
,
B=[1,1,0]
.
