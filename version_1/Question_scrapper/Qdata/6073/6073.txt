You are given an array
A consisting of
N integers along with
Q queries.
For each query:
X : Given an integer
X, print and remove the minimum element in the array
k, such that
gcd(X,k)>1, where
gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.
If no value present in the array satisfies the condition, print and remove the minimum element of the array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case consists of a single integer
N — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

query.
Output Format
For each test case, print
Q space-separated integers denoting the answer to each query.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The given array is
[2,9,3,15,10] and there are
4 queries:
Query
1: Given
X=2. The elements
2 and
10 satisfy the condition. Since
2 is smaller, we print and remove
2 from array. The array becomes
A=[9,3,15,10].
Query
2: Given
X=2. The element
10 satisfies the condition. We print and remove
10 from array. The array becomes
A=[9,3,15].
Query
3: Given
X=3. The elements
3 and
9 satisfy the condition. Since
3 is smaller, we print and remove
3 from array. The array becomes
A=[9,15].
Query
4: Given
X=7. No element satisfies the condition, so we have to select
9 since it is the smallest element present. We print and remove
9 from array. The array becomes
A=[15].
