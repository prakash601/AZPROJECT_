You are given a weighted simple undirected graph with
N vertices, which are numbered from
1 to
N. You are guaranteed that vertex
1 is not an articulation point (which means that even after removing the vertex
1, the remaining graph is connected) and has an edge connecting it to each of the other
N−1 vertices.
For each
K∈{1,2,…,N−1} you need to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree where the degree of vertex
1 is equal to
K.
###Input:
The first line of input contains two integers
N,M: the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Each of the next
M lines contains three integers
U
i
,V
i
,W
i
, denoting an edge between vertices
U
i
and
V
i
with weight
W
i
.
###Output: Print
N−1 integers in a single line - the minimum weight of a spanning tree where the degree of vertex
1 is equal to
1,2,…,N−1.
###Constraints

It is guaranteed that the graph contains no multiple edges and vertex
1 is not an articulation point and its degree is equal to
N−1.
