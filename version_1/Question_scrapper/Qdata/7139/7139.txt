Consider an undirected graph
G with
N vertices and
M edges. A line graph
L(G) of this graph is a graph with
M vertices; each of these vertices corresponds to an edge in
G and two vertices in
L(G) are connected by an edge if the corresponding edges in
G have a common vertex.
Let
L
k
(G) denote the result of performing the operation "replace
G by
L(G)"
k times, i.e.
L
1
(G)=L(G),
L
2
(G)=L(L(G)),
L
3
(G)=L(L(L(G))) and so on.
You are given an undirected simple graph
G with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and
M edges, and a positive integer
K. Find the size of the largest independent set in
L
K
(G). Since this value may be very large, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
K.
Each of the next
M lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that vertices
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of vertices in the largest independent set in
L
K
(G), modulo
998,244,353.
Constraints
2≤N,M≤2,000
1≤K≤7
1≤u,v≤N
G does not contain any self-loops or parallel edges
