Chef has an array
A of length
N.
Chef wants to append a non-negative integer
X to the array
A such that the bitwise OR of the entire array becomes
=Y i.e.
(A
1
 ∣ A
2
 ∣ … ∣ A
N
 ∣ X)=Y. (Here,
∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation)
Determine the minimum possible value of
X. If no possible value of
X exists, output
−1.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
Y — the size of the array
and final bitwise OR of the array
.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum possible value of
X for which
(A
1
 ∣ A
2
 ∣ … ∣ A
N
 ∣ X)=Y holds.
If no such value exists, output
−1.

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
(3 ∣ 5 ∣ 6 ∣ 2 ∣ X)=15 holds for the following values of
X:
{8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}. The minimum among them is
8.
Test Case 2: It can be proven that no valid value of
X exists.
Test Case 3:
(0 ∣ X)=1 holds for only
X=1.
