Given an array A (may contain duplicates) of N elements and a positive integer K. The task is to count the number of elements that occurs exactly floor(N/K) times in the array.
Example:
Input:N = 5 K = 2 
A[] = 1 4 1 2 4
Output:2
Explanation:In the given array, 1 and 4 occurs floor(5/2) = 2 times.
So count is 2.
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function countSpecials() which should count the elements which occur exactly floor(N/K) times.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= A <= 10
1 <= K <= 10
