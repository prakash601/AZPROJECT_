You are given an array
A of size
K.
Note that
1≤A
1
<A
2
<…<A
K
=N and
K≤N.
Consider an array
B of size
N. We define the prefix maximum array of
B as an array consisting of all
B
i
(in order), such that
B
i
>B
j
for all
j<i.
Your task is to find the number of permutations
P of length
N such that
A is the prefix maximum array of
P.
Since this number might be huge, output it modulo
998244353.
Note:
A permutation of length
N consists of all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
For the permutation
P=[2,1,4,3], the prefix maximum array is
[2,4], since the elements
A
1
and
A
3
satisfy the given condition.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the size of the permutation and the size of the prefix maximum array, respectively.
The next line contains
K space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
K
denoting the prefix maximum array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of permutations of length
N having the prefix maximum array
A, modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Here
N=4 and prefix maximum array is
[2,4]. The possible permutations are
[2,1,4,3],
[2,4,1,3], and
[2,4,3,1].
Test case
2: Here
N=3 and prefix maximum array is
[3]. The possible permutations are
[3,1,2] and
[3,2,1].
