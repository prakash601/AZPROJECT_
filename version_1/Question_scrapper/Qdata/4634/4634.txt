Given four integers a, b, c, d. Find number of solutions x < y, where a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d and x, y integers.
Input
The first line contains an integer T denoting number of tests.
First line of each test case contains four positive integer numbers a, b, c and d.
Output
For each test case, output a single number each in separate line denoting number of integer solutions as asked in the problem.
