Imagine that you are the CEO of a big old-fashioned company. Unlike any modern and progressive company (such as JetBrains), your company has a dress code. That's why you have already allocated a spacious room for your employees where they can change their clothes. Moreover, you've already purchased an
m
-compartment wardrobe, so the
i
-th employee can keep his/her belongings in the
i
-th cell (of course, all compartments have equal widths).
The issue has occurred: the wardrobe has sliding doors! More specifically, the wardrobe has
n
doors (numbered from left to right) and the
j
-th door has width equal to
aj
wardrobe's cells. The wardrobe has single rails so that no two doors can slide past each other.
Extremely schematic example of a wardrobe:
m=9
,
n=2
,
a1=2
,
a2=3
.
The problem is as follows: sometimes to open some cells you must close some other cells (since all doors are placed on the single track). For example, if you have a
4
-compartment wardrobe (i.e.
m=4
) with
n=2
one-cell doors (i.e.
a1=a2=1
) and you need to open the
1
-st and the
3
-rd cells, you have to close the
2
-nd and the
4
-th cells.
As CEO, you have a complete schedule for the next
q
days. Now you are wondering: is it possible that all employees who will come on the
k
-th day can access their cells simultaneously?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
,
1≤m≤4⋅105
) — the number of doors and compartments respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤m
,
∑ai≤m
) — the corresponding widths of the doors.
The third line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅105
) — the number of days you have to process.
The next
q
lines describe schedule of each day. Each schedule is represented as an integer
ck
followed by
ck
integers
w1,w2,…,wck
(
1≤ck≤2⋅105
,
1≤w1<w2<⋯<wck≤m
) — the number of employees who will come on the
k
-th day, and their indices in ascending order.
It's guaranteed that
∑ck
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
Print
q
answers. Each answer is "YES" or "NO" (case insensitive). Print "YES" if it is possible, that all employees on the corresponding day can access their compartments simultaneously.
