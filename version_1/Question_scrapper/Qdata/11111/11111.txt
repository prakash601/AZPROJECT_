There are
n
segments drawn on a plane; the
i
-th segment connects two points (
xi,1
,
yi,1
) and (
xi,2
,
yi,2
). Each segment is non-degenerate, and is either horizontal or vertical — formally, for every
i∈[1,n]
either
xi,1=xi,2
or
yi,1=yi,2
(but only one of these conditions holds). Only segments of different types may intersect: no pair of horizontal segments shares any common points, and no pair of vertical segments shares any common points.
We say that four segments having indices
h1
,
h2
,
v1
and
v2
such that
h1<h2
and
v1<v2
form a rectangle if the following conditions hold:
segments
h1
and
h2
are horizontal;
segments
v1
and
v2
are vertical;
segment
h1
intersects with segment
v1
;
segment
h2
intersects with segment
v1
;
segment
h1
intersects with segment
v2
;
segment
h2
intersects with segment
v2
.
Please calculate the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle. Note that the conditions
h1<h2
and
v1<v2
should hold.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
) — the number of segments.
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th line contains four integers
xi,1
,
yi,1
,
xi,2
and
yi,2
denoting the endpoints of the
i
-th segment. All coordinates of the endpoints are in the range
[−5000,5000]
.
It is guaranteed that each segment is non-degenerate and is either horizontal or vertical. Furthermore, if two segments share a common point, one of these segments is horizontal, and another one is vertical.
Output
Print one integer — the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle.
