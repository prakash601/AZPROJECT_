You are given two integers
X and
Y. You need to construct two different strings
S
1
and
S
2
consisting of only the characters
‘a’ and
‘b’, such that the following conditions are satisfied:
Both
S
1
and
S
2
are palindromes.
Both
S
1
and
S
2
should contain exactly
X occurrences of
a and
Y occurrences of
b.
If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them. If it is not possible to construct two distinct strings satisfying the conditions, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers
X,Y.
Output Format
For each test case:
If it is not possible to construct two distinct strings satisfying the conditions, print
−1
Otherwise, print two lines — the first should contain the string
S
1
and the second should contain
S
2
If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤X,Y≤10

Explanation:
Test case
1: The three palindromes containing
2
a-s and
4
b-s are
abbbba,babbab, and
bbaabb. Printing any two of these is a valid answer.
Test case
2: There are no palindromes containing
3 each of
a and
b.
