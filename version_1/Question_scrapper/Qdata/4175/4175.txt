You are given an array
A of length
N.
A pair
(i,j)
(1≤i<j≤N) is said to be good if
gcd(A
i
,A
j
)=lcm(A
i
,A
j
). Here
gcd denotes the greatest common divisor and
lcm denotes least common multiple.
Find the total number of good pairs present in the given array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
space-separated integers
A
