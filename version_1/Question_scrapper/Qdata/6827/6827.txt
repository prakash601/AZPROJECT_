Shamili has an array
A=[A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
] of length
N. She painted each element of this array in either Black or White.
She allows you to right rotate the values in array
A by any value
k. In other words, let
B be the resulting array after right rotating
A by
k, then
B
i
=A
(i−k+n)(modN)
where
B
0
and
A
0
are the first elements in the arrays
A and
B respectively). Note that when you rotate the array
A, their colors won't get rotated and only the values in it get rotated. For example, let the array
A be
[3,2,7,6] and their colors be
[Black, Black, White, White
]. Right rotating
A by
2 will give you the array
[7,6,3,2] with colors
[Black, Black, White, White
].
Let
maxb be the maximum value among all the elements that are painted in Black and
minw be the minimum value among all the elements that are painted in White. Shamili asked you to find the maximum value of
maxb−minw after right rotating the array
a at most once.
It is guaranteed that at least one element in the array is colored in Black and at least one element is colored in White.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains the integer

A is 0-indexed.
The third line of each test case contains a string
C of size
N representing the color of each element. (
C
i
=‘B‘ if the
i
th
element in array
A is painted in Black color and
C

=‘W‘ if the

th
element is painted in White color). Note that
C is also 0-indexed, i.e. the first character of
C is

and the last character is

Explanation:
Test case
1: When we right rotate the array by
1, the resulting array will be
[6,5,1,2]. Now the maximum value in Black elements is
6 (
maxb) and minimum value in White elements (
minw) is
2. Therefore, the answer will be
6−2=4. It can be shown that this is the maximum result possible.
Test case
2: We can convert the given array to
[9,3,1,8,2]. So, the maximum value is
9−1=8.
