Chef loves problems about digits and he came up with an interesting one.
Chef has given you two integers
N and
K. You should find the minimum non-negative integer
X, such that
N+X has at most
K distinct digits in its decimal representation.
For example,
1231 has three distinct digits and
100 has two distinct digits.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers
N and
K, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum non-negative integer
X which satisfies the problem conditions.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
30 has
2 distinct digits which is more than
1, so we should add
3 to
30 to make it equal to
33 which has only
1 distinct digit.
