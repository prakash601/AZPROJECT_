A string is almost palindromic if we can rearrange its characters in such a way that it becomes a palindrome. A positive integer is almost palindromic if its decimal representation without leading zeros is an almost palindromic string.
You are given two integers
L and
R. Find the number of almost palindromic integers between
L and
R (inclusive). Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R (without leading zeros).
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of almost palindromic integers modulo
10
9
+7.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤L≤R<10

the sum of lengths of
R over all test cases does not exceed
