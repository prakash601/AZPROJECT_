Given an array
a
of positive integers with length
n
, determine if there exist three distinct indices
i
,
j
,
k
such that
ai+aj+ak
ends in the digit
3
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of the array.
The sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
Output
t
lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. Output "YES" if there exist three distinct indices
i
,
j
,
k
satisfying the constraints in the statement, and "NO" otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note
In the first test case, you can select
i=1
,
j=4
,
k=3
. Then
a1+a4+a3=20+84+19=123
, which ends in the digit
3
.
In the second test case, you can select
i=1
,
j=2
,
k=3
. Then
a1+a2+a3=1+11+1=13
, which ends in the digit
3
.
In the third test case, it can be proven that no such
i
,
j
,
k
exist. Note that
i=4
,
j=4
,
k=4
is not a valid solution, since although
a4+a4+a4=1111+1111+1111=3333
, which ends in the digit
3
, the indices need to be distinct.
In the fourth test case, it can be proven that no such
i
,
j
,
k
exist.
In the fifth test case, you can select
i=4
,
j=3
,
k=1
. Then
a4+a3+a1=4+8+1=13
, which ends in the digit
3
.
In the sixth test case, you can select
i=1
,
j=2
,
k=6
. Then
a1+a2+a6=16+38+99=153
, which ends in the digit
3
.
