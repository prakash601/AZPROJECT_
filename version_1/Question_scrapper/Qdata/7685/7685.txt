You are given a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N).
A simple path between two different vertices
a and
b (
a<b) is called a clamp path if it does not contain any vertices with numbers smaller then
a or greater than
b.
Calculate the number of clamp paths in the given tree.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

. For each valid
i, if
p

=0, then there is an edge between vertices
i and
p

.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of clamp paths.

Example Output
10
Explanation
The clamp paths are 1 - 4, 1 - 5, 1 - 6, 1 - 7, 2 - 5, 2 - 7, 3 - 5, 3 - 7, 4 - 5 and 4 - 7.
