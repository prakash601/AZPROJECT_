A good number is a positive integer which is not divisible by the cube (third power) of any prime. For example,
2,
3,
25=5⋅5,
63=7⋅9 and
2057=11⋅11⋅17 are good numbers, but
8=2⋅2⋅2,
9317=7⋅11⋅11⋅11 and
2401=7⋅7⋅7⋅7 are not good numbers.
A pair of positive integers
(x,y) is special if
x⋅y is a good number. A set of positive integers is nice if each pair of different integers from this set is special. In particular, the empty set is nice.
You are given a set of integers
{A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
}. Find the number of nice subsets of this set.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of nice subsets.
