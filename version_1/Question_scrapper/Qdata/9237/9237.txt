This is an interactive task
William has a certain sequence of integers
a1,a2,…,an
in his mind, but due to security concerns, he does not want to reveal it to you completely. William is ready to respond to no more than
2⋅n
of the following questions:
What is the result of a bitwise AND of two items with indices
i
and
j
(
i≠j
)
What is the result of a bitwise OR of two items with indices
i
and
j
(
i≠j
)
You can ask William these questions and you need to find the
k
-th smallest number of the sequence.
Formally the
k
-th smallest number is equal to the number at the
k
-th place in a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order. For example in array
[5,3,3,10,1]
4
th smallest number is equal to
5
, and
2
nd and
3
rd are
3
.
Input
It is guaranteed that for each element in a sequence the condition
0≤ai≤109
is satisfied.
Interaction
In the first line you will be given two integers
n
and
k
(3≤n≤104,1≤k≤n)
, which are the number of items in the sequence
a
and the number
k
.
After that, you can ask no more than
2⋅n
questions (not including the "finish" operation).
Each line of your output may be of one of the following types:
"or i j"
(1≤i,j≤n,i≠j)
, where
i
and
j
are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise OR.
"and i j"
(1≤i,j≤n,i≠j)
, where
i
and
j
are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise AND.
"finish res", where
res
is the
k
th smallest number in the sequence. After outputting this line the program execution must conclude.
In response to the first two types of queries, you will get an integer
x
, the result of the operation for the numbers you have selected.
After outputting a line do not forget to output a new line character and flush the output buffer. Otherwise you will get the "Idleness limit exceeded". To flush the buffer use:
fflush(stdout) in C++
System.out.flush() in Java
stdout.flush() in Python
flush(output) in Pascal
for other languages refer to documentation
If you perform an incorrect query the response will be
−1
. After receiving response
−1
you must immediately halt your program in order to receive an "Incorrect answer" verdict.
Hacking
To perform a hack you will need to use the following format:
The first line must contain two integers
n
and
k
(3≤n≤104,1≤k≤n)
, which are the number of items in the sequence
a
and the number
k
.
The second line must contain
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(0≤ai≤109)
, the sequence
a
.
Example
input
Copy
7 6

2

7
output
Copy
and 2 5

or 5 6

finish 5
Note
In the example, the hidden sequence is
[1,6,4,2,3,5,4]
.
Below is the interaction in the example.
Query (contestant's program) Response (interactor) Notes
and 2 5 2
a2=6
,
a5=3
. Interactor returns bitwise AND of the given numbers.
or 5 6 7
a5=3
,
a6=5
. Interactor returns bitwise OR of the given numbers.
finish 5
5
is the correct answer. Note that you must find the value and not the index of the kth smallest number.
