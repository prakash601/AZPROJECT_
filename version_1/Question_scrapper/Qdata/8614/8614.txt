You are given three arrays
a
,
b
and
c
. Initially, array
a
consists of
n
elements, arrays
b
and
c
are empty.
You are performing the following algorithm that consists of two steps:
Step
1
: while
a
is not empty, you take the last element from
a
and move it in the middle of array
b
. If
b
currently has odd length, you can choose: place the element from
a
to the left or to the right of the middle element of
b
. As a result,
a
becomes empty and
b
consists of
n
elements.
Step
2
: while
b
is not empty, you take the middle element from
b
and move it to the end of array
c
. If
b
currently has even length, you can choose which of two middle elements to take. As a result,
b
becomes empty and
c
now consists of
n
elements.
Refer to the Note section for examples.
Can you make array
c
sorted in non-decreasing order?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅104
) — the number of test cases. Next
t
cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤106
) — the array
a
itself.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test, print YES (case-insensitive), if you can make array
c
sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, print NO (case-insensitive).

Note
In the first test case, we can do the following for
a=[3,1,5,3]
:
Step
1
:
a
[3,1,5,3]
⇒
[3,1,5]
⇒
[3,1]
⇒
[3]
⇒

Step
2
:

⇒
[3,

[1]
[1,3]
[1,3,3]
[1,3,3,5]
As a result, array
c=[1,3,3,5]
and it's sorted.
