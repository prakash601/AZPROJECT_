Chef has an array
a
1
,…,a
n
of
n elements. He wants you to answer queries of the following type:
Compute
f(L,R), where
f(L,R)=∑
i=L
R
∑
j=i
R
gcd(a
i
,a
i+1
,…a
j
). In other words, we want to compute the sum of the greatest common divisors over all subarrays of some range
[L,R]. Help Chef answer
q queries of the described type.
###Input:
The first line contains two integers
n and
q - the size of the array and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n integers
a
1
,…,a
n
.
Each of the following
q lines contains two integers
l,
r.
The queries are encrypted. Let the answer to the previous query be
x (or
0 if there is none). The query is decrypted as follows:
L=((l+x)modn)+1 and
R=((r+x)modn)+1.
###Output:
Print
q integers - the answer to each query modulo

Explanation:
The decoded queries are respectively
f(1,5);
f(3,4);
f(2,5);
f(3,5);
f(1,3);
