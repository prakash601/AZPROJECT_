Given a linked list, the task is to complete the function maxPalindrome() which returns an integer denoting  the length of the longest palindrome list that exist in the given linked list.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the linked list . Then in the next line are N space separated values of the given linked list.
Output:
For each test case output will be the required max length of the palindrome present in the given linked list.
User Task:
The task is to complete the function maxPalindrome() which should count the length of longest palindrome in the given list and return it.


Example:
Input:
2
7
2 3 7 3 2 12 24
5
12 4 4 3 14
Output:
5
2
Explanation:
Testcase 1: 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 is the linked list whose nodes leads to a palindrome as 2 3 7 3 2.
