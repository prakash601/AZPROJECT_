You are given two arrays
A and
B, each of size
N.
Let
P denote a permutation length
N. The permutation
P is said to be good, if you can make an array
C where:
C
i
=A
i
+B
P
i
or
C
i
=A
i
−B
P
i
, for all
(1≤i≤N);
All elements of
C are equal.
Out of the
N! possible permutations, find the count of good permutations.
Since the count can be huge, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Note that a permutation of length
N consists of all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case consists of a single integer
N - the size of arrays.
The second line of each test case consists of
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A

N
, the elements of array A.
The third line of each test case consists of N space-separated integers
B

, the elements of array B.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the count of good permutations, modulo
10

+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The only good permutation is
[3,2,1]. We construct
C as following:
C
1
=A
1
+B
P
1
=A
1
+B
3
=10−1=9;
C
2
=A
2
−B
P
2
=A
2
−B
2
=5−(−4)=9;
C
3
=A
3
−B
P
3
=A
3
−B
1
=2−(−7)=9.
Here all elements of array
C are equal. It can be shown that for all other permutations, it is impossible to create such an array
C. Thus, the count of good permutations is
1.
Test case
2: The good permutations are
[2,1,3],[3,1,2]. We construct
C as following using
[2,1,3]:
C
1
=A
1
−B
P
1
=A
1
−B
2
=6−5=1;
C
2
=A
2
+B
P
2
=A
2
+B
1
=7+(−6)=1;
C
3
=A
3
−B
P
3
=A
3
−B
3
=8−7=1.
Here all elements of array
C are equal. It can be shown that for
[3,1,2], it is possible to create such an array
C. Thus, the count of good permutations is
2.
