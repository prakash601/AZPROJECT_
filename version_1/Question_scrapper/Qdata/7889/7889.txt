You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
, consisting of
n
integers. You are also given two integers
k
and
x
.
You have to perform the following operation exactly once: add
x
to the elements on exactly
k
distinct positions, and subtract
x
from all the others.
For example, if
a=[2,−1,2,3]
,
k=1
,
x=2
, and we have picked the first element, then after the operation the array
a=[4,−3,0,1]
.
Let
f(a)
be the maximum possible sum of a subarray of
a
. The subarray of
a
is a contiguous part of the array
a
, i. e. the array
ai,ai+1,…,aj
for some
1≤i≤j≤n
. An empty subarray should also be considered, it has sum
0
.
Let the array
a′
be the array
a
after applying the aforementioned operation. Apply the operation in such a way that
f(a′)
is the maximum possible, and print the maximum possible value of
f(a′)
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
k
and
x
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
;
0≤k≤min(20,n)
;
−109≤x≤109
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible value of
f(a′)
.
