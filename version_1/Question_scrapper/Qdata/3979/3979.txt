Explanation:
Test case 1:
In the first operation, we can choose
S={1} and
α= c. After this operation,
A will become cb.
In the second operation, we can choose
S={2} and
α= d. After this operation,
A will become cd.
Test case 2:
In the first operation, we can choose
S={1,3} and
α= b. After this operation,
A will become bab.
Test case 3:
In the first operation, we can choose
S={2,3} and
α= a. After this operation,
A will become aaad.
In the second operation, we can choose
S={4} and
α= b. After this operation,
A will become aaab.
