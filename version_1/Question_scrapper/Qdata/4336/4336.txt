Chef gives an array
A with
N elements to Babla. Babla's task is to find the maximum non-negative integer
X such that:
No element in the array belongs to the range
[−X,X]. In other words, for all
(1≤i≤N), either
A
i
<−X or
A
i
>X.
Help Babla to find the maximum non-negative integer
X for which the given condition is satisfied or determine if no such
X exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum non-negative integer
X, satisfying the above condition.
If no such
X exists, output
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The maximum value of
X such that no element of the array belongs to the range
[−X,X] is
1. All elements of the array are strictly greater than
1.
Test case
2: The maximum value of
X such that no element of the array belongs to the range
[−X,X] is
6. All positive elements of the array are strictly greater than
6 and negative elements are strictly less than
−6.
Test case
3: It is not possible to choose an element
X that satisfies the given condition.
