There are N sets numbered 1 to N, all initially empty.
Your task is to perform two kinds of queries:
0 l r x : add the number x to all the sets numbered from l to r. (Note that a set, by definition, can never contain duplicate elements. So a number is only added to a set if it was not already present.)
1 q : output the size of the set numbered q.
Input
The following M lines describe the queries. Each of these lines describes exactly one query in the format specified above.
Output
For each query of type 1, output the size of the specified set.
Constraints
Subtask 1 (14 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100
Subtask 2 (25 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000
Subtask 3 (61 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2.5 * 105
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N
1 ≤ q, x ≤ N
Example
Input:
5 5
0 2 4 4
0 3 5 5
0 1 5 5
1 5
1 3
Output:
1
2
Explanation
Have a look at the sets during the operations:
Initially, all the sets are empty: {{}, {}, {}, {}, {}}.
In the first query we add 4 to sets numbered 2 to 4 to get: {{}, {4}, {4}, {4}, {}}.
In the second query we add 5 to the sets numbered 3 to 5 to get: {{}, {4}, {4, 5}, {4, 5}, {5}}.
In the third query we add 5 to all the sets to get: {{5}, {4, 5}, {4, 5}, {4, 5}, {5}}.
The 5th set is {5}, its size is 1.
The 3rd set is {4, 5}, and its size is 2.
