The country of Berland initially has
N isolated cities, the
i-th city has a significance of
A

. The President of Berland wants to connect all the cities. He can construct a bidirectional road of length
L
(L>0) from city
X to city
Y if
(A
X
&A
Y
&L)=L, where
& represents the bitwise AND operator.
What is the minimum total length of roads he has to construct, in order to connect all the cities in Berland? Print
−1 if it is impossible.
Note: City

(1≤i<K). All the cities in Berland are said to be connected when every pair of cities in Berland are connected.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
