This problem differs from the previous one only in the absence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers
a1,a2,…,an
.
A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.
Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers
f(a1a2…ap−1ap,b1b2…bq−1bq)
, where
a1…ap
and
b1…bq
are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.
In other words, the function
f(x,y)
alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers
x
and
y
by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number
y
. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.
For example:
f(1111,2222)=12121212
f(7777,888)=7787878
f(33,44444)=4443434
f(555,6)=5556
f(111,2222)=2121212
Formally,
if
p≥q
then
f(a1…ap,b1…bq)=a1a2…ap−q+1b1ap−q+2b2…ap−1bq−1apbq
;
if
p<q
then
f(a1…ap,b1…bq)=b1b2…bq−pa1bq−p+1a2…ap−1bq−1apbq
.
Mishanya gives you an array consisting of
n
integers
ai
