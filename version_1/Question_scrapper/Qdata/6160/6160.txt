You are given a grid with
N rows and
M columns, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'.
You may perform the following operation up to
K times: choose two different cells and swap the values in them. Find the largest possible side length of a square subgrid which contains only '0'-s after performing these operations.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T, total number of testcases.
Each testcase contains
N+1 lines of input.
The first line contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
K.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains a single string with length
M describing the
i-th row of the grid.
Output
For each testcase, print a single line containing one integer ― the largest side length of a square subgrid containing only '0'-s.

Explanation
Case 1: Since all the '0'-s in the grid already form a square with side length
3, no swaps are required.
Case 2: If we could swap the values in pairs of cells
(0,1),
(0,6) and
(2,1),
(2,4), we would get a square with side length
3 using
2 swaps. But since the maximum possible number of swaps is
1, the answer cannot be greater than
2.
Case 3: We can swap the values in pairs of cells
(0,1),
(0,6) and
(2,1),
(2,4). Then, we get a square with side length
3 using
2 swaps.
