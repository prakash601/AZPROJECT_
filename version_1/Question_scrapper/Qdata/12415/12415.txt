Given an integer
x
. Your task is to find out how many positive integers
n
(
1≤n≤x
) satisfy
n⋅an≡b(modp),
where
a,b,p
are all known constants.
Input
The only line contains four integers
a,b,p,x
(
2≤p≤106+3
,
1≤a,b<p
,
1≤x≤1012
). It is guaranteed that
p
is a prime.
Output
Print a single integer: the number of possible answers
n
.
