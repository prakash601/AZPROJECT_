Authors guessed an array
a
consisting of
n
integers; each integer is not less than
2
and not greater than
2⋅105
. You don't know the array
a
, but you know the array
b
which is formed from it with the following sequence of operations:
Firstly, let the array
b
be equal to the array
a
;
Secondly, for each
i
from
1
to
n
:
if
ai
is a prime number, then one integer
pai
is appended to array
b
, where
p
is an infinite sequence of prime numbers (
2,3,5,…
);
otherwise (if
ai
is not a prime number), the greatest divisor of
ai
which is not equal to
ai
is appended to
b
;
Then the obtained array of length
2n
is shuffled and given to you in the input.
Here
pai
means the
ai
-th prime number. The first prime
p1=2
, the second one is
p2=3
, and so on.
Your task is to recover any suitable array
a
that forms the given array
b
. It is guaranteed that the answer exists (so the array
b
is obtained from some suitable array
a
). If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of elements in
a
.
The second line of the input contains
2n
integers
b1,b2,…,b2n
(
2≤bi≤2750131
), where
bi
is the
i
-th element of
b
.
2750131
is the
199999
-th prime number.
Output
In the only line of the output print
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
2≤ai≤2⋅105
) in any order — the array
a
from which the array
b
can be obtained using the sequence of moves given in the problem statement. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
