You are given an integer sequence
A with length
N. Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers
(a,b) such that
a occurs in
A at least
b times and
b occurs in
A at least
a times.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
.
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pairs.
