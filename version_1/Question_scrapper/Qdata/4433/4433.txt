You are given an array
A of
N integers. You can do the following two types of operations any (possibly zero) number of times:
Pick two indices
i and
j
(1≤i,j≤∣A∣,i

=j). Change
A
j
:=A
j
+A
i
and remove the
i
th
element from the array.
Pick an index
i
(1≤i≤∣A∣). Split
A
i
into two positive integers
X and
Y such that
X+Y=A
i
. Remove the
i
th
element from the array and append elements
X and
Y to the array.
Find the maximum number of distinct elements present in the array after performing any number of operations of the above two types.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of distinct elements present in the array after performing any number of operations of the above two types.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The maximum number of distinct elements that can be achieved by performing some finite number of operations on the given array is
3. Some examples of the final array are:
[1,2,4] : Perform no operation on the given array.
[1,2,1,3] : Perform operation
2. Choose
i=3. Here,
A
3
=4. Break it as
X=1 and
Y=3. On removing
A
3
and appending
X and
Y, we get
[1,2,1,3]. This array has
3 distinct elements.
Test case
2: The maximum number of distinct elements that can be achieved by performing some finite number of operations on the given array is
3. Some examples of the final array are:
[1,1,3,4] : Perform no operation on the given array.
[1,1,3,2,2] : Perform operation
2. Choose
i=4. Here,
A
4
=4. Break it as
X=2 and
Y=2. On removing
A
4
and appending
X and
Y, we get
[1,1,3,2,2]. This array has
3 distinct elements.
[2,3,4] : Perform operation
1. Choose
i=1 and
j=2. On changing
