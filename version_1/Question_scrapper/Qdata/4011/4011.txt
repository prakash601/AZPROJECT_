In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with
N Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side
S requires
S
2
Circles to create.
Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer
N.
###Output: For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.
###Constraints

Explanation:
Test case 1 : Mr Sphere forms a square of side 9 using 81 Circles and then forms a square of side 2 using the remaining 4.
