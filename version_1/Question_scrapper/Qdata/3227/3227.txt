Given an ArrayList of N lowercase characters. The task is to count the frequency of elements in the list.
Note: use add() to append element in the list and contains() to check an element is present or not in the list and Collections.frequency() to find the frequency of the element in the list.
Input Format:
The first line of the test case contains T, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains the number of queries Q. Each query may be any one of the two types:
1. "i" with "c" : insert the element "c" into the ArrayList
2. "f" with "c": find the frequency of "c" in the ArrayList.
Output Format:
For each test case, output the frequency of elements. Print "Not Present" if the element is not present in the list else its frequency in a new line for every query.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Q <= 102
Example:
Input:
2
6
i g i e i e i k i s f e
4
i c i p i p f f
Output:
2
Not Present
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Inserting g, e, e, k, s into the list. The frequency of e is 2 in the list.
Testcase 2: Inserting c, p, p into the list. The frequency of f is 0 in the list.
