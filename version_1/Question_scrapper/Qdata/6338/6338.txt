Chef is given a rooted tree with
N nodes numbered
1 to
N where
1 is the root node.
Each node is assigned a lowercase english alphabet between a to z (both included).
Given two nodes
A and
B:
Let
LCA(A,B) denote the lowest common ancestor of nodes
A and
B.
Let
DIS(A,B) denote the string containing all the characters associated with the nodes in the same order as the shortest path from node
A to node
B (excluding the character associated to node
B). Note that
DIS(A,A) is an empty string.
Chef needs to answer
Q queries. Each query is of the type:
U
V: Given two integers
U and
V
(1≤U,V≤N), determine if there exists a concatenation of a non-empty subsequence of
DIS(U,LCA(U,V)) and a non-empty subsequence of
DIS(V,LCA(U,V)) such that it is a palindrome.
Input Format
The first line of each test case contains
T, the number of test cases.
The second line of each test case contains
N, the number of nodes in the tree.
The third line of each test case contains a string
S consisting of
N characters. Here,
S
i
corresponds to the character associated with node
i.
The next
(N−1) lines each contain two space-separated integers
x and
y, denoting that an edge exists between nodes
x and
y.
The next line contains
Q, the number of queries.
The next
Q lines each contain two space-separated integers
U and
V, denoting the query.
Output Format
For each test case, output
Q lines. Print YES in the
i
th
line if there exist a concatenation of a non-empty subsequence of
DIS(U,LCA(U,V)) and a non-empty subsequence of
DIS(V,LCA(U,V)) such that it is a palindrome for the
i
th
query. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
The tree looks like:
Query
1:
LCA(3,5)=2.
DIS(3,LCA(3,5))=DIS(3,2)= b. Similarly,
DIS(5,LCA(3,5))=DIS(5,2)= c. It is not possible to concatenate non-empty subsequences from
DIS(3,2) and
DIS(5,2) such that we get a palindrome.
Query
2:
LCA(3,6)=1.
DIS(3,LCA(3,6))=DIS(3,1)= bd. Similarly,
DIS(6,LCA(3,6))=DIS(6,1)= bx. We can pick subsequence b from both
DIS(3,1) and
DIS(6,1). After concatenation, we get bb which is a palindrome.
