You are given
n
numbers
a1,a2,…,an
. In one operation we can add to any one of those numbers a nonnegative integer power of
2
.
What is the smallest number of operations we need to perform to make all
n
numbers equal? It can be proved that under given constraints it doesn't exceed
1018
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤1017
).
Output
Output exactly one integer — the smallest number of operations we need to perform to make all
n
numbers equal.

Note
In the first example, all numbers are already equal. So the needed number of operation is
0
.
In the second example, we can apply the operation
3
times: add
8
to first
2
, add
8
to second
2
, add
2
to
8
, making all numbers equal to
10
. It can be proved that we can't make all numbers equal in less than
3
operations.
