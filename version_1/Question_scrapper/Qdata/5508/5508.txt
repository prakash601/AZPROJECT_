Cyborg Jenish is angry.
He has so much rage that he decided to go on a demolition spree for
Q days.
There are
N cities in his world numbered
1 to
N, in a row from left to right. That is the
i
th
city from left side is city-
i where
1≤i≤N. The supreme leader of the world is VSM and there are infinite statues of VSM in each city.
On each day Jenish chooses two cities
L and
R. He starts at city-
L and moves along the row towards right side till he reaches the city-
R. In city-
L he destroys
1 statue, in the next city (i.e. city-
L+1) he destroys
2 statues, and so on till city-
R where he destroys
R−L+1 statues. In other words, he destroys
i−L+1 statues in the
i
th
city (
L≤i≤R ).
Find the total number of VSM statues he destroyed in each city after
Q days.
Input:
The first line contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case, contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q denoting the number of cities in his world and the number of days he goes on a demolition spree respectively.
The
i
th
line of next
Q lines of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R denoting the starting city and the ending city respectively on
i
th
day.
###Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing
N space-separated integers.
The
i
th
integer should denote the total number of VSM statues destroyed by cyborg Jenish in the city-
i after
Q days.

Explanation:
In the first test case, the cyborg does the following:
Starts at city-1 and goes till city-3, hence destroys
1 statue in city-1,
2 in city-2, and
3 in city-3.
Starts at city-1 and goes till city-2, hence destroys
1 statue in city-1 and
2 in city-2.
Starts at city-4 and goes till city-5, hence destroys
1 statue in city-4 and
2 in city-5.
Hence he destroyed total
2 statues in city-1,
4 in city-2,
3 in city-3,
1 in city-4, and
2 in city-5.
