=0, where
& denotes the bitwise AND operator.
Since the number of tuples can be large, output it modulo
10

+7.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
and
.
Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem modulo
10
