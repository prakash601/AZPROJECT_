You are given the sequence
a1,a2,…,an
. You can choose any subset of elements and then reorder them to create a "saw".
The sequence
b1,b2,…,bm
is called a "saw" if the elements satisfy one of the following series of inequalities:
b1>b2<b3>b4<…
or
b1<b2>b3<b4>…
.
Find the longest saw which can be obtained from a given array.
Note that both the given sequence
a
and the required saw
b
can contain duplicated (non-unique) values.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then the descriptions of the
t
test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
). Then a line containing
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) follows.
It's guaranteed that
∑n
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print two lines: print the length of the longest saw in the first line, and the saw itself in the second line. If there are several solutions, print any of them.
