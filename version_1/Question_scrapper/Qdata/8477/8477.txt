There is an array
a
of length
n
. You may perform the following operation on it:
Choose two indices
l
and
r
where
1≤l≤r≤n
and
al=ar
. Then, reverse the subsegment from the
l
-th to the
r
-th element, i. e. set
[al,al+1,…,ar−1,ar]
to
[ar,ar−1,…,al+1,al]
.
You are also given another array
b
of length
n
which is a permutation of
a
. Find a sequence of at most
n2
operations that transforms array
a
into
b
, or report that no such sequence exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤500
) — the length of array
a
and
b
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — elements of the array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤n
) — elements of the array
b
.
It is guaranteed that
b
is a permutation of
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
500
.
Output
For each test case, output "NO" (without quotes) if it is impossible to turn
a
into
b
using at most
n2
operations.
Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then output an integer
k
(
0≤k≤n2
) denoting the number of operations you will perform. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
Afterwards, output
k
lines. The
i
-th line should contain two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
) — the left and right indices for the
i
-th operation.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).
If there are multiple possible sequences of operations, you may output any of them.

Note
In the first test case, we can perform the following operations:
[1,2,4,3,1,2,1,1]
→
l=5,r=8
[1,2,4,3,1,1,2,1]
→
l=1,r=6
[1,1,3,4,2,1,2,1].
In the second test case, we can perform the following operations:
[1,2,3,1,3,2,3]
→
l=1,r=4
[1,3,2,1,3,2,3]
→
l=3,r=6
[1,3,2,3,1,2,3].
It can be proven that it is impossible to turn
a
into
b
in the third and fourth test cases.
