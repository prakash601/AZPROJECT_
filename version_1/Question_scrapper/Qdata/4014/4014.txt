We have found a new chess character — pook. It has the qualities of both a rook and a pawn. Specifically, treating the chessboard to be an
N×N grid where
(i,j) denotes the intersection of the
i-th row and the
j-th column, a pook placed at square
(x,y) threatens the following squares:
(i,y) for every
1≤i≤N
(x,i) for every
1≤i≤N
(x+1,y−1), if
x<N and
y≥2
(x+1,y+1), if
x<N and
y<N
Find the maximum number of pooks that can be placed on an empty
N×N chessboard such that none of them threaten each other.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of pooks that can be placed on the chessboard such that they don't threaten each other.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is a single square, so we have a single pook.
Test case
2: We can only place one pook. No matter where the first is placed, placing a second will lead to one of the two being threatened.
Test case
3: Placing
2 pooks on a
3×3 grid is easy — for example, place one at
(1,2) and another at
(3,3). It can be shown that placing three is not possible.
