Given a number, reverse it and add it to itself unless it becomes a palindrome or number of iterations becomes more than 5.

Example 1:
Input: n = 23
Output: 55 
Explanation: reverse(23) = 32,then 32+23
= 55 which is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: n = 30
Output: 33
Explanation: reverse(30) = 3,then 3+30
= 33 which is palindrome.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isSumPalindrome() which takes n as input parameter and returns that palindrome number if it becomes a palindrome else returns -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*k),where k<=5.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= n <=104
