Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef has
10 airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of
2 passengers. Thus, there are
20 seats available in total.
There are
15 people who want to book a seat. Since we have enough seats for everyone, all
15 people can book their seats and pay
10 rupees each. The total money Chef earns is
15⋅10=150.
Test case
2: Chef has
10 airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of
1 passenger. Thus, there are
10 seats available in total.
There are
10 people who want to book a seat. Since we have enough seats for everyone, all
10 people can book their seats and pay
1 rupee each. The total money Chef earns is
10⋅1=10.
Test case
3: Chef has
10 airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of
5 passengers. Thus, there are
50 seats available in total.
There are
60 people who want to book a seat. Since we have only
50 seats, only
50 people can book their seats and pay
100 rupees each. The total money Chef earns is
50⋅100=5000.
Test case
4: Chef has
10 airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of
1 passenger. Thus, there are
10 seats available in total.
There are
11 people who want to book a seat. Since we have only
10 seats, only
10 people can book their seats and pay
7 rupees each. The total money Chef earns is
10⋅7=70.
