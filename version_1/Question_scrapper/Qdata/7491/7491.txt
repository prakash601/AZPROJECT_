These days, Chef is working on opening a restaurant. Obviously, Chef dislikes running the restaurant by himself. In order to avoid such a terrible thing, he decided to hire exactly
M workers (numbered
1 through
M) to help him.
The workers will choose some positive integer constants
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
M
. A worker with a constant
a wants to be paid a fixed salary after each
a days. Chef is very orderly, so he wants to choose a Chef-year — a period of
x days, and a Chef-week — a period of
y days, where
x and
y depend on the workers' constants in such a way that Chef can always pay each worker's salary at the end of a Chef-week and all the workers are paid their salaries at once at the end of a Chef-year.
Chef also wants a Chef-year to be as short as possible and a Chef-week to be as long as possible. It can be shown that these conditions are satisfied when
x is the lowest common multiple of
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
M
and
y is the greatest common divisor of
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
M
. For a group of
M workers with known
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
M
, Chef then defines the value of the group as
x
p
f(y)，where
f(x)=∑
i=0
q
f
i
x
q−i
is a polynomial of degree
q.
Now, Chef wants to know the sum of values of the group of
M workers over all possible sequences
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
M
which meet the constraint
x≤N. Since the answer may be extremely large, you should compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Note: This problem has a stricter submission limit, each user may only submit this problem at most 50 times during the contest.
Input
The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers
N,
M,
p and
q.
The second line contains
q+1 space-separated integers
f

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the sum of values for all possible groups of workers modulo

Explanation:
There are
15 possible sequences:
[1,1],
[1,2],
[1,3],
[1,4],
[1,5],
[2,1],
[2,2],
[2,4],
[3,1],
[3,3],
[4,1],
[4,2],
[4,4],
[5,1],
[5,5]. The sum of corresponding values is
1+2+3+4+5+2+4+8+3+9+4+8+16+5+25=99.
