Explanation:
Test case
1: The initial population of the town was
3 million, out of which
1 million people left and
2 million people entered the town. So, final population
=3−1+2=4 million.
Test case
2: The initial population of the town was
2 million, out of which
2 million left and
2 million immigrated. The final population is thus
2+2−2=2 million.
