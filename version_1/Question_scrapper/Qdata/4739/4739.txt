Given a string s. Can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character? Note that size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before.
Input
First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.
For each test case, you are given a single line containing string s.
Output
For each test case, print YES or NO depending on the answer of the problem.
Constraints
Subtask 1, 35 points
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ size of string s ≤ 1000
String s contains lowercase English alphabets (ie. from 'a' to 'z').
Subtask 2, 65 points
2 ≤ size of string s ≤ 10^5
Sum of size of string s over all the input test cases won't exceed 10^6
String s contains lowercase English alphabets (ie. from 'a' to 'z').

abba
YES
NO
YES
YES
Explanation:
Example case 1. Delete any one 'a', resulting string is "aa" which is a palindrome.
Example case 2. It is not possible to delete exactly one character and having a palindrome.
Example case 3. Delete 'c', resulting string is "abdba" which is a palindrome.
Example case 4. Delete 'b', resulting string is "aba" which is a palindrome.
