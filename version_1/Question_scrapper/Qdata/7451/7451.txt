Chefina gave Chef a sequence

as a birthday present. She constructed it from a sequence of positive integers
A

,…,A
N
in the following way: for each valid
i,
F
i
=∑
j=1
i
(−1)
(j+1)
⋅A
j
.
Unfortunately, Chef was playing with the sequence
F and shuffled it. Now, he has a sequence denoted by
B, but he does not remember
F. The only things he knows are that
F is a permutation of
B and among all such permutations which Chefina could have constructed, her sequence
F was the lexicographically smallest.
Chef does not want to disappoint Chefina, but he is too busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to help him recover
F. Find the sequence
F he got from Chefina or determine that he made another mistake and a sequence that satisfies the given conditions does not exist.

Output
For each test case:
If there is no solution, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes).

Explanation:
Example case 1: The only two permutations of
B are
[1,2] and
[2,1]. Out of them,
[1,2] could not have been generated by Chefina, since it would require
A=[1,−1], which contains a negative element. On the other hand, for
[2,1], we get
A=[2,1], so
F=[2,1] must be the sequence Chefina generated.
