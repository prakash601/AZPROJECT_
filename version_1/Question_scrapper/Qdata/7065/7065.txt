Consider any way to pair the integers
1 through
2N into
N pairs
(A
1
,B
1
),(A
2
,B
2
),…,(A
N
,B
N
) in such a way that each of these integers is present in exactly one pair,
A
i
<B
i
for each valid
i and
A
1
<A
2
<…<A
N
. Let's call such a sequence of pairs a pairing.
For a pairing
(A
1
,B
1
),(A
2
,B
2
),…,(A
N
,B
N
), we can create an undirected graph with
2N nodes (numbered
1 through
2N) and the following edges:
first type: for each valid
i, an edge between nodes
i and
i+1
second type: for each valid
i, an edge between nodes
A
i
and
B
i
This pairing is valid if for each edge
(i,i+1) of the first type, there is an edge of the second type
(A
j
,B
j
) which "surrounds" it, i.e. satisfies
A
j
≤i and
B
j
>i. The cost of a valid pairing is defined as the number of pairs of edges of the second type such that one of these edges is "nested" in the other, i.e. pairs
(A
i
,B
i
) and
(A
j
,B
j
) such that
A
i
<A
j
<B
j
<B
i
.
Find the sum of costs of all valid pairings. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo a given prime
P.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
P.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum of costs of all valid pairings modulo
P.

Explanation:
Example case 1: For
N=2, there are two valid pairings
[(1,3),(2,4)] and
[(1,4),(2,3)], with costs
0 and
1 respectively.
Example case 2: For
N=3, all valid pairings along with their costs are listed below.
[(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)] with cost
0
[(1,4),(2,6),(3,5)] with cost
1
[(1,5),(2,4),(3,6)] with cost
1
[(1,5),(2,6),(3,4)] with cost
2
[(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)] with cost
3
[(1,6),(2,4),(3,5)] with cost
2
[(1,3),(2,6),(4,5)] with cost
1
[(1,3),(2,5),(4,6)] with cost
0
[(1,6),(2,3),(4,5)] with cost
2
[(1,5),(2,3),(4,6)] with cost
1
The sum of all costs is
13 and its remainder modulo
5 is
3.
