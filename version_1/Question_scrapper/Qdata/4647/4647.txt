Chef has a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. In one operation, Chef can choose one index
i (
1≤i≤N) and change
A
i
to
A
i
p
, where
p=max(0,⌈
2
A
i
⌉−1).
Help Chef find the smallest number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even, or
−1 if it is impossible.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The sum of the sequence is
16, which is already even.
Example case 2: We can change
A
2
to
1, so that the sequence becomes
[4,1,7,8,10]. The sum of this sequence is
30, which is even.
Example case 3: The sum of the sequence is
18, which is already even.
Example case 4: It is impossible to make the sum of the sequence even.
