You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
of positive integers and an integer
K. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
choose an index
j between
1 and
N inclusive
choose a positive divisor
d of
A
j
such that
d≤K
divide
A
j
by
d
Determine if it is possible to modify the sequence
A in such a way that it would satisfy the following condition: there is no positive integer strictly greater than
1 which divides every element of
A. (In other words, the greatest common divisor of all elements of
A should be
.)
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the GCD of all elements of
A equal to
1 or "NO" if it is impossible.
