Chef has a square-shaped chart paper with the side length equal to
N. He wants to cut out
K×K squares from this chart paper.
Find the maximum number of
K×K squares he can cut from the entire chart paper.
Note that, some part of the chart paper might not be a included in any
K×K cutout square.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
— the side length of the entire chart paper and the side length of the cutout squares.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of
K×K squares Chef can cut from the entire chart paper.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤K≤N≤1000
