You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
nonnegative integers.
Let's define the prefix OR array
b
as the array
bi=a1 OR a2 OR … OR ai
, where
OR
represents the bitwise OR operation. In other words, the array
b
is formed by computing the
OR
of every prefix of
a
.
You are asked to rearrange the elements of the array
a
in such a way that its prefix OR array is lexicographically maximum.
An array
x
is lexicographically greater than an array
y
if in the first position where
x
and
y
differ,
xi>yi
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
nonnegative integers
a1,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case print
n
integers — any rearrangement of the array
a
that obtains the lexicographically maximum prefix OR array.
