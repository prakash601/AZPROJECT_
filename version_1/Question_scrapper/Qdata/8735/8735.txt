You are given
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
. For any real number
t
, consider the complete weighted graph on
n
vertices
Kn(t)
with weight of the edge between vertices
i
and
j
equal to
wij(t)=ai⋅aj+t⋅(ai+aj)
.
Let
f(t)
be the cost of the minimum spanning tree of
Kn(t)
. Determine whether
f(t)
is bounded above and, if so, output the maximum value it attains.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤104
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of vertices of the graph.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−106≤ai≤106
).
The sum of
n
for all test cases is at most
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line with the maximum value of
f(t)
(it can be shown that it is an integer), or INF if
f(t)
is not bounded above.
