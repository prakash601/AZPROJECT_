Consider a grid with
H rows (numbered
1 through
H) and
W columns (numbered
1 through
W). Let's denote the value in a cell in row
i and column
j by
h
i,j
.
N particles (numbered
1 through
N) are distributed in the cells in such a way that there is at most one particle in each cell. For each valid
i, the
i-th particle has a value
p
i
and it is placed in the cell in row
y
i
and column
x
i
.
Let's denote the set of all particles by
P and the set of all unordered pairs of particles that are located in side-adjacent cells by
E. We define the value of the grid as
V=∑
i∈P
p
i
⋅h
y
i
,x
i
+∑
(i,j)∈E
p
i
⋅p
j
.
You are given the grid and the locations of all particles, but not their exact values ― only
∣p
1
∣,∣p
2
∣,…,∣p
N
∣. Your task is to choose the sign of each value
p
i
in such a way that the value
V is maximum possible. Each sign may be chosen independently from all other signs.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
H,
W and
N.
H lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains
W space-separated integers
h
i,1
,h
i,2
,…,h
i,W
.
N more lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers
y
i
,
x
i
and
∣p
i
∣.
Output
For each test case, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the maximum value of
V.
The second line should contain
N space-separated integers. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these integers should be
1 if you choose a positive sign for the value of the
i-th particle (i.e. its value should be
∣p
i
∣) or
−1 if you choose a negative sign (i.e. its value should be
−∣p
i
∣).
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
