Polycarp is working on a new operating system called BerOS. He asks you to help with implementation of a file suggestion feature.
There are
n
files on hard drive and their names are
f1,f2,…,fn
. Any file name contains between
1
and
8
characters, inclusive. All file names are unique.
The file suggestion feature handles queries, each represented by a string
s
. For each query
s
it should count number of files containing
s
as a substring (i.e. some continuous segment of characters in a file name equals
s
) and suggest any such file name.
For example, if file names are "read.me", "hosts", "ops", and "beros.18", and the query is "os", the number of matched files is
2
(two file names contain "os" as a substring) and suggested file name can be either "hosts" or "beros.18".
Input
The first line of the input contains integer
n
(
1≤n≤10000
) — the total number of files.
The following
n
lines contain file names, one per line. The
i
-th line contains
fi
— the name of the
i
-th file. Each file name contains between
1
and
8
characters, inclusive. File names contain only lowercase Latin letters, digits and dot characters ('.'). Any sequence of valid characters can be a file name (for example, in BerOS ".", ".." and "..." are valid file names). All file names are unique.
The following line contains integer
q
(
1≤q≤50000
) — the total number of queries.
The following
q
lines contain queries
s1,s2,…,sq
, one per line. Each
sj
has length between
1
and
8
characters, inclusive. It contains only lowercase Latin letters, digits and dot characters ('.').
Output
Print
q
lines, one per query. The
j
-th line should contain the response on the
j
-th query — two values
cj
and
tj
, where
cj
is the number of matched files for the
j
-th query,
tj
is the name of any file matched by the
j
-th query. If there is no such file, print a single character '-' instead. If there are multiple matched files, print any.
