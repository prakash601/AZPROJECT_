Explanation:
Test case
1: We can apply the operation for
i=1. Thus, the array becomes
A=[1,2]. On applying the operation again for
i=1, the array becomes
A=[0,0]. Thus, the value of
∣A
1
∣+∣A
2
∣=0. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value of
∣A
1
∣+∣A
2
∣.
Test case
2: Apply the operation for
i=1. The array becomes
A=[0,−1,1]. Thus, the value
∣A
1
+∣A
2
∣+∣A
3
∣=0+1+1=2.
Test case
3: We apply three operations on indices
1,3, and
5 respectively. Thus, the final array becomes
A=[−5,0,−5,0,−5,0]. The value
∣A
1
∣+∣A
2
∣+…+∣A
6
∣=15.
Test case
4: We cannot apply any operation on the array as we cannot choose any valid index.
