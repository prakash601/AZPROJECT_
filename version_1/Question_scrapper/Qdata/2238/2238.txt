Given a binary array arr of size N and an integer M. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's produced by flipping at most M 0's.
  Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1, 0, 1}
M = 1
Output:
3
Explanation:
Maximum subarray is of size 3
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping one zero to 1.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 11
arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
M = 2
Output:
8
Explanation:
Maximum subarray is of size 8
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping two zeros to 1.
  Your Task:
Complete the function findZeroes() which takes array arr and two integers n, m, as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <= N <= 107
0 <= M <= N
0 <= arri <= 1
