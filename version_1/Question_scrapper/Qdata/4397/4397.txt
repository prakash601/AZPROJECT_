Alice and Bob play a game. They have an array
A of
N elements.
First, Alice picks any index
i
(1≤i≤N).
Then, Bob has to pick an index
j such that
∣i−j∣=1 ,i.e , he must pick an element which is adjacent to that of the Alice.
Let the score of the game be
∣A
i
−A
j
∣.
Alice wants to minimize the score while Bob wants to maximize the score . Determine the optimal score if they both play optimally.
Note that
∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of
X. For example,
∣4∣=4 and
∣−7∣=7.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the optimal score if both players play optimally.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alice will choose index
i=1 and Bob will choose index
j=2. Thus, the score is
∣A
1
−A
2
∣=∣1−1∣=0.
Test case
2: Alice will choose index
i=3 and Bob will choose index
j=2. Thus, the score is
∣A
3
−A
2
∣=∣3−2∣=1.
Test case
3: Alice will choose index
i=1 and Bob will choose index
j=2. Thus, the score is
∣A
1
−A
