You are given an array
A of
N integers, and an integer
X. For each
K in the range
[1,N], determine the number of ways to partition the array into exactly
K non-empty subarrays such that the maxima of each of the subarrays are at least
X.
The number of ways can be large, so output it modulo
998244353.
Note: The input and output are large, so use fast input-output methods.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers
and
X.
The second line consists of
N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing
N space-separated integers, the
i-th of which denotes the number of ways to partition the array into exactly
i non-empty subarrays such that the maxima of each of the
i subarrays are at least
X. Print the answer modulo
998244353.
