Almir had a small sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. He decided to make
K copies of this sequence and concatenate them, forming a sequence
X
1
,X
2
,…,X
NK
; for each valid
i and
j (
0≤j<K),
X
j⋅N+i
=A
i
.
For example, if
A=(1,2,3) and
K=4, the final sequence is
X=(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3).
A pair
(i,j), where
1≤i<j≤N, is an inversion if
X
i
>X
j
. Find the number of inversions in the final sequence
X.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of inversions in the sequence
X.
