There are
N cities numbered from
1 to
N, connected by
(N−1) roads such that every city is reachable from every other city (they form a tree structure). The
i
th
city has a population
P
i
.
Alice and Bob are initially standing at cities
A and
B respectively. They decide to play a game, such that, at every turn:
First, Alice makes a move by moving to some adjacent city unvisited by her (maybe visited by Bob).
Then, Bob moves to some adjacent city unvisited by him (maybe visited by Alice). Note that two cities are adjacent, if they are connected directly by a road.
Now, if the total population in Alice's path from
A to her current city is than that of Bob's path from
to his current city, Alice is awarded a point.
If both of them can make their next move the game continues, otherwise the game immediately ends.
Alice wants to maximise her score and Bob wants to minimise Alice's score. Find the final score of Alice if both play optimally.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of input contains three space-separated integers
N,
A, and
B — the number of cities, the initial cities in which Alice and Bob are standing.
The second line of input contains
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
, where
P
i
is the population of
i
th
city.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, defining that there is a road between city
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line, containing one integer, Alice's final score if both the players play optimally.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Let the total population covered by Alice is
X and by Bob be
Y.
Initially, Alice is at city
2 and Bob is at city
4, so
X=P
2
=1 and
Y=P
4
=2. Since
X≤Y, Alice does not get any point.
Now, Alice moves to city
3 and Bob moves to city
6, hence
X=X+P
3
=1+5=6 and
Y=Y+P
6
=2+3=5. Since
X>Y, Alice gets a point.
After this, neither Alice nor Bob has a possible move.
Thus, the final score of Alice is
1.
Test case
2: Initially both of them are standing at the city
1 and then move to the city
2. Thus, both of them cover the same population at each time. Hence, Alice does not get any points.
