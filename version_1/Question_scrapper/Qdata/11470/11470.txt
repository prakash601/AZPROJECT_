Miyako came to the flea kingdom with a ukulele. She became good friends with local flea residents and played beautiful music for them every day.
In return, the fleas made a bigger ukulele for her: it has
n
strings, and each string has
(1018+1)
frets numerated from
0
to
1018
. The fleas use the array
s1,s2,…,sn
to describe the ukulele's tuning, that is, the pitch of the
j
-th fret on the
i
-th string is the integer
si+j
.
Miyako is about to leave the kingdom, but the fleas hope that Miyako will answer some last questions for them.
Each question is in the form of: "How many different pitches are there, if we consider frets between
l
and
r
(inclusive) on all strings?"
Miyako is about to visit the cricket kingdom and has no time to answer all the questions. Please help her with this task!
Formally, you are given a matrix with
n
rows and
(1018+1)
columns, where the cell in the
i
-th row and
j
-th column (
0≤j≤1018
) contains the integer
si+j
. You are to answer
q
queries, in the
k
-th query you have to answer the number of distinct integers in the matrix from the
lk
-th to the
rk
-th columns, inclusive.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤100000
) — the number of strings.
The second line contains
n
integers
s1,s2,…,sn
(
0≤si≤1018
) — the tuning of the ukulele.
The third line contains an integer
q
(
1≤q≤100000
) — the number of questions.
The
k
-th among the following
q
lines contains two integers
lk
，
rk
(
0≤lk≤rk≤1018
) — a question from the fleas.
Output
Output one number for each question, separated by spaces — the number of different pitches.

strings are as follows.
Fret 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 …
s1: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 …
s2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 …
