You are playing EVE Online. Initially, you have one dollar, but you have somehow acquired two cheat codes. The first cheat code multiplies the amount of money you own by
10, while the second one multiplies it by
20. The cheat codes can be used any number of times.
You want to have exactly
N dollars. Now you are wondering: can you achieve that by only using some sequence of cheat codes?

T denoting the number of test cases. The description of

For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if you can make exactly
N dollars or "No" otherwise.
