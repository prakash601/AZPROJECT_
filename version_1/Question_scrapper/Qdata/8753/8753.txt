Recently, your friend discovered one special operation on an integer array
a
:
Choose two indices
i
and
j
(
i≠j
);
Set
ai=aj=|ai−aj|
.
After playing with this operation for a while, he came to the next conclusion:
For every array
a
of
n
integers, where
1≤ai≤109
, you can find a pair of indices
(i,j)
such that the total sum of
a
will decrease after performing the operation.
This statement sounds fishy to you, so you want to find a counterexample for a given integer
n
. Can you find such counterexample and prove him wrong?
In other words, find an array
a
consisting of
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) such that for all pairs of indices
(i,j)
performing the operation won't decrease the total sum (it will increase or not change the sum).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤1000
) — the length of array
a
.
Output
For each test case, if there is no counterexample array
a
of size
n
, print NO.
Otherwise, print YES followed by the array
a
itself (
1≤ai≤109
). If there are multiple counterexamples, print any.
Example
input
Copy
3
2
512
3
output
Copy
YES
1 337
NO
YES
31 4 159
Note
In the first test case, the only possible pairs of indices are
(1,2)
and
(2,1)
.
If you perform the operation on indices
(1,2)
(or
(2,1)
), you'll get
a1=a2=|1−337|=336
, or array
[336,336]
. In both cases, the total sum increases, so this array
a
is a counterexample.
