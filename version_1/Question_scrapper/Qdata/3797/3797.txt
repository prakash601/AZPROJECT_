Chef has two numbers
A and
B.
In one operation, Chef can choose either
A or
B and multiply it by
2.
Determine whether he can make both
A and
B equal after any number (possibly, zero) of moves.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can make both numbers equal, NO otherwise.
Note that the checker is case-insensitive i.e. YES, Yes, yes, yES are all considered same.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can multiply
A by
2 twice and both
A and
B will become
20.
Test case
2: Both numbers are already equal.
Test case
3: It can be shown that
A and
B cannot be made equal.
Test case
4: It can be shown that
A and
B cannot be made equal.
