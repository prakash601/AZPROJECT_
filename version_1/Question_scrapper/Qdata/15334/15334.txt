Furik loves math lessons very much, so he doesn't attend them, unlike Rubik. But now Furik wants to get a good mark for math. For that Ms. Ivanova, his math teacher, gave him a new task. Furik solved the task immediately. Can you?
You are given a system of equations:
You should count, how many there are pairs of integers (a, b) (0 ≤ a, b) which satisfy the system.
Input
A single line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the parameters of the system. The numbers on the line are separated by a space.
Output
On a single line print the answer to the problem.
