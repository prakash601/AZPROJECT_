Chef is again playing a game with his best friend Garry. As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.
First, they are given a stack of
N discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers
S of size
K. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer
1. In a move, a player can select any value
x from
S and pop exactly
x elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.
Scoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by
2
p
where
p is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers
p
1
,p
2
,p
3
,…,p
m
written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be
2
p
1
+2
p
2
+2
p
3
+⋯+2
p
m
.
The player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.
###Input:
First line contains
T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers
N and
K, denoting the size of the stack and the set S respectively.
Next line contains
N space separated integers
A
i
where
A
1
is the topmost element, denoting the initial arrangement of the stack.
The last line of each test case contains
K space separated integers each denoting
x
i
.
###Output: For each testcase, output "Chef" (without quotes) if Chef wins, "Garry" (without quotes) if Garry wins, otherwise "Draw" (without quotes) in a separate line.

###Sample Input: 1 3 2 5 7 1 1 2
###Sample Output: Chef
###Explanation: Chef can select 2 from the set and draw the top two discs (with integers 5 and 7 written on it) from the stack. Garry cannot select 2 from the set as there is only 1 disc left in the stack. However, he can select 1 from the set and pop the last disc.
So, Chef's score =
2

=
160
Garry's score =

=
2
Chef wins.
