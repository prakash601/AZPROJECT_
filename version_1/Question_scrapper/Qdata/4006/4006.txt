In order to establish dominance amongst his friends, Chef has decided that he will only walk in large steps of length exactly
K feet. However, this has presented many problems in Chef’s life because there are certain distances that he cannot traverse. Eg. If his step length is
5 feet, he cannot travel a distance of
12 feet. Chef has a strict travel plan that he follows on most days, but now he is worried that some of those distances may become impossible to travel. Given
N distances, tell Chef which ones he cannot travel.
###Input:
The first line will contain a single integer
T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case will contain two space separated integers -
N, the number of distances, and
K, Chef’s step length.
The second line of each test case will contain
N space separated integers, the
i
th
of which represents
D
i
, the distance of the
i
th
path.
###Output: For each testcase, output a string consisting of
N characters. The
i
th
character should be
1 if the distance is traversable, and
0 if not.
