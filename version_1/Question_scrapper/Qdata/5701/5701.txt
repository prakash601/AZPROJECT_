You are given an array
B containing
N integers, each of which is either
−1 or a non-negative integer. Construct any integer array
A of length
N such that:
0≤A
i
≤10
9
for every
1≤i≤N
If
B
i
≥0,
A must satisfy
mex(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
)=B
i
Otherwise,
B
i
=−1, which means there is no constraint on
mex(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
)
If there does not exist any array satisfying the constraints, print
−1 instead.
Note: The mex of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to it. For example,
mex(1,2,3)=0,mex(0,2,4,1)=3, and
mex(0,0,0)=1.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of
T testcases follows.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
N.
The second line of each testcase contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the required answer on a new line:
−1 if no valid array exists, or
N space-separated integers denoting the elements of any valid array
A. The elements of
A must satisfy
0≤A
i
≤10
9
.
Constraints
1≤T≤10

1≤N≤10

The sum of
N across all testcases won't exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
A=[1,3,0,4,2,6,5]. Let
C
i
=mex(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
). Then, it can be seen that
C=[0,0,2,2,5,5,7], which matches
B at all positions where
B
i
≥0.
Test case
2: It can be shown that no array
A exists that satisfies the given constraints.
