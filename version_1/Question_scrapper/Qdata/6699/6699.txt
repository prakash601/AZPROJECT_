Chef loves graphs. To express his love, he defines a function
f(G,x,y) for an undirected connected graph
G with weighted edges and two of its vertices
x,
y.
f(G,x,y) is defined as the minimum of weights of all paths in
G between the vertices
x and
y, where the weight of a path is the maximum of weights of edges in this path.
Chef has two connected graphs
G
1
and
G
2
. Each of these graphs has
N vertices (labelled
1 through
N) and
M edges. Calculate

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
M lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers
u,
v and
w denoting that vertices
u and
v in
G
1
are connected by an edge with weight
w.
M more lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers
u,
v and
w denoting that vertices
u and
v in
G
2
are connected by an edge with weight
w.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the sum
S modulo
998,244,353.
