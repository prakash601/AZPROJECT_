Chef Ada is training to defend her title of World Chess Champion.
To train her calculation skills, Ada placed a king on a chessboard. Remember that a chessboard has
8 rows and
8 columns (for the purposes of this problem, both the rows and the columns are numbered
1 through
8); let's denote the square in row
r and column
c by
(r,c). A king on a square
(r,c) can move to another square
(r
′
,c
′
) if and only if
(r
′
−r)
2
+(c
′
−c)
2
≤2.
Ada placed her king on the square
(R,C). Now, she is counting the number of squares that can be visited (reached) by the king in at most
K moves. Help Ada verify her answers.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
R,
C and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of squares the king can visit.
