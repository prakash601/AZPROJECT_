There is a competition with
N objective questions numbered
1 to
N.
Each question has
M options, out of which exactly one is correct.
Two friends Utkarsh and Tejas participate in the competition.
Neither of the participants know the correct answer to any question and thus, they make random guesses among the options.
The rules of the competition are as follows:
Game starts with Utkarsh.
Questions are asked in order
1 to
N.
Questions are thrown at a participant till he answers a question incorrectly.
Suppose a participant answers question
i incorrectly. Then, the turn will switch to the other participant and he will face the question
i.
Since he knows the option that was chosen in the earlier turns, he will be left with less options for question
i.
The participant who answers the question
N correctly, wins the competition.
Since it's Utkarsh's problem, he wants to know the probability with which he wins the competition.
The probability can be written in the form of
Q
P
such that
Q is not divisible by
998244353. Output the value of
P⋅Q
−1
mod
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers
N and
M, the number of questions and the number of options in each question.
Output Format
For each test case, output the probability with which Utkarsh wins the game.
The probability can be written in the form of
Q
P
such that
Q is not divisible by
998244353. Output the value of
P⋅Q
−1
mod
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one question with
3 options. Since Utkarsh goes first, the possibilities through which he can win are:
He answers it correctly, with a probability of
3
1
.
He answers it incorrectly, with a probability of
3
2
. Then, Tejas answers it incorrectly, with a probability of
2
1
. Then, since Utkarsh has only one option, which is the correct one, he answers it correctly.
Thus, the probability of Utkarsh winning is

Test case
2: There are two questions with
2 options each. Since Utkarsh goes first, the possibilities through which he can win are:
He answers the first question correctly with a probability of
2
1
and then answers the second one correctly with a probability of
2
1
.
He answers the first question incorrectly, with a probability of
2
1
. Then, Tejas answers it correctly.
Thus, Tejas gets the second question, which he answers incorrectly with a probability of
2
1
. Then, since Utkarsh has only one option, which is the correct one, he answers it correctly.
Thus, the probability of Utkarsh winning is
