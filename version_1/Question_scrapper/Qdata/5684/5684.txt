For a positive integer
m, let's define a function
f(m) as the sum of all perfect powers which divide
m. We call a positive integer
k a perfect power if there are integers
x and
y such that
k=x
y
and
y>1.
You need to calculate the sum
f(1)+f(2)+…+f(N). Since the answer might be quite big, compute it modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10
9
+7).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10
9
+7).

Explanation:
Example case 3: We have
f(4)=1+4=5, so
f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1+1+1+5=8.
