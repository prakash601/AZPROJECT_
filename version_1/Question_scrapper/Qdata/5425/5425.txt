Last week Penguin Charlie had a birthday. Chef presented him a string S.
Unfortunately, Charlie doesn't like string S, he likes string F. Charlie wants to create a few strings F from S by cutting. Cutting means getting some substrings from S that are equal to F and delete them from string S. After deleting a substring, the left and right parts of the resulting string remain separated. Note, a substring of a string S is a consecutive sequence of characters in S.
In some cases Charlie can still get substrings equal to F from the pieces that remain after cutting the original string. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to cut out at least one occurrence of the substring F in S. As this number may be too large, print it modulo 109 + 7.
  Input
Input begins with an integer T: the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a two lines with two strings: S, F.
Output
For each test case, output a single line indicating the number of ways Charlie can cut at least one occurrence of F from S modulo 109 + 7.

Example case 1.
chefand|charliethebest|
1 way to cut 1 string "charliethebest" from the string S:
Example case 2.
heknows|imeanit|yeahyouknow|imeanit|youknow
2 ways to cut 1 string "imeanit" from the string S - take one of them
1 way to cut 2 strings "imeanit" from the string S - take both:
Example case 3.
4 ways to cut 1 string "aa" from the string "aaaaa": |aa|aaa, a|aa|aa, aa|aa|a, aaa|aa|
3 ways to cut 2 strings "aa" from the string "aaaaa": |aa||aa|a, |aa|a|aa|, a|aa||aa|.
