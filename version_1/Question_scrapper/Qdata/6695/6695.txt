MoEngage has given you two trees
T
1
and
T
2
. Both trees have
N nodes and are rooted at node
1.
Definitions:
LCA
1
(u,v)= Lowest common ancestor of node
u and node
v in tree
T
1
.
LCA
2
(u,v)= Lowest common ancestor of node
u and node
v in tree
T
2
.
H
1
(v)= Number of nodes in the shortest path from node
1 to node
v in tree
T
1
. Note that,
H
1
(1)=1.
H
2
(v)= Number of nodes in the shortest path from node
1 to node
v in tree
T
2
. Note that,
H
2
(1)=1.
Find the maximum value of
H
1
(LCA
1
(u,v))+H
2
(LCA
2
(u,v)) over all pairs
(u,v) such that
u

=v.
More formally, find
1≤u<v≤N
max
[H
1
(LCA
1
(u,v))+H
2
(LCA
2
(u,v))].
Input Format
First line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of nodes.
Each of the next
(N−1) lines contain two integers
u and
v denoting an edge between nodes
u and
v in tree
T
1
.
Each of the next
(N−1) lines contain two integers
u and
v denoting an edge between nodes
u and
v in tree
T
2
.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line
1≤u<v≤N
max
[H
1
(LCA
1
(u,v))+H
2
(LCA
2
(u,v))].

Explanation:
Test case
1: The trees
T
1
and
T
2
are:
For
u=3 and
v=5,
LCA
1
(3,5)=3,
LCA
2
(3,5)=3,
H
1
(3)=2,H
2
(3)=3. Thus,
H
1
(LCA
1
(3,5))+H
2
(LCA
2
(3,5))=H
1
(3)+H
2
(3)=5.
It can be proven that
5 is the maximum possible answer for this case amongst all pairs
(u,v).
Test case
2: The trees
T
1
and
T
2
are:
For
u=2 and
v=4,
LCA
1
(2,4)=2,
LCA
2
(2,4)=1,
H
1
(2)=2,H
2
(1)=1. Thus,
H
1
(LCA
1
(2,4))+H
2
(LCA
2
(2,4))=H
1
(2)+H
2
(1)=3.
It can be proven that
3 is the maximum possible answer for this case amongst all pairs
(u,v).
