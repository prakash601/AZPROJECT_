Given an array of
n integers :
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
n
, find the longest size subsequence which satisfies the following property: The xor of adjacent integers in the subsequence must be non-decreasing.
###Input:
First line contains an integer
n, denoting the length of the array.
Second line will contain
n space separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.
###Output: Output a single integer denoting the longest size of subsequence with the given property.
###Constraints
n
0≤A
i
≤10
18
###Sample Input: 8 1 200 3 0 400 4 1 7
###Sample Output: 6
###EXPLANATION: The subsequence of maximum length is {1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 7} with Xor of adjacent indexes as {2,3,4,5,6} (non-decreasing)
