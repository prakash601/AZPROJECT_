For two given sequences of integers, find the longest possible integer sequence which is a subsequence of both these sequences, and whose elements are integers in a (strictly) increasing order.
Input
The first number is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), the length of the first sequence.
The next n integers are elements of the first sequence.
The next is m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5000), the length of the second sequence.
The next m integers are elements of the second sequence.
Output
On the first line, print a single number k, the length of the longest possible common subsequence that is increasing.
In the next line, print k space separated integers which is the answer. If there are multiple possible subsequences, any one would do.
