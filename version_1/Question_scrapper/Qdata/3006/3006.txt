Given two arrays A and B of positive integers of size N and M where N >= M, the task is to maximize the dot product by inserting zeros in the second array but you cannot disturb the order of elements.

Dot Product of array A and B of size N is A[0]*B[0] + A[1]*B[1]+....A[N]*B[N].
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, A[] = {2, 3, 1, 7, 8} 
 M = 3, B[] = {3, 6, 7}
Output: 107
Explanation: We get maximum dot product 
after inserting 0 at first and third 
positions in second array.
Maximum Dot Product : = A[i] * B[j] 
2*0 + 3*3 + 1*0 + 7*6 + 8*7 = 107
Example 2:
Input: N = 3, A[] = {1, 2, 3}
 M = 1, B[] = {4} 
Output: 12 
Explanation: We get maximum dot product
after inserting 0 at first and second
positions in second array. 
Maximum Dot Product : = A[i] * B[j] 
1*0 + 2*0 + 3*4 = 12

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maxDotProduct() which takes N, M, array A and B as input parameters and returns the maximum value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*M)

Constraints:
1 ≤ M ≤N ≤ 103
1 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤ 103
