You are given an array
A consisting of
N integers.
In one operation, you can:
Choose any two indices
i and
j
(i

=j);
Subtract
min(A
i
,A
j
) from both
A
i
and
A
j
. Note that
min(A
i
,A
j
) denotes the minimum of
A
i
and
A
j
.
Determine whether you can make all the elements of the array equal to zero in less than or equal to
N operations.
If it is possible to do so, output the required operations as well.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting number of elements in
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, if it possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero in less than or equal to
N operations, print
K+1 lines:
In the first line, print
K
(1≤K≤N), the required operations.
In each of the next
K lines, print two space-separated integers
i and
j, denoting the operation.
In case it is not possible to make all elements equal to
0, print a single line containing
−1.
Constraints
1≤T≤50
2≤N≤300
1≤A
i
≤300
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
600.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can pick
i=1 and
j=2 and subtract
min(A
1
,A
2
)=1 from both
A
1
and
A
2
. Thus, the final array is
[0,0].
Test case
2: It can be proven that there is no way to make all elements of the array equal to zero.
Test case
3: We can perform
2 operations in the following way:
Pick
i=1 and
j=3 and subtract
min(A
1
,A
3
)=1 from both
A
1
and
A
3
. Thus, the obtained array is
[0,3,0,3].
Pick
i=2 and
j=4 and subtract
min(A
2
,A
4
)=3 from both
A
2
and
A
4
. Thus, the obtained array is
[0,0,0,0].
