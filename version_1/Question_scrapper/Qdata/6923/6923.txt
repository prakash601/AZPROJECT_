You are given a tree with
N vertices numbered
1 through
N. For each valid
i, initially, vertex
i has value
W
i
. The value of each vertex can be either
−1 or a non-negative integer.
At any time, let's denote the sequence of values of vertices on the path from vertex
u to vertex
v by
S(u,v). We are interested in replacing each element
−1 in such a sequence by a non-negative integer (not necessarily the same for each
−1).
You should process
Q queries of five types:
UPDATE U X: Change the value of vertex
U to
X.
INCREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each
−1 in the sequence
S(U,V) by an integer such that the resulting sequence is strictly increasing and contains only integers between
A and
B (inclusive).
DECREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each
−1 in the sequence
S(U,V)by an integer such that the resulting sequence is strictly decreasing and contains only integers between
A and
B (inclusive).
NON-DECREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each
−1 in the sequence
S(U,V) by an integer such that the resulting sequence is non-decreasing and contains only integers between
A and
B (inclusive).
NON-INCREASING U V A B: Find the number of ways to replace each
−1 in the sequence
S(U,V) by an integer such that the resulting sequence is non-increasing and contains only integers between
A and
B (inclusive).
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
W

,W

,…,W
N
.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
U and
V denoting that vertices
U and
V are connected by an edge.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines describes one query in the format given above.
Output
For each query except the UPDATE queries, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to replace each
−1, modulo
