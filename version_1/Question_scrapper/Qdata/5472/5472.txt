Chef and his friend Chefu decided to go on a trip. The trip takes place over the next
N days (numbered 1 through
N). There are
K different places Chef and Chefu could visit (numbered 1 through
K). They have written a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
which denotes the plan of the trip during these
N days; however, the plan is not completed yet. For each valid
i, they want to visit the place
A
i
on the
i-th day, but if
A
i
=−1, then they haven't decided which place to visit on that day.
Chef and his friend do not want to visit the same place two days in a row, but they can visit a place more than once in total. It is not necessary to visit all the places during the trip. Determine whether it is possible to complete the plan in such a way that this condition is satisfied. If it is possible, find one way of completing the plan.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if it's possible the complete the plan or "NO" otherwise.
If it's possible to complete the plan, print a second line containing
N space-separated integers denoting the sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
after completing the plan. If there is more than one solution, you may print any one.
