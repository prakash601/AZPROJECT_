A snowflake graph is generated from two integers
x
and
y
, both greater than
1
, as follows:
Start with one central vertex.
Connect
x
new vertices to this central vertex.
Connect
y
new vertices to each of these
x
vertices.
For example, below is a snowflake graph for
x=5
and
y=3
.
The snowflake graph above has a central vertex
15
, then
x=5
vertices attached to it (
3
,
6
,
7
,
8
, and
20
), and then
y=3
vertices attached to each of those.
Given a snowflake graph, determine the values of
x
and
y
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤200
;
1≤m≤min(1000,
n(n−1)
2
)
) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
The next
m
lines each contain two integers each
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
,
u≠v
) — the numbers of vertices connected by an edge. The graph does not contain multiple edges and self-loops.
It is guaranteed that this graph is a snowflake graph for some integers
x
and
y
both greater than
1
.
Output
For each test case, on a separate line output the values of
x
and
y
, in that order, separated by a space.

The first test case is pictured in the statement. Note that the output 3 5 is incorrect, since
x
should be output before
y
.
