You have an array
P of length
N. Also in front of you, there are
N bags of gems lined up in a row where the
i-th bag from the left has
2
P
i
gems in it.
You can take any bags of gems from them following the given rules:
You are not allowed to take two adjacent bags.
You are allowed to take at most
k bags.
For each value of
k from
1 to
⌈
2
N
⌉, find the maximum number of gems you can obtain.
Since the answers may be too large, print them modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line contains
- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the number of bags of gems.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
⌈
2
N
⌉ integers. The
k-th of them is the maximum number of gems you can obtain if you take no more than
k bags, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test Case-1:
For
k=1: It is optimal to pick index:
2. Therefore the number of gems
=2
P
2
=8.
For
k=2: Optimal selection is exactly same.
Test Case-3:
For
k=1: It is optimal to pick indices:
3. Therefore the number of gems
=2
P
3
=16.
For
k=2: It is optimal to pick indices:
2,5. Therefore the number of gems
=2
