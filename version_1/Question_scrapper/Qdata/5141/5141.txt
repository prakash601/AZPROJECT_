Chef and his friend Bharat have decided to play the game "The Chefora Spell".
In the game, a positive integer
N (in decimal system) is considered a "Chefora" if the number of digits
d is odd and it satisfies the equation
N=∑
i=0
d−1
N
i
⋅10
i
,
where
N
i
is the
i-th digit of
N from the left in
0-based indexing.
Let
A
i
denote the
i-th smallest Chefora number.
They'll ask each other
Q questions, where each question contains two integers
L and
R. The opponent then has to answer with
(
(∏
i=L+1
R
(A
L
)
A
i
)mod10
9
+7.
Bharat has answered all the questions right, and now it is Chef's turn. But since Chef fears that he could get some questions wrong, you have come to his rescue!
