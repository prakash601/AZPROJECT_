Given a String. Reverse each word in it where the words are separated by dots.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "i.like.this.program.very.much"
Output: 
i.ekil.siht.margorp.yrev.hcum
Explanation: 
The words are reversed as
follows:"i" -> "i","like"->"ekil",
"this"->"siht","program" -> "margorp",
"very" -> "yrev","much" -> "hcum".
Example 2:
Input: 
S = "pqr.mno"
 
rqp.onm
Explanation: 
The words are reversed as
follows:"pqr" -> "rqp" ,
"mno" -> "onm"

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the functionreverseWords()which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by reversing all the words separated by dots.

Expected Time Complexity:O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space:O(|S|).

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
