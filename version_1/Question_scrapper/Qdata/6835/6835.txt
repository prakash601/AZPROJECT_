Chef has a string
S with length
N and integer
K. Let's consider all strings that can be obtained by erasing
K consecutive characters from the original string ― specifically, for each
i (
1≤i≤N−K+1), let
f(i) be the string that is obtained by erasing the characters at positions
i,i+1,…,i+K−1.
Consider a permutation
P of the integers
1 through
N−K+1. You need to find the lexicographically smallest permutation
P such that
f(P
i
)≤f(P
i+1
) for each
i (
1≤i≤N−K).
Since the length of this permutation can be too large, you should only compute its hash:
∑
N−K+1
P
⋅i modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains a single string
S with length
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the hash of the lexicographically smallest valid permutation.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
f(1) and
f(2) are both "a", the lexicographically smallest permutation is
P=[1,2]. The answer is
1⋅1+2⋅2=4.
Example case 2:
f(1) is "cde",
f(2) is "ade",
f(3) is "abe",
f(4) is "abc". The lexicographically smallest valid permutation is
P=[4,3,2,1] and the answer is
4⋅1+3⋅2+2⋅3+1⋅4=20.
