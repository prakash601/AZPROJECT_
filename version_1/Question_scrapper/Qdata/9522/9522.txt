You are given an array
a
of length
n
consisting of integers. You can apply the following operation, consisting of several steps, on the array
a
zero or more times:
you select two different numbers in the array
ai
and
aj
;
you remove
i
-th and
j
-th elements from the array.
For example, if
n=6
and
a=[1,6,1,1,4,4]
, then you can perform the following sequence of operations:
select
i=1,j=5
. The array
a
becomes equal to
[6,1,1,4]
;
select
i=1,j=2
. The array
a
becomes equal to
[1,4]
.
What can be the minimum size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) is length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum possible size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it.
