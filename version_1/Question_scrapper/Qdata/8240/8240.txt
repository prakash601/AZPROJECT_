For an array of non-negative integers
a
of size
n
, we construct another array
d
as follows:
d1=a1
,
di=|ai−ai−1|
for
2≤i≤n
.
Your task is to restore the array
a
from a given array
d
, or to report that there are multiple possible arrays.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the size of the arrays
a
and
d
.
The second line contains
n
integers
d1,d2,…,dn
(
0≤di≤100
) — the elements of the array
d
.
It can be shown that there always exists at least one suitable array
a
under these constraints.
Output
For each test case, print the elements of the array
a
, if there is only one possible array
a
. Otherwise, print
−1
.
Example
input
Copy

4
1 0 2 5
3
2 6 3
5
0 0 0 0 0
output
Copy
1 1 3 8
-1
0 0 0 0 0
Note
In the second example, there are two suitable arrays:
[2,8,5]
and
[2,8,11]
.
