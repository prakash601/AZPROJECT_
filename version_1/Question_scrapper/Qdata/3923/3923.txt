Chef has an array
A of length
N.
Chef forms a binary array
B of length
N using the parity of the sums of adjacent elements in
A. Formally,
B

Here
x%y denotes the remainder obtained when
x is divided by
y.
Chef lost the array
A and needs your help. Given array
B, determine whether there exits any valid array
A which could have formed
B.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
— the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
B

,…,B
N
denoting the array
B.
Output Format
For each testcase, output YES if there exists a valid array
A, NO otherwise.
You can print any character in any case. For example YES, Yes, yEs are all considered same.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case 1: One such valid array is
A=[3,3].
Test case 2: It can be shown that no such arrays exist and are valid.
Test case 3: One such valid array is
A=[1,2,4,5].
