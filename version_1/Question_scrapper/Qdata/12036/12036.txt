Polycarp has
n
coins, the value of the
i
-th coin is
ai
. It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of
2
(i.e.
ai=2d
for some non-negative integer number
d
).
Polycarp wants to know answers on
q
queries. The
j
-th query is described as integer number
bj
. The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value
bj
using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value
bj
, the answer to the
j
-th query is -1.
The queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — the number of coins and the number of queries.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
— values of coins (
1≤ai≤2⋅109
). It is guaranteed that all
ai
are integer powers of
2
(i.e.
ai=2d
for some non-negative integer number
d
).
The next
q
lines contain one integer each. The
j
-th line contains one integer
bj
— the value of the
j
-th query (
1≤bj≤109
).
Output
Print
q
integers
ansj
. The
j
-th integer must be equal to the answer on the
j
-th query. If Polycarp can't obtain the value
bj
the answer to the
j
-th query is -1.
