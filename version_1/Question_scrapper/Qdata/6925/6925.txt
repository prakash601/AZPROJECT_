Consider an array
A with
N positive integers.
Let
B be defined as an array of
N integers such that for each
1≤i≤N:
B
i
=A
i
−1, if
A
i
is even.
B
i
=A
i
+1, if
A
i
is odd.
You are given an array
C of size
2⋅N which is formed by taking all the elements of the arrays
A and
B and rearranging them. You need to find the number of distinct arrays
A whose sum of elements is
K, from which
C can be obtained.
Note: Two arrays
X and
Y are considered to be distinct if there exists no rearrangement of
X which is the same as
Y.
Since the final answer can be very large, print the answer modulo
.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K - the parameters mentioned in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains
2⋅N space-separated integers
C

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct arrays
A such that the sum of its elements is
K. Print the answer modulo (

Explanation:
Test case 1: If
A=[1,3], then
B=[2,4].
C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of
A and
B. It can be proven that
A=[1,3] is the only such distinct array whose elements sum to
4. Thus the answer is
1.
Note that arrays
[1,3] and
[3,1] are not distinct.
Test case 2:
If
A=[2,3], then
B=[1,4].
C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of
A and
B.
If
A=[1,4], then
B=[2,3].
C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of
A and
B.
It can be proven that
[2,3] and
[1,4] are the only such distinct arrays whose elements sum to
5. Thus the answer is
2.
