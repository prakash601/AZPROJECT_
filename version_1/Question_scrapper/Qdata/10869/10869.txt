There are
n
football teams in the world.
The Main Football Organization (MFO) wants to host at most
m
games. MFO wants the
i
-th game to be played between the teams
ai
and
bi
in one of the
k
stadiums.
Let
sij
be the numbers of games the
i
-th team played in the
j
-th stadium. MFO does not want a team to have much more games in one stadium than in the others. Therefore, for each team
i
, the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum among
si1,si2,…,sik
should not exceed
2
.
Each team has
wi
 — the amount of money MFO will earn for each game of the
i
-th team. If the
i
-th team plays
l
games, MFO will earn
wi⋅l
.
MFO needs to find what games in what stadiums they need to host in order to earn as much money as possible, not violating the rule they set.
However, this problem is too complicated for MFO. Therefore, they are asking you to help them.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
,
k
(
3≤n≤100
,
0≤m≤1000
,
1≤k≤1000
) — the number of teams, the number of games, and the number of stadiums.
The second line contains
n
integers
w1,w2,…,wn
(
1≤wi≤1000
) — the amount of money MFO will earn for each game of the
i
-th game.
Each of the following
m
lines contains two integers
ai
and
bi
(
1≤ai,bi≤n
,
ai≠bi
) — the teams that can play the
i
-th game. It is guaranteed that each pair of teams can play at most one game.
Output
For each game in the same order, print
ti
(
1≤ti≤k
) — the number of the stadium, in which
ai
and
bi
will play the game. If the
i
-th game should not be played,
ti
should be equal to
0
.
If there are multiple answers, print any.
