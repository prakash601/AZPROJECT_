Hossam gives you a sequence of integers
a1,a2,…,an
of length
n
. Moreover, he will give you
q
queries of type
(l,r)
. For each query, consider the elements
al,al+1,…,ar
. Hossam wants to know the smallest number in this sequence, such that it occurs in this sequence an odd number of times.
You need to compute the answer for each query before process the next query.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
), the length of the sequence.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
The third line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅105
), the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
a
and
b
(
0≤a,b≤2⋅109
), the numbers used to encode the queries.
Let
ansi
be the answer on the
i
-th query, and
ans0
be zero. Then
li=ai⊕ansi−1,
ri=bi⊕ansi−1,
where
li,ri
are parameters of the
i
-th query and
⊕
means the bitwise exclusive or operation. It is guaranteed that
1≤l≤r≤n
.
Output
For each query, print the smallest number that occurs an odd number of times on the given segment of the sequence.
If there is no such number, print
0
.
