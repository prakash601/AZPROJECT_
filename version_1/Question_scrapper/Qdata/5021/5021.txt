Chef has a string
S consisting only of English lowercase letters (a - z). However, Hitesh does not like it and wants it to be reversed.
Hitesh wonders what is the minimum number of operations required to reverse the string
S using the following operation:
Select any
i such that
1≤i≤∣S∣ and remove
S
i
from its original position and append it to the end of the string (i.e. shift any character to the end of the string).
For e.g. if
S= abcde and we apply operation on
i=2, then
S becomes acdeb.
Help Hitesh find the minimum number of operations required to reverse
S.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing the string S.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to reverse the string
S.
Constraints
