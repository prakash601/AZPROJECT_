You are given an array
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] of length
N.
You can right rotate it any number of times (possibly, zero). What is the maximum value of
A
1
+A
N
you can get?
Note: Right rotating the array
[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] once gives the array
[A
N
,A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N−1
]. For example, right rotating
[1,2,3] once gives
[3,1,2], and right rotating it again gives
[2,3,1].
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the length of array
.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum value of
A
1
+A
N
you can get after several right rotations.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Whether you right rotate the array or not, you will always end up with
A
1
+A
N
=13.
Test case
2: It is optimal to right rotate the array once after which the array becomes
[15,5,10] with
A
1
+A
N
=25.
Test case
3: No matter how much you right rotate the array, you will always obtain
A
1
+A
N
=8.
