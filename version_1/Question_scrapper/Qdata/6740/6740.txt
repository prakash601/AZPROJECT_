You are given a permutation
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
N
. Let's denote a contiguous subsequence
p
l
,p
l+1
,…,p
r
in it by
[l,r] and call it interesting if
max(p
l
,p
l+1
,…,p
r
)−min(p
l
,p
l+1
,…,p
r
)=r−l.
Next, let's say that two interesting subsequences
[a,b] and
[c,d] are nested if
a≤c≤d≤b or
c≤a≤b≤d, and they are interleaved if
max(a,c)≤min(b,d), but they are not nested. The intersection of two such interleaved subsequences is the subsequence
[max(a,c),min(b,d)].
You need to find the number of ordered pairs of interesting contiguous subsequences such that they are interleaved and their intersection contains at least
X elements. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
