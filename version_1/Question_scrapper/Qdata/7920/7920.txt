Given an array
a1,a2,…,an
, you need to handle a total of
q
updates and queries of two types:
1
 l
 r
 — for each index
i
with
l≤i≤r
, update the value of
ai
to the sum of the digits of
ai
.
2
 x
 — output
ax
.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
The next
q
lines of each test case are of two forms:
1
 l
 r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) — it means, for each index
i
with
l≤i≤r
, you should update the value of
ai
to the sum of its digits.
2
 x
(
1≤x≤n
) — it means you should output
ax
.
There is at least one query of the second type.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
The sum of
q
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output the answers of queries of the second type, in the order they are given.

Note
In the first test case, the following process occurs:
Initially,
a=[1,420,69,1434,2023]
.
The operation is performed for
l=2
,
r=3
, yielding
[1,6,15,1434,2023]
.
We are queried for
x=2
,
x=3
, and
x=4
, and output
6
,
15
, and
1434
.
The operation is performed for
l=2
,
r=5
, yielding
[1,6,6,12,7]
.
We are queried for
x=1
,
x=3
, and
x=5
, and output
1
,
6
, and
7
.
