Given elements as nodes of the two linked lists. The task is to multiply these two linked lists, say L1 and L2. 
Note: The output could be large take modulo 109+7.
Example:
Input:
2
2
3 2
1
2
3
1 0 0
2
1 0 
Output:
64
1000

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 32*2 = 64.
Testcase 2: 100*10 = 1000.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow, the first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the first linked list (L1). In the next line are the space-separated values of the first linked list. The third line of each test case contains an integer M denoting the size of the second linked list (L2). In the fourth line is space-separated values of the second linked list.
Output:
For each test case output will be an integer denoting the product of the two linked lists.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function multiplyTwoLists() which should multiply the given two linked lists and return the result.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, M <= 100
