You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers.
In one move, you can choose some index
i
(
1≤i≤n−2
) and shift the segment
[ai,ai+1,ai+2]
cyclically to the right (i.e. replace the segment
[ai,ai+1,ai+2]
with
[ai+2,ai,ai+1]
).
Your task is to sort the initial array by no more than
n2
such operations or say that it is impossible to do that.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤500
) — the length of
a
. The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤500
), where
ai
is the
i
-th element
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
500
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer: -1 on the only line if it is impossible to sort the given array using operations described in the problem statement, or the number of operations
ans
on the first line and
ans
integers
idx1,idx2,…,idxans
(
1≤idxi≤n−2
), where
idxi
is the index of left border of the segment for the
i
-th operation. You should print indices in order of performing operations.
