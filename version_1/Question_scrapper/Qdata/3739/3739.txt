Alex, Bob, and, Chef are standing on the coordinate plane. Chef is standing at the origin (coordinates
(0,0)) while the location of Alex and Bob are
(X
1
,Y
1
) and
(X
2
,Y
2
) respectively.
Amongst Alex and Bob, find out who is at a farther distance from Chef or determine if both are at the same distance from Chef.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
X
1
,Y
1
,X
2
, and
Y
2
— the coordinates of Alex and Bob.
For each test case, output on a new line:
ALEX, if Alex is at a farther distance from Chef.
BOB, if Bob is at a farther distance from Chef.
EQUAL, if both are standing at the same distance from Chef.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, Bob, BOB, bob, and bOB, are all considered identical.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alex is at a distance
1 from Chef while Bob is at distance
5 from Chef. Thus, Bob is at a farther distance.
Test case
2: Alex is at a distance
5 from Chef and Bob is also at distance
5 from Chef. Thus, both are at the same distance.
Test case
3: Alex is at a distance
10 from Chef while Bob is at distance
5 from Chef. Thus, Alex is at a farther distance.
