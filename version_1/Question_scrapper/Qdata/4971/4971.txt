You are given an array
A containing
N integers. A subsequence of this array is called good if all the elements of this subsequence are distinct.
Find the number of good non-empty subsequences of
A. This number can be large, so report it modulo
10
9
+7.
Note that two subsequences are considered different if they differ in the indices chosen. For example, in the array
[1,1] there are 3 different non-empty subsequences:
[1] (the first element),
[1] (the second element) and
[1,1]. Out of these three subsequences, the first two are good and the third is not.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the number of elements in
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
