There is a light source on the plane. This source is so small that it can be represented as point. The light source is moving from point
(a,sy)
to the
(b,sy)
(sy<0)
with speed equal to
1
unit per second. The trajectory of this light source is a straight segment connecting these two points.
There is also a fence on
OX
axis represented as
n
segments
(li,ri)
(so the actual coordinates of endpoints of each segment are
(li,0)
and
(ri,0)
). The point
(x,y)
is in the shade if segment connecting
(x,y)
and the current position of the light source intersects or touches with any segment of the fence.
You are given
q
points. For each point calculate total time of this point being in the shade, while the light source is moving from
(a,sy)
to the
(b,sy)
.
Input
First line contains three space separated integers
sy
,
a
and
b
(
−109≤sy<0
,
1≤a<b≤109
) — corresponding coordinates of the light source.
Second line contains single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — number of segments in the fence.
Next
n
lines contain two integers per line:
li
and
ri
(
1≤li<ri≤109
,
ri−1<li
) — segments in the fence in increasing order. Segments don't intersect or touch each other.
Next line contains single integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅105
) — number of points to check.
Next
q
lines contain two integers per line:
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤109
) — points to process.
Output
Print
q
lines. The
i
-th line should contain one real number — total time of the
i
-th point being in the shade, while the light source is moving from
(a,sy)
to the
(b,sy)
. The answer is considered as correct if its absolute of relative error doesn't exceed
10−6
.

Note
The 1-st point is always in the shade;
the 2-nd point is in the shade while light source is moving from
(3,−3)
to
(6,−3)
;
the 3-rd point is in the shade while light source is at point
(6,−3)
.
the 4-th point is in the shade while light source is moving from
(1,−3)
to
(2.5,−3)
and at point
(6,−3)
;
the 5-th point is in the shade while light source is moving from
(1,−3)
to
(2.5,−3)
and from
(5.5,−3)
to
(6,−3)
