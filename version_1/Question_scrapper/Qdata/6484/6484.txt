There is a slot machine with
N reels. Each reel has characters
a to
z in order.
The initial configuration of the machine is given by a string
S of length
N, i.e., initially, the
i
th
reel from the left reads the character
S
i
.
You can perform the following types of operations on the slot machine:
Type
1: Pick a reel
i and rotate it upwards. For example, if
S
i
reads
a, it becomes
b,
b becomes
c and so on (
z becomes
a).
Type
2: Pick a reel
i and rotate it downwards. For example, if
S
i
reads
b, it becomes
a,
c becomes
b and so on (
a becomes
z).
You are allowed to perform the type
1 operation at most
P times and the type
2 operation at most
Q times.
Find the lexicographically minimum possible configuration of the slot machine that can be obtained by performing the above operations optimally.
Note that string
X is lexicographically smaller than string
Y, if
X
i
<Y
i
, where
i is the first index where
X and
Y differ.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains
T, the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
N,
P, and
Q, the number of reels in the slot machine, the maximum number of type
1 operations allowed and the maximum number of type
2 operations allowed.
The second line of each test case contains
S, the initial configuration of the slot machine.
Output Format
For each test case, print the lexicographically minimum possible configuration of the slot machine that can be obtained by performing the above operations.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can perform type
1 operation on
S
3
=z and type
2 operations on
S
1
=b and
S
4
=o.
The result is
a
a
an
oka.
It can be proved that no other sequence of operations generates a configuration that is lexicographically smaller.
