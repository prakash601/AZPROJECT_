Suppose
a1,a2,…,an
is a sorted integer sequence of length
n
such that
a1≤a2≤⋯≤an
.
For every
1≤i≤n
, the prefix sum
si
of the first
i
terms
a1,a2,…,ai
is defined by
si=
i
∑
k=1
ak=a1+a2+⋯+ai.
Now you are given the last
k
terms of the prefix sums, which are
sn−k+1,…,sn−1,sn
. Your task is to determine whether this is possible.
Formally, given
k
integers
sn−k+1,…,sn−1,sn
, the task is to check whether there is a sequence
a1,a2,…,an
such that
a1≤a2≤⋯≤an
, and
si=a1+a2+⋯+ai
for all
n−k+1≤i≤n
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
(
1≤n≤105
) and
k
(
1≤k≤n
), indicating the length of the sequence
a
and the number of terms of prefix sums, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
k
integers
sn−k+1,…,sn−1,sn
(
−109≤si≤109
for every
n−k+1≤i≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case, we have the only sequence
a=[1,1,1,1,1]
.
In the second test case, we can choose, for example,
a=[−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3]
.
In the third test case, the prefix sums define the only sequence
a=[2,1,1]
, but it is not sorted.
In the fourth test case, it can be shown that there is no sequence with the given prefix sums.
