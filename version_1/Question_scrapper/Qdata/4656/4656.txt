We all know Gru loves Agnes very much. One day Agnes asked Gru to answer some of her queries. She lined up
N minions in a straight line from
1 to
N.
You are given an array
A which contains the height of minions. Agnes will ask him several queries. In each query, Gru has to tell whether the bitwise AND of
A[L…R] is EVEN or ODD. Since Gru is busy planning the biggest heist on Earth, he asks for your help.
###Input:
First line of the input contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case:-
First line contains an integer
N denoting the number of elements.
Second line contains
N spaced integer representing array elements.
Third line contains
representing number of query.
Next
Q lines contains two integer
L and
R as defined above.
###Output: For each query, output "EVEN" or "ODD" without quotes.

1 2 
1 5
3 4
ODD
EVEN
EVEN
Explanation:
For the first query, the bitwise AND of 1 and 3 is 1, which is Odd. Hence the first output is ODD.
For the third query, the bitwise AND of 2 and 4 is 0, which is Even. Hence the third output is EVEN.
