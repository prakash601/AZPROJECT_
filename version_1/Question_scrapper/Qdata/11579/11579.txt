You are given
q
queries in the following form:
Given three integers
li
,
ri
and
di
, find minimum positive integer
xi
such that it is divisible by
di
and it does not belong to the segment
[li,ri]
.
Can you answer all the queries?
Recall that a number
x
belongs to segment
[l,r]
if
l≤x≤r
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤500
) — the number of queries.
Then
q
lines follow, each containing a query given in the format
li
ri
di
(
1≤li≤ri≤109
,
1≤di≤109
).
li
,
ri
and
di
are integers.
Output
For each query print one integer: the answer to this query.
