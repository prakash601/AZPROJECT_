Tokitsukaze has a sequence with length of
n
. She likes gems very much. There are
n
kinds of gems. The gems of the
i
-th kind are on the
i
-th position, and there are
ai
gems of the same kind on that position. Define
G(l,r)
as the multiset containing all gems on the segment
[l,r]
(inclusive).
A multiset of gems can be represented as
S=[s1,s2,…,sn]
, which is a non-negative integer sequence of length
n
and means that
S
contains
si
gems of the
i
-th kind in the multiset. A multiset
T=[t1,t2,…,tn]
is a multisubset of
S=[s1,s2,…,sn]
if and only if
ti≤si
for any
i
satisfying
1≤i≤n
.
Now, given two positive integers
k
and
p
, you need to calculate the result of
n
∑
l=1
n
∑
r=l
∑
[t1,t2,⋯,tn]⊆G(l,r)
((
n
∑
i=1
ptit
k
i
)(
n
∑
i=1
[ti>0])),
where
[ti>0]=1
if
ti>0
and
[ti>0]=0
if
ti=0
.
Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
k
and
p
(
1≤n≤105
;
1≤k≤105
;
2≤p≤998244351
) — the length of the sequence, the numbers
k
and
p
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤998244351
) — the number of gems on the
i
-th position.
Output
Print a single integers — the result modulo
998244353
.
