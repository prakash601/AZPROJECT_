Along the railroad there are stations indexed from
1
to
109
. An express train always travels along a route consisting of
n
stations with indices
u1,u2,…,un
, where (
1≤ui≤109
). The train travels along the route from left to right. It starts at station
u1
, then stops at station
u2
, then at
u3
, and so on. Station
un
 — the terminus.
It is possible that the train will visit the same station more than once. That is, there may be duplicates among the values
u1,u2,…,un
.
You are given
k
queries, each containing two different integers
aj
and
bj
(
1≤aj,bj≤109
). For each query, determine whether it is possible to travel by train from the station with index
aj
to the station with index
bj
.
For example, let the train route consist of
6
of stations with indices [
3,7,1,5,1,4
] and give
3
of the following queries:
a1=3
,
b1=5
It is possible to travel from station
3
to station
5
by taking a section of the route consisting of stations [
3,7,1,5
]. Answer: YES.
a2=1
,
b2=7
You cannot travel from station
1
to station
7
because the train cannot travel in the opposite direction. Answer: NO.
a3=3
,
b3=10
It is not possible to travel from station
3
to station
10
because station
10
is not part of the train's route. Answer: NO.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) —the number of test cases in the test.
The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case is empty.
The second line of each test case contains two integers:
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤k≤2⋅105
) —the number of stations the train route consists of and the number of queries.
The third line of each test case contains exactly
n
integers
u1,u2,…,un
(
1≤ui≤109
). The values
u1,u2,…,un
are not necessarily different.
The following
k
lines contain two different integers
aj
and
bj
(
1≤aj,bj≤109
) describing the query with index
j
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
values over all test cases in the test does not exceed
2⋅105
. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of
k
values over all test cases in the test also does not exceed
2⋅105
Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:
YES, if you can travel by train from the station with index
aj
to the station with index
bj
NO otherwise.
You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).
