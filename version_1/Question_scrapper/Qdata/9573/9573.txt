There are
n
squares drawn from left to right on the floor. The
i
-th square has three integers
pi,ai,bi
, written on it. The sequence
p1,p2,…,pn
forms a permutation.
Each round you will start from the leftmost square
1
and jump to the right. If you are now on the
i
-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:
Jump to the
i+1
-th square and pay the cost
ai
. If
i=n
, then you can end the round and pay the cost
ai
.
Jump to the
j
-th square and pay the cost
bi
, where
j
is the leftmost square that satisfies
j>i,pj>pi
. If there is no such
j
then you can end the round and pay the cost
bi
.
There are
q
rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set
S
(initially it is empty). You must pass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set
S
for the
i
-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the
(i−1)
-th round.
For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
)  — the number of squares and the number of rounds.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p1,p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤n
). It is guaranteed that the sequence
p1,p2,…,pn
forms a permutation.
The third line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
The fourth line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
−109≤bi≤109
).
Then
q
lines follow,
i
-th of them contains a single integer
xi
(
1≤xi≤n
). If
xi
was in the set
S
on the
(i−1)
-th round you should remove it, otherwise, you should add it.
Output
Print
q
lines, each of them should contain a single integer  — the minimum cost you should pay to end the corresponding round.

Note
Let's consider the character
T
as the end of a round. Then we can draw two graphs for the first and the second test.
In the first round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is
{1}
. The path you can use is
1→3→T
and its cost is
6
.
In the second round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is
{1,2}
. The path you can use is
1→2→3→T
and its cost is
8
.
