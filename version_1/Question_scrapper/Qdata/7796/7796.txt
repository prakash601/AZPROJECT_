You are given a multiset
S
. Initially,
S={1,2,3,…,n}
.
You will perform the following operation
n−1
times.
Choose the largest number
Smax
in
S
and the smallest number
Smin
in
S
. Remove the two numbers from
S
, and add
Smax−Smin
into
S
.
It's easy to show that there will be exactly one number left after
n−1
operations. Output that number.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases. Their description follows.
For each test case, one single line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤109
) — the initial size of the multiset
S
.
Output
For each test case, output an integer denoting the only number left after
n−1
operations.

Note
We show how the multiset
S
changes for
n=4
.
Operation
1
:
S={1,2,3,4}
, remove
4
,
1
, add
3
.
Operation
2
:
S={2,3,3}
, remove
3
,
2
, add
1
.
Operation
3
:
S={1,3}
, remove
3
,
1
, add
2
.
Final:
S={2}
.
Thus, the answer for
n=4
is
2
.
