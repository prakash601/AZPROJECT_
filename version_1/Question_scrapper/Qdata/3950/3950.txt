You are given an integer
N.
Construct any permutation
A of
N integers such that the value
LCM(1+A
1
,2+A
2
,…,N+A
N
) is minimised.
Note:
LCM denotes the least common multiple of the integers.
A permutation of
N integers contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output a permutation that minimises the value
LCM(1+A
1
,2+A
2
,…,N+A
N
).
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤1000

Explanation:
Test case
1: The permutation for which the value is minimised is
[2,1]. The minimum value is
LCM(1+2,2+1)=LCM(3,3)=3.
