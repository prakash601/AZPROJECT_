After successfully defending her title of World Chess Champion, Ada noticed that she is lacking in rook endgames.
To improve her endgame skills, Ada placed
K kings on a chessboard with
N rows and
M columns, and now she is calculating the minimum number of rooks she must place on the board to satisfy the following conditions:
No king is attacked by a rook.
The kings are isolated, i.e. no king can reach another king without passing through a square attacked by a rook or capturing a rook.
Help Ada check her answers.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The next
N lines describe the chessboard. Each of these lines contains a string with length
M describing one row, where an empty square and a square containing a king are denoted by '.' and 'K' respectively.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum required number of rooks, or
−1 if it is impossible to place rooks in a way that satisfies all conditions.
Constraints
1≤T≤1,024
1≤N,M≤1,024
each string contains only characters '.' and 'K'
the sum of
N⋅M over all test cases does not exceed
1,024
