While discussing a proper problem A for a Codeforces Round, Kostya created a cyclic array of positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
. Since the talk was long and not promising, Kostya created a new cyclic array
b1,b2,…,bn
so that
bi=(aimodai+1)
, where we take
an+1=a1
. Here
mod
is the modulo operation. When the talk became interesting, Kostya completely forgot how array
a
had looked like. Suddenly, he thought that restoring array
a
from array
b
would be an interesting problem (unfortunately, not A).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤140582
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
0≤bi≤187126
).
Output
If it is possible to restore some array
a
of length
n
so that
bi=aimoda(imodn)+1
holds for all
i=1,2,…,n
, print «YES» in the first line and the integers
a1,a2,…,an
in the second line. All
ai
should satisfy
1≤ai≤1018
. We can show that if an answer exists, then an answer with such constraint exists as well.
It it impossible to restore any valid
a
, print «NO» in one line.
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).
