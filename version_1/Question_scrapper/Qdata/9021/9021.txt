A number
a2
is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers
a1
and
a3
, if the following condition holds:
a1+a3=2⋅a2
.
We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers
a1
,
a2
and
a3
as follows:
d(a1,a2,a3)=|a1+a3−2⋅a2|
.
Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers
a1
,
a2
and
a3
and he wants to minimize the arithmetic mean deviation
d(a1,a2,a3)
. To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose
i,j
from
{1,2,3}
such that
i≠j
and increment
ai
by
1
and decrement
aj
by
1
Help Jeevan find out the minimum value of
d(a1,a2,a3)
that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤5000)
 — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers
a1
,
a2
and
a3
(1≤a1,a2,a3≤108)
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum value of
d(a1,a2,a3)
that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.
Example

0
Note
Note that after applying a few operations, the values of
a1
,
a2
and
a3
may become negative.
In the first test case,
4
is already the Arithmetic Mean of
3
and
5
.
d(3,4,5)=|3+5−2⋅4|=0
In the second test case, we can apply the following operation:
(2,2,6)
decrement a1
→
increment a2
(1,3,6)
d(1,3,6)=|1+6−2⋅3|=1
It can be proven that answer can not be improved any further.
In the third test case, we can apply the following operations:
(1,6,5)
decrement a2
→
increment a3
(1,5,6)
decrement a2
→
increment a1
(2,4,6)
d(2,4,6)=|2+6−2⋅4|=0
