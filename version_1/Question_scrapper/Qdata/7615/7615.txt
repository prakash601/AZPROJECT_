There are
N boxes. Initially, each box contains one ball.
For each
K from
1 to
N, solve the following problem:
Choose a subset of boxes of size
K equiprobably at random, and place one additional ball in each chosen box.
Then again choose a subset of boxes of size
K equiprobably at random, and place one additional ball in each chosen box. This second choice is independent of the first.
What is the expected value of the product of the number of balls over all boxes? It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as
Q
P
for some integers
P,Q, where
Q is not divisible by
998244353. Output such value
0≤R<998244353, that
P≡QRmod998244353.

Explanation:
If
K=1, with probability
1/3 one box will have 3 balls and two boxes will have 1 ball, and with probability
2/3 two boxes will have 2 balls and one box will have 1 ball. Thus the answer is
1/3⋅(3⋅1⋅1)+2/3⋅(2⋅2⋅1)=11/3.
If
K=2, with probability
1/3 two boxes will have 3 balls and one box will have 1 ball, and with probability
2/3 two boxes will have 2 balls and one box will have 3 balls. Thus the answer is
1/3⋅(3⋅3⋅1)+2/3⋅(2⋅2⋅3)=11.
If
K=3, with probability 1 all three boxes will have 3 balls, thus the answer is
1⋅(3⋅3⋅3)=27.
