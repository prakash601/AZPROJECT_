Three software engineers are sitting in CCD , tackling a problem. These engineers have been hired by a bank and they need to solve this problem which is crucial for the efficient functioning of the banking processes. The problem is stated below:
You have to answer K queries. Each query is described by 4 integers: a, b, l, r
You have to find max( gcd(p,q) , such that a ≤ p ≤ b and l ≤ q ≤ r ). p and q are integers.
Input
The first line contains one integer: the number of queries, K.
The second line contains 4 integers: a,b,c,d respectively.
Output
The output should contain K integers , one for each query.
Constraints
1 ≤ K ≤ 6 x 105
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 106
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 106
min(r-l, b-a) ≤ 103
Example
Input:
1
40 43 11 13
Output:
6
Explanation
Taking p = 42 and q = 12 gives us gcd(42,12) = 6. This is the maximum possible, and hence is the answer.
