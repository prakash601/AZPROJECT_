This is an interactive problem.
The jury has a permutation
p
of length
n
and wants you to guess it. For this, the jury created another permutation
q
of length
n
. Initially,
q
is an identity permutation (
qi=i
for all
i
).
You can ask queries to get
qi
for any
i
you want. After each query, the jury will change
q
in the following way:
At first, the jury will create a new permutation
q′
of length
n
such that
q
′
i
=qpi
for all
i
.
Then the jury will replace permutation
q
with pemutation
q′
.
You can make no more than
2n
queries in order to quess
p
.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
Interaction
Interaction in each test case starts after reading the single integer
n
(
1≤n≤104
) — the length of permutations
p
and
q
.
To get the value of
qi
, output the query in the format
?
i
(
1≤i≤n
). After that you will receive the value of
qi
.
You can make at most
2n
queries. After the incorrect query you will receive
0
and you should exit immediately to get Wrong answer verdict.
When you will be ready to determine
p
, output
p
in format
!
p1
p2
…
pn
. After this you should go to the next test case or exit if it was the last test case. Printing the permutation is not counted as one of
2n
queries.
After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see documentation for other languages.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
104
. The interactor is not adaptive in this problem.
Hacks:
To hack, use the following format:
The first line contains the single integer
t
 — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer
n
 — the length of the permutations
p
and
q
. The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
 — the hidden permutation for this test case.

Note
In the first test case the hidden permutation
p=[4,2,1,3]
.
Before the first query
q=[1,2,3,4]
so answer for the query will be
q3=3
.
Before the second query
q=[4,2,1,3]
so answer for the query will be
q2=2
.
Before the third query
q=[3,2,4,1]
so answer for the query will be
q4=1
.
In the second test case the hidden permutation
p=[1,3,4,2]
.
Empty strings are given only for better readability. There will be no empty lines in the testing system.
