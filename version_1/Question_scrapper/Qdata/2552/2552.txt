Given two positive integers A and B, find GCD of A and B.

Example 1:
Input: A = 3, B = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3

Example 2:
Input: A = 1, B = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: GCD of 1 and 1 is 1

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function which takes two positive integers as input parameters and returns an integer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B)))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 109
