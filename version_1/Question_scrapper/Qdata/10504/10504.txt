You are given a sequence
b1,b2,…,bn
. Find the lexicographically minimal permutation
a1,a2,…,a2n
such that
bi=min(a2i−1,a2i)
, or determine that it is impossible.
Input
Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
).
The first line of each test case consists of one integer
n
 — the number of elements in the sequence
b
(
1≤n≤100
).
The second line of each test case consists of
n
different integers
b1,…,bn
 — elements of the sequence
b
(
1≤bi≤2n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
by all test cases doesn't exceed
100
.
Output
For each test case, if there is no appropriate permutation, print one number
−1
.
Otherwise, print
2n
integers
a1,…,a2n
 — required lexicographically minimal permutation of numbers from
1
to
2n
.
