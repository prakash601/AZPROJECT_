Given a permutation
P of size
N, an array
A of size
N can be generated using the following method:
If
P
i
>P
j
for all
(1≤j<i), set
A
i
=0;
Otherwise, set
A
i
=max(j) where
(1≤j<i) and
(P
j
>P
i
).
Unfortunately, we lost the permutation
P and some elements of the array
A.
The lost elements of the array
A are denoted as
A
i
=−1. These elements can be replaced with any non-negative integer.
Given an array
A with some lost elements, check whether there exists a permutation
P, such that, we can obtain the array
A from
P using the above method.
If at least one such permutations exist, print the lexicographically smallest permutation.
If no such permutation exists, print
−1 instead.
Note:
A permutation of size
N contains each element from
1 to
N exactly once.
Permutation
X is said to be lexicographically smaller than permutation
Y if:
X
i
<Y
i
;
X
j
=Y
j
for all
(1≤j<i).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of
A.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers:
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line:
If at least one such permutations exist, print the lexicographically smallest permutation.
If no such permutation exists, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
3 permutations which meet the condition
{[1,4,3,2,5],[2,4,3,1,5],[3,4,2,1,5]}.
The lexicographically smallest permutation is
[1,4,3,2,5]. The array
A is obtained as:
A
1
:
A
1
=0 as there exists no
j<1 for which
P
i
<P
j
.
A
2
: Since
P
2
>P
1
,
A
2
=0.
A
3
: We set
A
3
as the maximum
j such that
j<3 and
P
j
>P
3
. Thus,
A
3
=j=2.
A
4
: We set
A
4
as the maximum
j such that
j<4 and
P
j
>P
4
. Thus,
A
3
=j=3.
A
5
: Since
P
5
is greater than
P
1
,P
2
,P
3
, and
P
4
,
A
5
=0.
Test case
2: No permutation meets the condition.
Test case
3: No permutation meets the condition.
Test case
4: Since all elements of the array are missing, we can assume the elements.
Consider the array
[0,0,0,0]. The lexicographically smallest permutation using which the array
A can be generated is
[1,2,3,4].
