Only a few know that Pan and Apollo weren't only battling for the title of the GOAT musician. A few millenniums later, they also challenged each other in math (or rather in fast calculations). The task they got to solve is the following:
Let
x1,x2,…,xn
be the sequence of
n
non-negative integers. Find this value:
n
∑
i=1
n
∑
j=1
n
∑
k=1
(xi&xj)⋅(xj|xk)
Here
&
denotes the bitwise and, and
|
denotes the bitwise or.
Pan and Apollo could solve this in a few seconds. Can you do it too? For convenience, find the answer modulo
109+7
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) denoting the number of test cases, then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case consists of a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅105
), the length of the sequence. The second one contains
n
non-negative integers
x1,x2,…,xn
(
0≤xi<260
), elements of the sequence.
The sum of
n
over all test cases will not exceed
5⋅105
.
Output
Print
t
lines. The
i
-th line should contain the answer to the
i
-th text case.
