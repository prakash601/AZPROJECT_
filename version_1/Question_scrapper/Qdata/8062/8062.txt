Koxia and Mahiru are playing a game with three arrays
𝑎
,
𝑏
, and
𝑐
of length
𝑛
. Each element of
𝑎
,
𝑏
and
𝑐
is an integer between
1
and
𝑛
inclusive.
The game consists of
𝑛
rounds. In the
𝑖
-th round, they perform the following moves:
Let
𝑆
be the multiset
{
𝑎
𝑖
,
𝑏
𝑖
,
𝑐
𝑖
}
.
Koxia removes one element from the multiset
𝑆
by her choice.
Mahiru chooses one integer from the two remaining in the multiset
𝑆
.
Let
𝑑
𝑖
be the integer Mahiru chose in the
𝑖
-th round. If
𝑑
is a permutation
†
, Koxia wins. Otherwise, Mahiru wins.
Currently, only the arrays
𝑎
and
𝑏
have been chosen. As an avid supporter of Koxia, you want to choose an array
𝑐
such that Koxia will win. Count the number of such
𝑐
, modulo
998244353
.
Note that Koxia and Mahiru both play optimally.
†
A permutation of length
𝑛
is an array consisting of
𝑛
distinct integers from
1
to
𝑛
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
𝑛=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
𝑛
(
1≤𝑛≤
10
5
) — the size of the arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
𝑛
integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤𝑛
).
The third line of each test case contains
𝑛
integers
𝑏
1
,
𝑏
2
,…,
𝑏
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑏
𝑖
≤𝑛
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
𝑛
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
Output a single integer — the number of
𝑐
makes Koxia win, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, there are
6
possible arrays
𝑐
that make Koxia win —
[1,2,3]
,
[1,3,2]
,
[2,2,3]
,
[2,3,2]
,
[3,2,3]
,
[3,3,2]
.
In the second test case, it can be proved that no array
𝑐
makes Koxia win.
