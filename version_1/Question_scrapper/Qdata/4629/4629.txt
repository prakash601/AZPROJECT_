Given two positive integers
a and
b, we define
f(a,b)=lcm(a,b)−gcd(a,b), where
lcm denotes the lowest common multiple and
gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.
Chef has a positive integer
N. He wonders, what is the maximum value of
f(a,b) over all pairs
(a,b) such that
a and
b are positive integers, and
a+b=N?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T — the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum value of
f(a,b) that can be obtained while satisfying the conditions on
a and
b.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are two possible pairs of
(a,b):
(1,2) and
(2,1). For both of these pairs, we have
lcm(a,b)=2 and
gcd(a,b)=1, which gives
f(a,b)=1.
Test case
2: For
(1,3), we have
lcm(1,3)=3 and
gcd(1,3)=1, giving
f(1,3)=3−1=2. It can be shown that this is the maximum possible value of
f(a,b) that can be obtained while satisfying the above conditions.
Test case
3: For
(1,5), we have
lcm(1,5)=5 and
gcd(1,5)=1, giving
f(1,5)=5−1=4. It can be shown that this is the maximum possible value of
f(a,b) that can be obtained while satisfying the above conditions.
