Chef is given two integers
N and
M. Please help Chef find any connected undirected graph
G consisting of exactly
N vertices and
M edges, such that the number of bridges in
G is maximized (among all graphs with
N vertices and
M edges).
G cannot have self-loops or multiple edges.
If there is more than one connected undirected graph with the maximum number of bridges, you may print any one of them.
Note: A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each testcase consists of a single line of input, containing two integers
N,M - the number of vertices and edges of the graph you must construct.
Output Format
For each test case, output
M lines where the
i-th line contains two space-separated integers denoting the
i-th edge of the graph
G you constructed. The edges may be printed in any order, and for each edge the endpoints may be printed in any order.
Note that
G must not contain self-loops or multiple edges, and no other graph on
N vertices and
M edges can contain strictly more bridges than
G.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is exactly
1 bridge in the graph and it cannot be increased further.
Test case
2: Since
M=N−1 and we are required to output a connected graph, the graph will always be a tree and hence have
4 bridges. Any tree is acceptable here.
Test case
3: Since
M=N⋅(N−1)/2 our only choice is a complete graph, which has
0 bridges.
