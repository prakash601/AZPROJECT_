Chef bought a huge (effectively infinite) planar island and built
N restaurants (numbered
1 through
N) on it. For each valid
i, the Cartesian coordinates of restaurant
i are
(X
i
,Y
i
).
Now, Chef wants to build
N−1 straight narrow roads (line segments) on the island. The roads may have arbitrary lengths; restaurants do not have to lie on the roads. The slope of each road must be
1 or
−1, i.e. for any two points
(x
1
,y
1
) and
(x
2
,y
2
) on the same road,
∣x
1
−x
2
∣=∣y

−y
2
∣ must hold.
Let's denote the minimum distance Chef has to walk from restaurant
i to reach a road by
D
. Then, let's denote
a=max(D
,D
,…,D
); Chef wants this distance to be minimum possible.
Chef is a busy person, so he decided to give you the job of building the roads. You should find a way to build them that minimises
a and compute
a⋅
2
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
X
i
and
Y
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the minimum distance
a multiplied by
2
. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We should build roads described by equations
y−x+0.5=0 and
y−x−0.5=0.
Example case 2: We should build roads described by equations
y−x−1=0 and
y+x−1=0.
