The student council is preparing for the relay race at the sports festival.
The council consists of
n
members. They will run one after the other in the race, the speed of member
i
is
si
. The discrepancy
di
of the
i
-th stage is the difference between the maximum and the minimum running speed among the first
i
members who ran. Formally, if
ai
denotes the speed of the
i
-th member who participated in the race, then
di=max(a1,a2,…,ai)−min(a1,a2,…,ai)
.
You want to minimize the sum of the discrepancies
d1+d2+⋯+dn
. To do this, you are allowed to change the order in which the members run. What is the minimum possible sum that can be achieved?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2000
)  — the number of members of the student council.
The second line contains
n
integers
s1,s2,…,sn
(
1≤si≤109
)  – the running speeds of the members.
Output
Print a single integer  — the minimum possible value of
d1+d2+⋯+dn
after choosing the order of the members.

Note
In the first test case, we may choose to make the third member run first, followed by the first member, and finally the second. Thus
a1=2
,
a2=3
, and
a3=1
. We have:
d1=max(2)−min(2)=2−2=0
.
d2=max(2,3)−min(2,3)=3−2=1
.
d3=max(2,3,1)−min(2,3,1)=3−1=2
.
The resulting sum is
d1+d2+d3=0+1+2=3
. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a smaller value.
In the second test case, the only possible rearrangement gives
d1=0
, so the minimum possible result is
0
.
