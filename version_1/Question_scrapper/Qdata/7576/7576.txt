After getting lost in Hollywood, ibti decided to give you yet another problem related to permutations.
Consider a permutation
P of length
2⋅N.
An array
A of size
N is generated using the permutation
P, such that the
i
th
element of the array is a pair having value,
A
i
=(P
i
modN,P
(i+N)
modN).
The permutation
P (of length
2⋅N) is called
N-beautiful, if, all elements of the array
A are distinct.
Given integers
K and
M, your task is to count the number of
i-beautiful permutations for each
1≤i≤K.
Since the answers can be large, print them modulo
M.
Input Format
The first and only line of the input contains two space-separated integers
K,
M - the parameters defined in the statement.
Output Format
Print
K space-separated integers, the
i
th
integer will denote the number of
i-beautiful permutations modulo
M.

Explanation:
All permutations of length
2 are
1-beautiful, thus the first value we print is
2!=2.
There are
16
2-beautiful permutations out of the
24 possible permutations. The
8 non-beautiful permutations are:
{1,3,2,4},{1,3,4,2},{2,4,1,3},{2,4,3,1},{3,1,2,4},{3,1,4,2},{4,2,1,3},{4,2,3,1}
For example, the permutation
{1,3,2,4} is not beautiful as
A=[(1mod2,2mod2),(3mod2,4mod2)]=[(1,0),(1,0)]. Both elements of the array
A are same.
