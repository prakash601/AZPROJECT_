Given a height h, count the maximum number of balanced binary trees possible with height h. Print the result modulo 109 + 7.
Note : A balanced binary tree is one in which for every node, the difference between heights of left and right subtree is not more than 1.

Example 1:
Input: h = 2
Output: 3 
Explanation: The maximum number of balanced 
binary trees possible with height 2 is 3.

Example 2:
Input: h = 3
Output: 15
: The maximum number of balanced
binary trees possible with height 3 is 15.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function countBT() which takes h as input parameter and returns the maximum number of balanced binary trees possible with height h. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(h)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(h)

Constraints:
1<= n <=103
