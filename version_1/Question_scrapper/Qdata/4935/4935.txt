Chef has two integers
A and
B. He can perform the following operation on
A an arbitrary number of times (including zero):
write
A as a binary number with an arbitrary number of leading zeroes (possibly without any)
shuffle the binary digits of
A in an arbitrary way, obtaining a number
s
replace
A by
s+1
Chef is wondering about the minimum number of operations he has to perform on
A in order to obtain
B. Compute this number or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
A and
B.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations or
−1 if it is impossible to obtain
B from
A.

Explanation:
Example case 1: One optimal solution is to not shuffle anything, so Chef just adds
1 twice.
Example case 2: We can obtain
5 from
1 in one operation.
