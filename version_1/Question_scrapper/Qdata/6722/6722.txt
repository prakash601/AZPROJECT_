Consider an
N×M binary matrix
A, i.e. a grid consisting of
N rows numbered
1 to
N from top to bottom and
M columns numbered
1 to
M from left to right, whose cells take the value
0 or
1. Let
(i,j) denote the cell on the
i-th row and
j-th column.
The matrix is said to be special if for every cell
(i,j), the following condition holds simultaneously:
A
i,j
=1 if and only if the sum of row
i is equal to the sum of column
j. More formally,
A
i,j
=1 iff
k=1
∑
M
A
i,k
=
k=1
∑
N
A
k,j
The specialty of a special matrix is defined to be the sum of values of all cells in the matrix. Given
N and
M, find the minimum specialty of a special matrix among all binary matrices consisting of
N rows and
M columns.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing
N and
M — the number of rows and the number of columns.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum specialty of a special matrix among all special binary matrices consisting of
N rows and
M columns.
