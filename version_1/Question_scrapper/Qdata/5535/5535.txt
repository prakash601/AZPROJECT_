Chef calls a pair of integers
(A,B) equivalent if there exist some positive integers
X and
Y such that
A
X
=B
Y
.
Given
A and
B, determine whether the pair is equivalent or not.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
A and
B, as mentioned in statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if
(A,B) is an equivalent pair, NO otherwise.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings Yes, YES, yes, and yeS are all considered identical.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are no positive integers
X and
Y which satisfy
A
X
=B
Y
.
Test case
2: Let
X=2 and
Y=3. Thus,
A
X
=8
2
=64 and
B
Y
=4
3
=64. Thus, the pair
(8,4) is equivalent.
Test case
3: There are no positive integers
X and
Y which satisfy
A
X
=B
Y
.
