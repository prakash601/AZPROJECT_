An array is called lovely if the sum of absolute differences of each adjacent pair of elements is odd; formally, the array
S of size
m is lovely if
∑
i=1
m−1
∣S
i
−S
i+1
∣ is odd.
You are given an array
A of
N integers. You need to reorder the array in any manner such that the array becomes lovely. If there is no reordering operation that makes the array lovely, output -1.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N integers denoting the modified array which is lovely, or -1 if it is not possible.

Explanation:
For the first test case, the sum is
∣1−2∣+∣2−3∣+∣3−10∣+∣10−7∣+∣7−12∣=1+1+7+3+5=17 which is odd.
For the second test case,
∣1−3∣=2 which is even. There is no array that can satisfy the above condition.
