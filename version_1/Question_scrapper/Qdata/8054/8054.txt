Hossam has an unweighted tree
𝐺
with letters in vertices.
Hossam defines
𝑠(𝑣,𝑢)
as a string that is obtained by writing down all the letters on the unique simple path from the vertex
𝑣
to the vertex
𝑢
in the tree
𝐺
.
A string
𝑎
is a subsequence of a string
𝑠
if
𝑎
can be obtained from
𝑠
by deletion of several (possibly, zero) letters. For example, "dores", "cf", and "for" are subsequences of "codeforces", while "decor" and "fork" are not.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, "abacaba" is a palindrome, but "abac" is not.
Hossam defines a sub-palindrome of a string
𝑠
as a subsequence of
𝑠
, that is a palindrome. For example, "k", "abba" and "abhba" are sub-palindromes of the string "abhbka", but "abka" and "cat" are not.
Hossam defines a maximal sub-palindrome of a string
𝑠
as a sub-palindrome of
𝑠
, which has the maximal length among all sub-palindromes of
𝑠
. For example, "abhbka" has only one maximal sub-palindrome — "abhba". But it may also be that the string has several maximum sub-palindromes: the string "abcd" has
4
maximum sub-palindromes.
Help Hossam find the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all
𝑠(𝑣,𝑢)
in the tree
𝐺
.
Note that the sub-palindrome is a subsequence, not a substring.
Input
The first line contains one integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤200
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has one integer number
𝑛
(
1≤𝑛≤2⋅
10
3
) — the number of vertices in the graph.
The second line contains a string
𝑠
of length
𝑛
, the
𝑖
-th symbol of which denotes the letter on the vertex
𝑖
. It is guaranteed that all characters in this string are lowercase English letters.
The next
𝑛−1
lines describe the edges of the tree. Each edge is given by two integers
𝑣
and
𝑢
(
1≤𝑣,𝑢≤𝑛
,
𝑣≠𝑢
). These two numbers mean that there is an edge
(𝑣,𝑢)
in the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that sum of all
𝑛
doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
3
.
Output
For each test case output one integer — the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all
𝑠(𝑣,𝑢)
.
