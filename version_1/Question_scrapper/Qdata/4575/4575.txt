Alice has a very complex machine ― when fed with a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, it produces a sequence
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
, where for each valid
i,
B
i
is the largest index
j such that
A
i
divides
A
j
(since
A
i
divides itself, such an index always exist). For example, if the machine is fed with
A=[2,6,5,3,4], it produces
B=[5,2,3,4,5].
Alice gave you a sequence
B that was produced by the machine. Find an integer sequence
A such that when it is fed into the machine, then the machine produces the sequence
B. Alice does not like huge integers, so make sure that
1≤A
i
≤4⋅10
6
holds for each valid
i.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. For each valid
i,
1≤A
i
≤4⋅10
6
should hold.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.
