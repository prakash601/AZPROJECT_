Chef goes to the supermarket to buy some items. Luckily there's a sale going on under which Chef gets the following offer:
If Chef buys
3 items then he gets the item (out of those
3 items) having the lowest price as free.
For e.g. if Chef bought
3 items with the cost
6,
2 and
4, then he would get the item with cost
2 as free. So he would only have to pay the cost of the other two items which will be
6+4=10.
Chef buys

A,
B and
C respectively. What is the amount of money Chef needs to pay?
