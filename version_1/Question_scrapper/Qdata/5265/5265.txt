You are given two positive integers
a and
b. You also have a number
x, which is initially set to
0. At first, you can add
a to
x any number of times. After that, you can divide
x by
b any number of times as long as
x is divisible by
b.
Print YES if you can make
x equal to
1, otherwise print NO.
Input Format
First line of input will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line, two positive integers
a,b.
Output Format
For each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to make
x , or NO if it is not possible to do so.
Output is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable.

Explanation:
Test case
2: We initially have
x set to
0. Add
a=9 to
x for
4 times to make
x equal to
36. And then divide
x by
b=6 for
2 times to make
x equal to
1.
Test case
4: We initially have
x set to
0. Add
a=8 to
x for
18 times to make
x equal to
144. And then divide
x by
b=12 for
2 times to make
x equal to
1.
