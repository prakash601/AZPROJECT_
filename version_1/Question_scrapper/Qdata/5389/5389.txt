You are given an array
A consisting of
N integers and
Q queries. Each query is described by two integers
L and
R. For each query, output the number of tuples
(i,j,k) such that
L≤i<j<k≤R and
A
i
+A
j
+A
k
is an even number.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
Q.
The next line contains
integers
1
N
.
Then
Q lines follow, each containing two integers
L
i
and
R
i
.
Output Format
For each query, output the number of tuples possible as mentioned in the problem statement.
