Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random trees as birthday presents, but this time she received a tree as a present for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with this tree, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her this problem.
You are given a tree with
N vertices and weighted edges. It is rooted at vertex
1.
Define
g(u,v) to be the maximum weight of an edge on the shortest path between vertex
u and vertex
v in this tree.
Just calculating
g(u,v) is too easy, so you have to process
Q queries.
In each query, you are given
K distinct vertices
v
1
,v
2
,…,v
K
. You have to compute the sum of the
g-values of each pair of vertices among these
K, i.e, the value
∑
i=1
K−1
∑
j=i+1
K
g(v
i
,v
j
)
Note: The input and output are large, so use fast input-output methods.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q, denoting the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries respectively.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
P
2
,P
3
,…,P
N
, where
P
i
is the parent of vertex
i.
The third line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
W
2
,W
3
,…,W
N
, where
W
i
is the weight of the edge between vertices
i and
P
i
.
The next
Q lines contain queries you will have to answer. The description of
Q queries follows.
The
i-th line contains an integer
K
i
followed by
K
i
distinct space-separated integers
v
1
,v
2
,…,v
K
i
, where
K
i
is the number of vertices in this query and
v
1
,v
2
,…v
K
i
denote the vertices themselves.
Output Format
For each test, print one line containing
Q space-separated integers. The
i-th of these integers should be the answer to the
i-th query.

Explanation:
In the second sample:
Let's look at different values of
g(u,v) for this tree.
For the first query,
g(1,4)=40,
g(1,5)=50,
g(1,6)=60,
g(4,5)=50,
g(4,6)=60,
g(5,6)=60. The sum of all these values is
320.
For the second query,
g(2,3)=30,
g(2,7)=70,
g(2,8)=80,
g(3,7)=70,
g(3,8)=80,
g(7,8)=80. The sum of all these values is
410.
Note: The second sample does not satisfy the constraint
K
i
≥10, so it won't be present in the actual test data. It's added here only for illustration.
