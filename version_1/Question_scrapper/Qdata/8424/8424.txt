This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the versions is the constraints on
n
,
k
,
ai
, and the sum of
n
over all test cases. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
Note the unusual memory limit.
You are given an array of integers
a1,a2,…,an
of length
n
, and an integer
k
.
The cost of an array of integers
p1,p2,…,pn
of length
n
is
max
1≤i≤n
(⌊
ai
pi
⌋)−
min
1≤i≤n
(⌊
ai
pi
⌋).
Here,
⌊
x
y
⌋
denotes the integer part of the division of
x
by
y
. Find the minimum cost of an array
p
such that
1≤pi≤k
for all
1≤i≤n
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤a1≤a2≤…≤an≤105
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible cost of an array
p
satisfying the condition above.

Note
In the first test case, the optimal array is
p=[1,1,1,2,2]
. The resulting array of values of
⌊
ai
pi
⌋
is
[4,5,6,4,5]
. The cost of
p
is
max
1≤i≤n
(⌊
ai
pi
⌋)−
min
1≤i≤n
(⌊
ai
pi
⌋)=6−4=2
. We can show that there is no array (satisfying the condition from the statement) with a smaller cost.
In the second test case, one of the optimal arrays is
p=[12,12,12,12,12]
, which results in all
⌊
ai
pi
⌋
being
0
.
In the third test case, the only possible array is
p=[1,1,1]
.
