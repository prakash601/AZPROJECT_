Chef Avi likes the number
K. Given a list of
N integers, help him find the sum of all distinct numbers repeating exactly
K times. Each of those numbers should be considered only once in the sum, not
K times.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines:
The first line contains two space-separated integers
N,K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers.
Output Format
For each testcase, print the sum of all numbers occurring exactly
K times. If there is no such number, print -1 instead.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The numbers 2 and 3 occur exactly once. So the answer is 2 + 3 = 5.
Test Case 2: The number 9 occurs exactly three times. So the answer is 9.
Test Case 3: There is no number which occurs exactly once. Hence the answer is -1.
