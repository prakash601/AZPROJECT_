Chef had a sequence
S
0
,S
1
,…,S
N−1
; each element of this sequence was an integer between
0 and
N−1 (inclusive). Unfortunately, he forgot some (possibly zero or all) elements of this sequence. You are given a sequence
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
, where for each valid
i,
A
i
=−1 denotes an element Chef forgot and if
A
i

=−1, then
A
i
=S
i
.
Before Chef forgot any elements of
S, he created a sequence
B
0
,B
1
,…,B
N−1
, where for each valid
i,
B
i
is the number of occurrences of the value
i in
S (the number of valid indices
j such that
S
j
=i), and then, he created a third sequence
G
0
,G
1
,…,G
N
, where for each valid
i,
G
i
is the number of occurrences of the value
i in
B. (Note that the elements of
B are between
0 and
N inclusive.) Unfortunately, Chef also forgot the sequence
B, but he remembers
G.
Help Chef restore the missing elements of the sequence
S. Precisely, find the lexicographically smallest sequence
S which is consistent with all the given information or determine that there is no such sequence.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
.
The third line contains
N+1 space-separated integers
G
0
,G
1
,…,G
N
.
Output
For each test case:
If there is no sequence
S consistent with all the given information, print a single line containing the string "impossible".
Otherwise, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
S
0
,S
1
,…,S
N−1
- the lexicographically smallest valid sequence
S.
