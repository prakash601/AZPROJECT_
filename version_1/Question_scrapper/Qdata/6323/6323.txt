You are given a tree with
N nodes where each node is numbered from
1 to
N.
Suppose you root the tree at node
R.
Then, the score of a permutation
P of length
N is defined as the size of the set
S containing
LCA(P
i
,P
i+1
) for all
1≤i<N.
Find the minimum score of a permutation over all possible roots and all possible permutations of length
N.
You need to print the root
R and the permutation
P which results in the minimum score.
In case there are multiple answers, you may print any.
Note:
A permutation
P of length
N consists of all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
LCA(A,B) denotes the lowest common ancestor of nodes
A and
B.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test contains an integer
N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
The next
N−1 lines contain two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between the nodes
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print two lines.
In the first line, output
R, the root for which a permutation has minimum score.
In the second line, print
N space separated integers, denoting the permutation with minimum score.
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider
R=2 and
P=[1,2]. Thus,
S={LCA(1,2)}={2}.
Thus, the score is
∣S∣=1, which is minimum possible.
Test case
2: Consider
R=3 and
P=[1,5,3,2,4]. Thus,
S={LCA(1,5),LCA(5,3),LCA(3,2),LCA(2,4)}={3}.
Thus, the score is
∣S∣=1, which is minimum possible.
