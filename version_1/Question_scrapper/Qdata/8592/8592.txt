Tokitsukaze has two colorful tapes. There are
n
distinct colors, numbered
1
through
n
, and each color appears exactly once on each of the two tapes. Denote the color of the
i
-th position of the first tape as
cai
, and the color of the
i
-th position of the second tape as
cbi
.
Now Tokitsukaze wants to select each color an integer value from
1
to
n
, distinct for all the colors. After that she will put down the color values in each colored position on the tapes. Denote the number of the
i
-th position of the first tape as
numai
, and the number of the
i
-th position of the second tape as
numbi
.
For example, for the above picture, assuming that the color red has value
x
(
1≤x≤n
), it appears at the
1
-st position of the first tape and the
3
-rd position of the second tape, so
numa1=numb3=x
.
Note that each color
i
from
1
to
n
should have a distinct value, and the same color which appears in both tapes has the same value.
After labeling each color, the beauty of the two tapes is calculated as
n
∑
i=1
|numai−numbi|.
Please help Tokitsukaze to find the highest possible beauty.
Input
The first contains a single positive integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the number of colors.
The second line contains
n
integers
ca1,ca2,…,can
(
1≤cai≤n
) — the color of each position of the first tape. It is guaranteed that
ca
is a permutation.
The third line contains
n
integers
cb1,cb2,…,cbn
(
1≤cbi≤n
) — the color of each position of the second tape. It is guaranteed that
cb
is a permutation.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the highest possible beauty.

Note
An optimal solution for the first test case is shown in the following figure:
The beauty is
|4−3|+|3−5|+|2−4|+|5−2|+|1−6|+|6−1|=18
.
An optimal solution for the second test case is shown in the following figure:
The beauty is
|2−2|+|1−6|+|3−3|+|6−1|+|4−4|+|5−5|=10
