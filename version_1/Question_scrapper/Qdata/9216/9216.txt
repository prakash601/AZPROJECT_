Mocha wants to be an astrologer. There are
n
stars which can be seen in Zhijiang, and the brightness of the
i
-th star is
ai
.
Mocha considers that these
n
stars form a constellation, and she uses
(a1,a2,…,an)
to show its state. A state is called mathematical if all of the following three conditions are satisfied:
For all
i
(
1≤i≤n
),
ai
is an integer in the range
[li,ri]
.
n
∑
i=1
ai≤m
.
gcd(a1,a2,…,an)=1
.
Here,
gcd(a1,a2,…,an)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
a1,a2,…,an
.
Mocha is wondering how many different mathematical states of this constellation exist. Because the answer may be large, you must find it modulo
998244353
.
Two states
(a1,a2,…,an)
and
(b1,b2,…,bn)
are considered different if there exists
i
(
1≤i≤n
) such that
ai≠bi
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤50
,
1≤m≤105
) — the number of stars and the upper bound of the sum of the brightness of stars.
Each of the next
n
lines contains two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤m
) — the range of the brightness of the
i
-th star.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of different mathematical states of this constellation, modulo
998244353
.
