Given an array arr[] of N integers arranged in a circular fashion. Your task is to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {8,-8,9,-9,10,-11,12}
Output:
22
Explanation:
Starting from the last element
of the array, i.e, 12, and 
moving in a circular fashion, we 
have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, 
-9, 10, which gives maximum sum 
as 22.
Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {10,-3,-4,7,6,5,-4,-1}
Output:
23
Explanation: Sum of the circular 
subarray with maximum sum is 23

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function circularSubarraySum() which returns a sum of the circular subarray with maximum sum.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
-106 <= Arr[i] <= 106
