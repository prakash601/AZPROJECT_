Given a string S contains 0's, 1's, and 2's, the task is to find the number of goals on the penalty.
 '1' stands for "goal".
 '0' stands for "no goal".
 '2' stands for a foul which gives a penalty.
Example 1:
Input: S = "1012012112110"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 penalties,
of which he scores only 2.
1012012112110
Example 2:
Input: S = "111122"
 0
 No goal on penalty
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function penaltyScore() which takes a string S as input and returns the goals count on the penalty.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= |N| <= 105
