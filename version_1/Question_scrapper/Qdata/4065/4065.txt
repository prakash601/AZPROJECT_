Today is Chef's birthday and he is looking forward to his gift. As usual, the gift is hidden and Chef has to follow a sequence of
N instructions to reach it.
Initially, Chef is standing in the cell
(0,0) of a two-dimensional grid. The sequence of instructions is given as a string
S. If we denote Chef's current cell by
(x,y), each character of
S corresponds to an instruction as follows:
'L' means to go left, i.e. to the cell
(x−1,y)
'R' means to go right, i.e. to the cell
(x+1,y)
'U' means to go up, i.e. to the cell
(x,y+1)
'D' means to go down, i.e. to the cell
(x,y−1)
In addition, Chef should never perform multiple consecutive moves along the same axis of the grid. If there are multiple consecutive instructions to move along the same axis (left/right or up/down), he should perform only the first of these moves.
Find the cell
(x
g
,y
g
) which contains the hidden gift.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains a single string
S with length
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers
x
g
and
y
g
.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1,000
S contains only characters 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D'

Explanation:
Example case 1: Chef's path is
(0,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,0)→(−1,1)→(0,1).
