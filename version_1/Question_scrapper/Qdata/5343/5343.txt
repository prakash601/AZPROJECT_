Chef has a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. For a positive integer
M, sequence
B is defined as
B=A∗M that is, appending
A exactly
M times. For example, If
A=[1,2] and
M=3, then
B=A∗M=[1,2,1,2,1,2]
You have to help him to find out the minimum value of
M such that the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence is maximum possible.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
###Output: For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum value of
M.
###Constraints

Explanation:
In the first test case, Choosing
M=2 gives
B=[2,1,2,1] which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length
2 which is the maximum possible.
In the second test case, Choosing
M=1 gives
B=[1,2] which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length
2 which is the maximum possible.
