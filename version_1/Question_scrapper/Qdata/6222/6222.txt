While doing his research in the Institute of Lovely Graphs, Rashad came up with another problem called Prime Graph.
Prime Graph is a simple graph (undirected graph which does not contain any self-loops or multiple-edges) with
N nodes such that the degree of each node is prime. Rashad wants to know what is the maximum number of edges a prime graph with
N nodes can contain. Can you help Rashad answer this question?
Note: The degree of a node in a simple graph is the number of edges that are incident on the node and a prime number is a natural number greater than
1 which has exactly two divisors -
1 and the number itself.
Input Format
The first line contains
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the number of nodes in the graph.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of edges a prime graph of
N nodes can contain.

Explanation:
For
N=3 and
4 we can construct a complete graph (a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge).
For
N=5 we can construct a prime graph with at most
7 edges. One such graph is:
