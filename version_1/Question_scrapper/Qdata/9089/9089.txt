You are given
n
distinct points
p1,p2,…,pn
on the plane and a positive integer
R
.
Find the number of pairs of indices
(i,j)
such that
1≤i<j≤n
, and for every possible
k
(
1≤k≤n
) the distance from the point
pk
to the segment between points
pi
and
pj
is at most
R
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
R
(
1≤n≤3000
,
1≤R≤105
) — the number of points and the maximum distance between a point and a segment.
Each of the next
n
lines contains two integers
xi
,
yi
(
−105≤xi,yi≤105
) that define the
i
-th point
pi=(xi,yi)
. All points are distinct.
It is guaranteed that the answer does not change if the parameter
R
is changed by at most
10−2
.
Output
Print the number of suitable pairs
(i,j)
.

Note
In the first example, the only pair of points
(−3,0)
,
(3,0)
is suitable. The distance to the segment between these points from the points
(0,1)
and
(0,−1)
is equal to
1
, which is less than
R=2
.
In the second example, all possible pairs of points are eligible.
