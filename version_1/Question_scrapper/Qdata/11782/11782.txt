You are given a rooted tree on
n
vertices, its root is the vertex number
1
. The
i
-th vertex contains a number
wi
. Split it into the minimum possible number of vertical paths in such a way that each path contains no more than
L
vertices and the sum of integers
wi
on each path does not exceed
S
. Each vertex should belong to exactly one path.
A vertical path is a sequence of vertices
v1,v2,…,vk
where
vi
(
i≥2
) is the parent of
vi−1
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
L
,
S
(
1≤n≤105
,
1≤L≤105
,
1≤S≤1018
) — the number of vertices, the maximum number of vertices in one path and the maximum sum in one path.
The second line contains
n
integers
w1,w2,…,wn
(
1≤wi≤109
) — the numbers in the vertices of the tree.
The third line contains
n−1
integers
p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi<i
), where
pi
is the parent of the
i
-th vertex in the tree.
Output
Output one number  — the minimum number of vertical paths. If it is impossible to split the tree, output
−1
.

Note
In the first sample the tree is split into
{1}, {2}, {3}
.
In the second sample the tree is split into
{1, 2}, {3}
or
{1, 3}, {2}
.
In the third sample it is impossible to split the tree.
