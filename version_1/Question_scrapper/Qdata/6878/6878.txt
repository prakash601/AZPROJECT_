Given is a tree with
N weighted vertices and
N−1 weighted edges. The
i-th vertex has a weight of
A
i
. The
i-th edge has a weight of
W
i
and connects vertices
u
i
and
v
i
.
Let
dist(x,y) be the sum of weights of the edges in the unique simple path connecting vertices
x and
y.
Let
V(x,y) be the set of vertices appearing in the unique simple path connecting vertices
x and
y (including
x and
y).
You are asked
Q queries. In the
i-th query, you are given two integers
x
i
and
y
i
and you need to compute:
k∈V(x
i
,y
i
)
∑
(dist(x
i
,k)−dist(k,y
i
))⋅A
k
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line contains two integers
N and
Q.

Explanation:
Test Case
1:
For the first query,
V(4,5)={4,2,1,5}. The answer is
1⋅(0−5)+3⋅(1−4)+5⋅(3−2)+2⋅(5−0)=1
For the second query,
V(5,4)={5,1,2,4}. The answer is
2⋅(0−5)+5⋅(2−3)+3⋅(4−1)+1⋅(5−0)=−1
