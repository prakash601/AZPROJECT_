Consider an undirected graph
G with
N vertices, numbered
1 through
N. You are given an integer sequence

u and
v, there is an edge between those vertices if and only if
A
u
and
A
v
are coprime. Find the number of connected components of
G.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
