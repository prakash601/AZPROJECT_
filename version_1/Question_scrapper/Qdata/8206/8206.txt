Note that the memory limit is unusual.
Let's define the sequence of Fibonacci strings as follows:
f0
is 0,
f1
is 1,
fi
is
fi−1+fi−2
for
i>1
(
+
denotes the concatenation of two strings). So, for example,
f2
is 10,
f3
is 101,
f4
is 10110.
For a given string
s
, let's define
g(s)
as the number of ways to cut it into several (any number, possibly even just one) strings such that none of these strings are Fibonacci strings. For example, if
s
is 10110101,
g(s)=3
since there are three ways to cut it:
101101
+
01;
1011
+
0101;
1011
+
01
+
01.
You are given a sequence of strings
s1,s2,…,sn
. Calculate
g(s1),g(s1+s2),…,g(s1+s2+…+sn)
. Since these values can be huge, print them modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅103
).
Then,
n
lines follow. The
i
-th line contains the string
si
(
1≤|si|≤103
), consisting of characters 0 and/or 1.
Output
Print
n
integers, where the
i
-th integer is
g(s1+s2+…+si)mod998244353
.
