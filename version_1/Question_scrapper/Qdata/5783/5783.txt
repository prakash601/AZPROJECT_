Given a positive integer
N, find two positive integers
A and
B, such that
A−B=N and the number of distinct prime factors of
A and
B are equal. If there exist multiple pairs of values of
A and
B satisfying the given conditions, you can output any one of them.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, integer
N.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line two space separated integers
A and
B. If there are multiple answers, you can output any one of them.
