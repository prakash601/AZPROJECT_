Given a string S consisting of only opening and closing curly brackets '{' and '}', find out the minimum number of reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression.
A reversal means changing '{' to '}' or vice-versa.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "}{{}}{{{"
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to balance is:
"{{{}}{}}". There is no balanced sequence
that can be formed in lesser reversals.
Example 2:
Input: 
S = "{{}{{{}{{}}{{"
Output: -1
: There's no way we can balance
this sequence of braces.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countRev() which takes the string S as the input parameter and returns the minimum number of reversals required to balance the bracket sequence. If balancing is not possible, return -1. 
Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
