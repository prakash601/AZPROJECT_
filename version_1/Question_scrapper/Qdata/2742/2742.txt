Given a special binary tree having random pointers along with the usual left and right pointers. Clone the given tree.

Example 1:
Input:

Output: 1
Explanation: The tree was cloned successfully.

Your Task:
No need to read input or print anything. Complete the function cloneTree() which takes root of the given tree as input parameter and returns the root of the cloned tree. 
Note: The output is 1 if the tree is cloned successfully. Otherwise output is 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 100
1 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 1000
