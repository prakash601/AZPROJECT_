Shubman Gill is playing an international match.
He played a total of
N balls, where, in the
i
th
ball, he scored
A
i
runs.
The strike rate of a player is calculated as :
no. of balls played
no. of runs
×100.
Preet, a math enthusiast, is currently watching the match. Help him find the number of times, Shubman's strike rate became exactly
100.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the total number of balls played by Gill.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers where
A
i
denotes runs scored on
i
th
ball.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the total number of times the strike rate of Gill became
100.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Shubhman's strike rate would be:
After
1 ball:
1
1
×100=100.
After
2 balls:
2
1
×100=50.
After
3 balls:
3
3
×100=100.
After
4 balls:
4
6
×100=150.
Thus, the strike rate was exactly
100 twice.
Test case
2: Shubhman's strike rate would be:
After
1 ball:
1
2
×100=200.
After
2 balls:
2
8
×100=400.
After
3 balls:
3
8
×100=266.66.
After
4 balls:
4
9
×100=225.
After
5 balls:
5
9
×100=180.
Thus the strike rate was never exactly
100.
