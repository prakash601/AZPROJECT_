You are given a string
S with length
N and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two adjacent elements of
S (two characters) and swap them; however, neither of these elements may be used in any other operation.
Find the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string
S into a palindrome, or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains a single string
S with length
N.
Output
For each test case:
If it is impossible to make the string
S a palindrome, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single integer ― the minimum required number of operations.
