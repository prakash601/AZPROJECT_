When Chef was cooking donuts, thunder suddenly came across the gray-blue sky. That's how Lemon came to Earth, and that's also why she loves DONUTS! Since Lemon is a clever person, she often thinks about some problem before having donuts. This time, she thought about the following problem:
There are
N donuts. Each donut is a torus described by parameters
x,
y,
z,
R,
r, where the center of the torus has Cartesian coordinates
(x,y,z),
R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of its tube and
r is the radius of the tube. The rotational axis of each torus is parallel with the
z-axis.
The tori may touch or intersect each other. What is the total volume they take up, i.e. the volume of the union of all
tori?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
Each of the following
N lines contains five space-separated real numbers
x,
y,
z,
R and
r describing one torus.
Output
Print a single line containing one real number — the total volume of the
N tori. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed
10
−2
.
