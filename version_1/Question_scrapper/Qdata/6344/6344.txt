This is an interactive task.
Note that, we are using
0− based indexing.
Chef has a hidden array
A of length
K. He also has a special integer function
F which is defined over non-negative integers as follows:
If
(0≤i<K),
F(i)=A
i
;
If
(i≥K),
F(i)=−∑
j=1
K
F(i−j).
You are given an array
B consisting of
N non-negative integers. Calculate the value of
F(B
i
), for all
(0≤i<N).
To calculate the answer, you can ask some queries. Each query is of the form:
?
X : You give an integer
X
(0≤X≤10
18
) to the judge. The judge will return the value of
F(X).
Since the judge is quite old and might break down soon, be as fast as possible.
Formally, let
D be the minimum number of queries needed to find all the values
F(B
i
)
(0≤i<N) for given array
B and any array
A of size
K. Your program will be accepted if you find all the values in at most
D queries.
Note: The judge is not adaptive. The array
A is fixed before any queries are made.
Interaction
Begin the interaction by reading a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for
T test cases follows.
For each test case, first read a single integer
K, denoting the size of array
A.
Now, read an integer
N, denoting the size of array
B.
Now, read
N space-separated integers, representing the array
B.
Now, you may begin asking queries. To ask a query about the value of
F(X)
(0≤X≤10
18
), output:
?
X
You will then receive an integer
Y - denoting the value of
F(X).
When you have found all the required values, print the answer in the following format:
! F(B
0
) F(B
1
)… F(B
N−1
)
Outputting the answer does not count towards the limit of
D queries.
Do not output extra space or newline, as it may cause Wrong Answer verdict.
If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
If you receive a Judge Error verdict, it means your program actually has one of many possible errors: an Idleness Limit Exceeded error (it is waiting for input that does not exist), a Runtime error, you asked an invalid query, or possibly some other error.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Test case
1:
A=[3,4,3]. So,
F(3)=−10.
Note: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.
