Your task is simple.


You need to find the value of
.


As the value could be too large, output it modulo M.
Input
The first contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.
Then there are T lines, each describing a single test case and contains two space separated integers N and M respectively.
Output
For each test case, output the value of summation modulo M on a separate line.
Constraints
1 ≤ M ≤ 100000
There are two types of datasets:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106 , 1 ≤ T ≤ 3000
106 ≤ N ≤ 1010 , 1 ≤ T ≤ 30
Sample 1:
Input
Output
1
4 1000
373
Explanation:
14*4 + 24*2 + 34*1 + 44*1 = 373
