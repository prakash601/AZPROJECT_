Chef has an array
A of length
N.
He can modify this array by applying a special operation any number of times. In one operation, he can:
Select two indices
i and
j
(1≤i<j≤∣A∣).
Append
A
i
⊕A
j
to the end of the array, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation
Remove
A
i
and
A
j
from the array.
Chef wants to maximize the product of all the elements of the array after applying these operations.
Help Chef determine the maximum product he can achieve by applying this operation any (possibly zero) number of times. As this number can be large, print it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N — the number of elements in the array.
The second line consists of
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the elements of the array initially.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum product he can achieve modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can make the following operations:
Operation
1: Choose
i=1 and
j=2, append
A
1
⊕A
2
=1⊕2=3 to the end of the array and remove elements
A
1
and
A
2
. Thus, the array becomes
[1,2,3].
Operation
2: Choose
i=1 and
j=2, append
A
1
⊕A
2
=1⊕2=3 to the end of the array and remove elements
A
1
and
A
2
. Thus, the array becomes
[3,3].
The product of all elements of the array is
3×3=9. It can be shown that this is the maximum product that can be obtained by applying any number of operations on the array.
Test case
2: The product of all elements of the array is
3×3=9. It can be shown that this is the maximum product that can be obtained by applying any number of operations on the array.
Thus, Chef does not need to perform any operations.
Test case
3: Chef can make the following operation:
Operation
1: Choose
i=1 and
j=2, append
A
1
⊕A
2
=1⊕2=3 to the end of the array and remove elements
A
1
and
A
2
. Thus, the array becomes
[3].
The product of all elements is
3. It can be shown that this is the maximum product that can be obtained by applying any number of operations on the array.
