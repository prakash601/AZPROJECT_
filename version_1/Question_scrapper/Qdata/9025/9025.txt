A sequence of integers
b1,b2,…,bm
is called good if
max(b1,b2,…,bm)⋅min(b1,b2,…,bm)≥b1+b2+…+bm
.
A sequence of integers
a1,a2,…,an
is called perfect if every non-empty subsequence of
a
is good.
YouKn0wWho has two integers
n
and
M
,
M
is prime. Help him find the number, modulo
M
, of perfect sequences
a1,a2,…,an
such that
1≤ai≤n+1
for each integer
i
from
1
to
n
.
A sequence
d
is a subsequence of a sequence
c
if
d
can be obtained from
c
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains two space-separated integers
n
and
M
(
1≤n≤200
;
108≤M≤109
). It is guaranteed that
M
is prime.
Output
Print a single integer  — the number of perfect sequences modulo
M
.

Note
In the first test case, the perfect sequences are
[2,2]
,
[2,3]
,
[3,2]
and
[3,3]
.
In the second test case, some of the perfect sequences are
[3,4,3,5]
,
[4,5,4,4]
,
[4,5,5,5]
etc. One example of a sequence which is not perfect is
[2,3,3,4]
, because, for example, the subsequence
[2,3,4]
is not an good as
2⋅4<2+3+4
.
