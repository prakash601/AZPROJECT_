Appy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are
N problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between
1 and
N inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them ― Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by
A but not divisible by
B, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by
B but not divisible by
A (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both
A and
B).
To win, it is necessary to solve at least
K problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
N,
A,
B and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Win" if they can solve at least
K problems or "Lose" otherwise (without quotes).

Win
Explanation:
Example case 1: Appy is solving the problems with codes
2 and
4, Chef is solving the problem with code
3. Nobody is solving problem
6, since
6 is divisible by both
2 and
3. Therefore, they can solve
3 problems and win.
