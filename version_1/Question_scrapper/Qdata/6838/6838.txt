For positive integers
a and
b, we say that a fraction
b
a
is good if it is equal to
m+1
m
for some positive integer
m.
You are given an integer
N. Find the number of pairs of integers
i,j such that
1≤i,j≤N and the fraction
i+1
i
⋅
j
j+1
is good.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer
N.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of pairs of integers
i,j (
1≤i,j≤N) such that
i+1
i
⋅
j
j+1
is good.

Explanation:
The following eight pairs
(i,j) give good fractions:
(1,2),
(1,3),
(2,3),
(2,4),
(2,5),
(3,4),
(3,5) and
(4,5).
