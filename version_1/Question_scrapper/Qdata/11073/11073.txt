You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
.
In one operation you can choose two elements
ai
and
aj
(
i≠j
) and decrease each of them by one.
You need to check whether it is possible to make all the elements equal to zero or not.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
) — the size of the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of the array.
Output
Print "YES" if it is possible to make all elements zero, otherwise print "NO".

6
1 2 3 4 5 6
output
Copy
NO
Note
In the first example, you can make all elements equal to zero in
3
operations:
Decrease
a1
and
a2
,
Decrease
a3
and
a4
,
Decrease
a3
and
a4
In the second example, one can show that it is impossible to make all elements equal to zero.
