You are given arrays
A and
B of length
N each. Determine the number of good pairs.
A pair
(i,j)
(1≤i,j≤N) is said to be good if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
i<j;
A
i
=B
j
;
A

Input Format
First line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Description of each test case:
First line contains an integer
N - denoting the length of the arrays.
Second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The only good pair
(i,j) is
(1,3). Here,
1<3
A
1
=1 and
B
3
=1. Thus,
A
1
=B
3
.
A
3
=3 and
B
1
=3. Thus,
A
3
=B
1
.
Test Case
2: There are no good pairs.
Test Case
3: There are
3 good pairs
(i,j). These are
(1,2),(1,3), and
(2,3).
Test Case
4: There are
2 good pairs
(i,j). These are
(1,2) and
(3,4).
