It is known that in regular dice, the sum of opposite faces is
7.
A regular dice is rolled and you are given the value
X showing on the top face. Determine the value on the bottom face.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only of each test case contains a single integer
X - the value on the top face.
Output Format
For each test case, output the value on the bottom face.
Constraints
1≤T≤6
1≤X≤6

Explanation:
Test case-1: The value on the top face is
3. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is
4 because
3+4=7.
Test case-2: The value on the top face is
1. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is
6 because
1+6=7.
Test case-3: The value on the top face is
6. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is
1 because
6+1=7.
