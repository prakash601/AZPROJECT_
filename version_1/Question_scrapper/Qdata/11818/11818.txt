Vasya has a multiset
s
consisting of
n
integer numbers. Vasya calls some number
x
nice if it appears in the multiset exactly once. For example, multiset
{1,1,2,3,3,3,4}
contains nice numbers
2
and
4
.
Vasya wants to split multiset
s
into two multisets
a
and
b
(one of which may be empty) in such a way that the quantity of nice numbers in multiset
a
would be the same as the quantity of nice numbers in multiset
b
(the quantity of numbers to appear exactly once in multiset
a
and the quantity of numbers to appear exactly once in multiset
b
).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n (2≤n≤100)
.
The second line contains
n
integers
s1,s2,…sn (1≤si≤100)
— the multiset
s
.
Output
If there exists no split of
s
to satisfy the given requirements, then print "NO" in the first line.
Otherwise print "YES" in the first line.
The second line should contain a string, consisting of
n
characters.
i
-th character should be equal to 'A' if the
i
-th element of multiset
s
goes to multiset
a
and 'B' if if the
i
-th element of multiset
s
goes to multiset
b
. Elements are numbered from
1
to
n
in the order they are given in the input.
If there exist multiple solutions, then print any of them.
