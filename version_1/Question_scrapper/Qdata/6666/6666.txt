There is a full-scale war taking place in Treeland. Chef needs to travel between cities in Treeland to work, but during the war, it is not safe.
In Treeland, there are
N cities (numbered
1 through
N) and
N−1 bidirectional roads connecting them in such a way that Chef can reach each city from any other city using these roads. Each road is occupied by a unique faction that assigned a positive integer code to it.
Let
f(A,B) denote the greatest positive integer which divides the code of each road on the shortest path between cities
A and
B (the GCD of these codes). If Chef wants to go from city
A to city
B safely, he needs to pay
f(A,B) units of money.
Since Chef is not sure between which pairs of cities he is going to travel, he wants to know
S=
i=1
∑
N
j=i+1
∑
N
f(i,j).
Help Chef calculate
S.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers
X,
Y and
Z denoting that cities
X and
Y are connected by a road with code
Z.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
S.
