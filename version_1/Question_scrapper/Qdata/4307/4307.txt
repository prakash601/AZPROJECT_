JJ gives you a number
N and challenges you to construct a permutation
P of length
N such that:
∣P
i+1
−P
i
∣≥2 for all
1≤i≤N−1 (Here
∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of
x)
Can you complete JJ's challenge?
As a reminder, a permutation of length
N is an array where every integer from
1 to
N occurs exactly once.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer
— the length of the permutation
P to be constructed.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
denoting the permutation
P which satisfies the given conditions.
If no such permutation exists, output
−1.
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: It can be proven that no permutation of length
2 exists that satisfies the given conditions.
Test Case 2:
[1,4,2,5,3,6] satisfies the given condition, since
∣P
i+1
−P
i
∣≥2 for all
1≤i≤N−1
