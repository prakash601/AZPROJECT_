Explanation:
TestCase
1: Number of coconuts of Type
A required =
100
1000
=10 and number of coconuts of Type
B required =
400
1200
=3. So the total number of coconuts required is
10+3=13.
TestCase
2: Number of coconuts of Type
A required =
100
1000
=10 and number of coconuts of Type
B required =
450
1350
=3. So the total number of coconuts required is
10+3=13.
TestCase
3: Number of coconuts of Type
A required =
150
1200
=8 and number of coconuts of Type
B required =
400
1200
=3. So the total number of coconuts required is
8+3=11.
