You are given an unweighted directed graph with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N). You are also given
2M ranges
[A

] and
[C

M
] describing the edges of the graph in the following way: For each
i (
1≤i≤M) and for each pair of vertices
u∈[A
i
,B
i
],
v∈[C
i
,D
i
], there is an edge from
u to
v.
Finally, you are given two vertices
X and
Y. Find the shortest distance from
X to
Y or determine that there is no path from
X to
Y.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
N,
M,
X and
Y.
M lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains four space-separated integers
A
i
,
B
i
,
C
i
and
D
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the shortest distance from vertex
X to vertex
Y, or
−1 if there is no path from
X to
Y.
