It turns out that this is exactly the
100
-th problem of mine that appears in some programming competition. So it has to be special! And what can be more special than another problem about LIS...
You are given a permutation
p1,p2,…,p2n+1
of integers from
1
to
2n+1
. You will have to process
q
updates, where the
i
-th update consists in swapping
pui,pvi
.
After each update, find any cyclic shift of
p
with
LIS≤n
, or determine that there is no such shift. (Refer to the output section for details).
Here
LIS(a)
denotes the length of longest strictly increasing subsequence of
a
.
Hacks are disabled in this problem. Don't ask why.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n,q
(
2≤n≤105
,
1≤q≤105
).
The second line of the input contains
2n+1
integers
p1,p2,…,p2n+1
(
1≤pi≤2n+1
, all
pi
are distinct)  — the elements of
p
.
The
i
-th of the next
q
lines contains two integers
ui,vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤2n+1
,
ui≠vi
)  — indicating that you have to swap elements
pui,pvi
in the
i
-th update.
Output
After each update, output any
k
(0≤k≤2n)
, such that the length of the longest increasing subsequence of
(pk+1,pk+2,…,p2n+1,p1,…,pk)
doesn't exceed
n
, or
−1
, if there is no such
k
.

Note
After the first update, our permutation becomes
(5,2,3,4,1)
. We can show that all its cyclic shifts have
LIS≥3
.
After the second update, our permutation becomes
(1,2,3,4,5)
. We can show that all its cyclic shifts have
LIS≥3
.
After the third update, our permutation becomes
(1,2,3,5,4)
. Its shift by
2
is
(3,5,4,1,2)
, and its
LIS=2
.
After the fourth update, our permutation becomes
(1,2,3,4,5)
. We can show that all its cyclic shifts have
LIS≥3
.
After the fifth update, our permutation becomes
(4,2,3,1,5)
. Its shift by
4
is
(5,4,2,3,1)
, and its
LIS=2
.
After the fifth update, our permutation becomes
(4,5,3,1,2)
. Its shift by
0
is
(4,5,3,1,2)
, and its
LIS=2
.
