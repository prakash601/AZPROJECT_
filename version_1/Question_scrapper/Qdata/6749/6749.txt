Explanation:
Test Case
1:
k=1: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is
{1}.
The sum of all elements of this subsequence is
1.
Since there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.
k=2: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is
{2}.
The sum of all elements of this subsequence is
2.
Since there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.
k=3: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are
{3} and
{2,1}. For the subsequence
{2,1}:
The sum of all elements of this subsequence is
2+1=3.
There are
2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are
1 and
5 respectively. Here,
f(1,5)=max
i=1
5
A
i
=5 and
max(2,1)=2. Thus,
f(1,5)>max(A
1
,A
5
).
k=4: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are
{4} and
{3,1}. For the subsequence
{3,1}:
The sum of all elements of this subsequence is
3+1=4.
There are
2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are
3 and
5 respectively. Here,
f(3,5)=max
i=3
5
A
i
=5 and
max(3,1)=3. Thus,
f(3,5)>max(A
3
,A
5
).
k=5: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are
{3},
{4,1} and
{2,3}. For the subsequence
{2,3}:
The sum of all elements of this subsequence is
2+3=5.
There are
2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are
1 and
3 respectively. Here,
f(1,3)=max
i=1
3
A
i
=4 and
max(2,3)=3. Thus,
f(1,3)>max(A
1
,A
3
).
k=6: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is
{2,3,1}.
The sum of all elements of this subsequence is
2+3+1=6.
There are
3 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are
1,3 and
5 respectively. Here,
f(1,3)=max
i=1
3
A
i
=4 and
max(2,3)=3. Thus,

=5 and
max(3,1)=3. Thus,
