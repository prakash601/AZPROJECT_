You are given a complete directed graph
Kn
with
n
vertices: each pair of vertices
u≠v
in
Kn
have both directed edges
(u,v)
and
(v,u)
; there are no self-loops.
You should find such a cycle in
Kn
that visits every directed edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices).
We can write such cycle as a list of
n(n−1)+1
vertices
v1,v2,v3,…,vn(n−1)−1,vn(n−1),vn(n−1)+1=v1
— a visiting order, where each
(vi,vi+1)
occurs exactly once.
Find the lexicographically smallest such cycle. It's not hard to prove that the cycle always exists.
Since the answer can be too large print its
[l,r]
segment, in other words,
vl,vl+1,…,vr
.
Input
The first line contains the single integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of test cases.
Next
T
lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
l
and
r
(
2≤n≤105
,
1≤l≤r≤n(n−1)+1
,
r−l+1≤105
) — the number of vertices in
Kn
, and segment of the cycle to print.
It's guaranteed that the total sum of
n
doesn't exceed
105
and the total sum of
r−l+1
doesn't exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case print the segment
vl,vl+1,…,vr
of the lexicographically smallest cycle that visits every edge exactly once.

Note
In the second test case, the lexicographically minimum cycle looks like:
1,2,1,3,2,3,1
.
In the third test case, it's quite obvious that the cycle should start and end in vertex
1
.
