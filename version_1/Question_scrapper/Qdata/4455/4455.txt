You are given an integer
N. Construct a permutation
A of length
N which is attractive.
A permutation is called attractive if the bitwise XOR of all absolute differences of adjacent pairs of elements is equal to
0.
Formally, a permutation
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] of length
N is said to be attractive if:
∣A
1
−A
2
∣⊕∣A
2
−A
3
∣⊕…⊕∣A
N−1
−A
N
∣=0
where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Output any attractive permutation of length
N. If no attractive permutation exists, print
−1 instead.
Note: A permutation of length
N is an array
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] such that every integer from
1 to
N occurs exactly once in
A. For example,
[1,2,3] and
[2,3,1] are permutations of length
3, but
[1,2,1],
[4,1,2], and
[2,3,1,4] are not.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line an attractive permutation of
N integers, or
−1 if no attractive permutation exists.

Test Case
1:
∣3−2∣⊕∣2−1∣=1⊕1=0
Note that there are other correct answers — for example,
[1,2,3] would also be accepted as correct.
