You are given two arrays
a
and
b
each consisting of
n
integers. All elements of
a
are pairwise distinct.
Find the number of ways to reorder
a
such that
ai>bi
for all
1≤i≤n
, modulo
109+7
.
Two ways of reordering are considered different if the resulting arrays are different.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array
a
and
b
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
distinct integers
a1
,
a2
,
…
,
an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the array
a
. It is guaranteed that all elements of
a
are pairwise distinct.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1
,
b2
,
…
,
bn
(
1≤bi≤109
) — the array
b
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output the number of ways to reorder array
a
such that
ai>bi
for all
1≤i≤n
, modulo
109+7
.
