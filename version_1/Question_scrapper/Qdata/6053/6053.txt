Chef works in a similar way to a travelling salesman ― he always travels to new cities in order to sell his delicious dishes.
Today, Chef is planning to visit
N cities (numbered
1 through
N). There is a direct way to travel between each pair of cities. Each city has a specific temperature; let's denote the temperature in the
i-th city by
C
i
. Chef has a fixed temperature tolerance
D with the following meaning: for each pair of cities
a and
b, he may travel from city
a directly to city
b only if
∣C
a
−C
b
∣≤D, otherwise he would catch a heavy flu because of the sudden change in temperature.
Chef starts from city
. Is he able to visit all
cities in such a way that each city is visited exactly once?
Notes:
Chef is not able to travel through a city without visiting it.
City
1 is visited at the beginning.
It is not necessary to be able to travel directly to city
1 from the last city Chef visits.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
D.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
C

N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if Chef can visit all cities or "NO" (without quotes) if he cannot.
