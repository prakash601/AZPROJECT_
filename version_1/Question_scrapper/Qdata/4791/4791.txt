Chef has
4 positive integers
A,
B,
C, and
D such that
A
%
B=C
%
D.
Find the smallest positive integer
X such that
(A+X)
%
B=(C+X)
%
D holds.
It is guaranteed that such
X always exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
A,
B,
C, and
D.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer —
X, the smallest integer satisfying the conditions.
