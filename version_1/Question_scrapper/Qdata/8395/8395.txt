 — What is my mission?
 — To count graph diameters.
You and Your Submission
A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A weighted tree has a weight assigned to each edge. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to this vertex.
You are given a weighted tree with
n
vertices, each edge has a weight of
1
. Let
L
be the set of vertices with degree equal to
1
.
You have to answer
q
independent queries. In the
i
-th query:
You are given a positive integer
xi
.
For all
u,v∈L
such that
u<v
, add edge
(u,v)
with weight
xi
to the graph (initially the given tree).
Find the diameter of the resulting graph.
The diameter of a graph is equal to
max
1≤u<v≤n
d(u,v)
, where
d(u,v)
is the length of the shortest path between vertex
u
and vertex
v
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤106
).
The second line contains
n−1
integers
p2,p3,…,pn
(
1≤pi<i
) indicating that there is an edge between vertices
i
and
pi
. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
The third line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤10
).
The fourth line contains
q
integers
x1,x2,…,xq
(
1≤xi≤n
). All
xi
are distinct.
Output
Print
q
integers in a single line — the answers to the queries.
