Given a positive integer N, find the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and N(inclusive).
  Example 1:
Input: N = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: 2, 3, and 5 are prime
numbers between 1 and 5(inclusive).
Example 2:
Input: N = 10
Output: 17
Explanation: 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime
numbers between 1 and 10(inclusive).
  Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function prime_Sum() which takes N as input parameter and returns the sum of all primes between 1 and N(inclusive).
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N*log(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000000
