You are given a tree with
N nodes rooted at node
1.
The
i
th
node of the tree has a value
A
i
assigned to it.
For the
i
th
node
(1≤i≤N), output the minimum value of bitwise XOR of the values of any two distinct nodes in the subtree of node
i.
Formally, for each node
i, find the value of
min(A
x
⊕A
y
), where
x

=y and
x,y∈ subtree of node
i.
Note that since leaf nodes have only
1 node in their subtree, output
−1 for all the leaf nodes.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a single line of input, an integer
- the number of nodes in the tree.
The following
(N−1) lines each contain two integers,
U and
V, denoting an undirected edge between nodes
U and
V.
The last line of each test case contains
N integers. The
i
th
integer is the value assigned to
i
th
node.
It is assured that the edges given in the input form a tree.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N integers where the
i
th
integer is the minimum value of bitwise XOR of the values of any two distinct nodes in the subtree of node
i.
If node
i is a leaf node, output
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one node in the tree which is a leaf node. Hence, the output is
−1.
Test case
2: The tree formed by the input of second test case is shown below:
Nodes
2 and Node
3 are leaf nodes. Hence, the answer for them is
−1.
For the subtree formed by node
1, the answer is
min((4⊕5),(5⊕6),(4⊕6)) which is
min(1,3,2)=1.
