You are given an array
A=A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
of size
N.
Consider a subsequence
S=S
1
,S
2
,…,S
M
of
A. Let us define the Goodness of subsequence
S as follows:
Sort the subsequence
S in non-decreasing order.
Then, the Goodness of subsequence
S is the number of indices such that
S
i
=i, where
(1≤i≤∣S∣).
For example, suppose
A=[10,3,2,5,11,3,1,12], and the subsequence is
S=[3,2,5,3,1]. After sorting,
S=[1,2,3,3,5], and so the Goodness of
S is
4.
Consider all the
2
N
−1 possible non-empty subsequences of array
A, and find the sum of all their .
Since the answer can be large, output the answer modulo
10
9
+7.
Note: A sequence
S is a subsequence of array
A if
S can be obtained from
A by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example,
[3,1] is a subsequence of
[3,2,1] and
[4,3,1], but not a subsequence of
[1,3,3,7] and
[3,10,4].
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers,

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer modulo
10

+7.

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The given array is
[1,2]. There are 3 possible non-empty subsequences:
[1]. The Goodness of this subsequence is
1, since
S
1
=1.
[2]. The Goodness of this subsequence is
0.
[1,2]. The Goodness of this subsequence is
2, since
S
1
=1 and
S
2
=2.
Thus the total sum is
1+0+2=3, which is the answer.
