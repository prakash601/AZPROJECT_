Let's call a list of positive integers
a0,a1,...,an−1
a power sequence if there is a positive integer
c
, so that for every
0≤i≤n−1
then
ai=ci
.
Given a list of
n
positive integers
a0,a1,...,an−1
, you are allowed to:
Reorder the list (i.e. pick a permutation
p
of
{0,1,...,n−1}
and change
ai
to
api
), then
Do the following operation any number of times: pick an index
i
and change
ai
to
ai−1
or
ai+1
(i.e. increment or decrement
ai
by
1
) with a cost of
1
.
Find the minimum cost to transform
a0,a1,...,an−1
into a power sequence.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a0,a1,...,an−1
(
1≤ai≤109
).
Output
Print the minimum cost to transform
a0,a1,...,an−1
into a power sequence.

Note
In the first example, we first reorder
{1,3,2}
into
{1,2,3}
, then increment
a2
to
4
with cost
1
to get a power sequence
{1,2,4}
.
