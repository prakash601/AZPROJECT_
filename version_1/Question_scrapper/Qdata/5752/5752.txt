There is a castle which can be described as an undirected tree with
N vertices and
N−1 edges. Each edge has a magic number
C.
When a group of tourists visit the castle, they are interested in a path between vertices
U and
V. They think that an edge is interesting if its magic number is
≤K. The total attractiveness of the path is the xor of all interesting edges on it.
Given
M groups of tourists, find the total attractiveness of the path for each group.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case descriptions follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the number of vertices.
The next
N−1 lines each contain three integers
U,
V and
C, which denote an edge between vertices
U and
V with magical number
C.
The next line contains a single integer
M, which denotes the number of requests.
The next
M lines contain information about the requests. Each line contains three integers
U,
V and
K.
Output
For each request output a single integer in a separate line - the total attractiveness of the path.
