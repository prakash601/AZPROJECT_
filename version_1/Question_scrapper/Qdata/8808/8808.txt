You have an array
a1,a2,…,an
. Each element initially has value
0
and color
1
. You are also given
q
queries to perform:
Color
l
r
c
: Change the color of elements
al,al+1,⋯,ar
to
c
(
1≤l≤r≤n
,
1≤c≤n
).
Add
c
x
: Add
x
to values of all elements
ai
(
1≤i≤n
) of color
c
(
1≤c≤n
,
−109≤x≤109
).
Query
i
: Print
ai
(
1≤i≤n
).
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤106
) — the length of array
a
and the number of queries you have to perform.
Each of the next
q
lines contains the query given in the form described in the problem statement.
Output
Print the answers to the queries of the third type on separate lines.
