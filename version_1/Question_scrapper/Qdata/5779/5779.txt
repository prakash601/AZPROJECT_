Chef gives you a sequence
A of length
N.
Let
X denote the
MEX of the sequence
A. Chef is interested in the count of positive values
k, such that, if every element
A
i
of
A is replaced by
max(A
i
−k,0), the
MEX of the sequence still remains
X.
Find the count of such values. If there are infinite such values, print
−1 instead.
As a friendly reminder, the
MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence. For instance:
The
MEX of
[2,2,1] is
0 because
0 does not belong to the sequence.
The
MEX of
[3,1,0,1] is
2 because
0 and
1 belong to the sequence, but
2 does not.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N - the length of the sequence
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case print a single integer — the count of positive values
k satisfying the given condition. If there are infinite such values, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There doesn't exist any value of
k satisfying the given condition.
Test case
2: There are infinite values of
k satisfying the given condition.
Test case
3: There is only
1 value of
k satisfying the given condition:
k=4. The
MEX of the given sequence is
3. When every element
A
i
of the given sequence is replaced by
max(A
i
−4,0), the sequence becomes
[1,6,0,0,0,2,0], which also has
MEX=3.
