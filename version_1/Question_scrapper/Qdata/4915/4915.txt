Given an array
A of size
N. Find the maximum value of the expression
a∗b+a−b where
a and
b are
2 distinct elements of the array.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of two lines of input.
First line will contain
N, number of elements of the array.
Second line contains
N space separated integers, elements of the array
A.
###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Explanation:
Case 1: Only possible pair is
[2,2] for which answer =
2∗2+2−2 =
4.
Case 2: There are six possible pairs.
For pairs
[2,3] and
[3,2], answer =
2∗3+max(2−3,3−2) =
7
For pairs
[3,5] and
[5,3] answer =
5∗3+max(3−5,5−3) =
17 and
For the pairs
[2,5] and
[5,2], answer =
2∗5+max(2−5,5−2) =
13.
So final answer is maximum of
{7,17,13} =
17.
