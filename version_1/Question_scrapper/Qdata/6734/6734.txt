Given
K arrays of length
N where the elements are bounded in the range
[L,R].
The Function value of an array is defined as the sum of all elements present in it.
In one move you can change at most
1 element from all the arrays and the changed value must lie within the range
[L,R].
What is the minimum number of operations required to make the function value of all arrays equal?
###Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
K,
N,
L,
R.
Next
K lines contains an array of length
N.
Output
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed to make the function value of all arrays equal in a new line.
