You are given an array
A of length
N.
You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (possibly
0):
Select an index
i (1≤i<N) and replace
A
i+1
with
gcd(A
i
,A
i+1
).
Is it possible to sort
A in non-decreasing order after performing the above operation some number of times?
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line the answer: YES if it is possible to sort
A, and NO otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings Yes, YES, yes, yEs` will all be treated as identical.
Constraints
1≤T≤10

2≤N≤2⋅10

6
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: The array is already sorted.
Test case
2: Set
A
2
=gcd(A
1
,A
2
)=gcd(1,3)=1. The array is now
[1,1,2], which is sorted.
Test case
3: It can be shown that no sequence of operations will sort the array.
