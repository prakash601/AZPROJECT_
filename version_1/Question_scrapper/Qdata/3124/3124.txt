Given a binary matrix mat of size n * m, find out the maximum size square sub-matrix with all 1s.
Example 1:
Input: n = 2, m = 2
mat = {{1, 1}, 
  {1, 1}}
Output: 2
Explaination: The maximum size of the square
sub-matrix is 2. The matrix itself is the 
maximum sized sub-matrix in this case.
Example 2:
Input: n = 2, m = 2
mat = {{0, 0}, 
  {0, 0}}
Output: 0
Explaination: There is no 1 in the matrix.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxSquare() which takes n, m and mat as input parameters and returns the size of the maximum square sub-matrix of given matrix.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*m)
Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1
