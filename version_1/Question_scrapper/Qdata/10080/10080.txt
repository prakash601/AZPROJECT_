Since Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day.
Boboniu designs a map for his
n
mountains. He uses
n−1
roads to connect all
n
mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.
For the
i
-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as
ti
. He also estimated the height of each mountain as
hi
.
A path is a sequence of mountains
M
such that for each
i
(
1≤i<|M|
), there exists a road between
Mi
and
Mi+1
. Boboniu would regard the path as a challenge if for each
i
(
1≤i<|M|
),
hMi≤hMi+1
.
Boboniu wants to divide all
n−1
roads into several challenges. Note that each road must appear in exactly one challenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges.
Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all the challenges. The tiredness of a challenge
M
is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e.
∑
|M|
i=1
tMi
.
He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
), denoting the number of the mountains.
The second line contains
n
integers
t1,t2,…,tn
(
1≤ti≤106
), denoting the tiredness for Boboniu to do Kungfu on each mountain.
The third line contains
n
integers
h1,h2,…,hn
(
1≤hi≤106
), denoting the height of each mountain.
Each of the following
n−1
lines contains two integers
ui
,
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n,ui≠vi
), denoting the ends of the road. It's guaranteed that all mountains are connected via roads.
Output
Print one integer: the smallest sum of tiredness of all challenges.

Note
For the first example:
In the picture, the lighter a point is, the higher the mountain it represents. One of the best divisions is:
Challenge
1
:
3→1→2
Challenge
2
:
5→2→4
The total tiredness of Boboniu is
(30+40+10)+(20+10+50)=160
. It can be shown that this is the minimum total tiredness.
