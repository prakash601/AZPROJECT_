You are given a sequence of non-negative integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. At most once, you may choose a non-negative integer
X and for each valid
i, change
A
i
to
A
i
⊕X (
⊕ denotes bitwise XOR).
Find the minimum possible value of the sum of all elements of the resulting sequence.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A

,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible sum.

Explanation:
Example case 1: If we choose
X=6, the sequence becomes
(4,5,2,3,0).
Example case 2: We can choose
X=7 to make all elements of the resulting sequence equal to
0.
Example case 3: We can choose
X=1. The sequence becomes
(0,0,2), with sum
2.
