Squirrel Liss lived in a forest peacefully, but unexpected trouble happens. Stones fall from a mountain. Initially Squirrel Liss occupies an interval [0, 1]. Next, n stones will fall and Liss will escape from the stones. The stones are numbered from 1 to n in order.
The stones always fall to the center of Liss's interval. When Liss occupies the interval [k - d, k + d] and a stone falls to k, she will escape to the left or to the right. If she escapes to the left, her new interval will be [k - d, k]. If she escapes to the right, her new interval will be [k, k + d].
You are given a string s of length n. If the i-th character of s is "l" or "r", when the i-th stone falls Liss will escape to the left or to the right, respectively. Find the sequence of stones' numbers from left to right after all the n stones falls.
Input
The input consists of only one line. The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 106). Each character in s will be either "l" or "r".
Output
Output n lines — on the i-th line you should print the i-th stone's number from the left.

Note
In the first example, the positions of stones 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will be , respectively. So you should print the sequence: 3, 5, 4, 2, 1.
