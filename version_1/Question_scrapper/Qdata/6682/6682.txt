Alice, being alone, has thought of punishing you with a string problem.
Alice has a string
S of length
N. From
S, she forms a new string
T in the following way:
Add all distinct subarrays of
S which are palindromes to a set.
Sort the set in lexicographically ascending order.
Initialise
T as empty string and append each palindrome to string
T.
For example: If Alice has
S=abbab, then all the distinct subarrays of
S which are palindromes are
{a,abba,b,bb,bab}. After sorting in lexicographically ascending order, she would get
{a,abba,b,bab,bb}. Now, after appending each palindrome to an empty string
T,
T:=T+a,T=a.
T:=T+abba,T=aabba.
T:=T+b,T=aabbab.
T:=T+bab,T=aabbabbab.
T:=T+bb,T=aabbabbabbb.
So, finally she ended up with the string
T=aabbabbabbb.
Now, Alice will give you the string
S and
Q queries of the form:
L
R : You have to print the substring of string
T starting at index
L (
1-based indexing) and ending at index
R. If no such substring exists, i.e
L,R> length of
T, print
−1 instead.
Note:
A substring is obtained by deletion of several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of the string and several (possibly zero) characters from the end of the string.
A string
A is lexicographically smaller than a string
B if and only if one of the following holds:
A is a prefix of
B, but
A

=B;
Let
i denote the first position where
A and
B differ, then
A
i
<B
i
.
Input Format
First line will contain an integer
N denoting the length of the string.
The next line will contain a string
S.
The third line will contain an integer
Q denoting the number of queries.
Next
Q lines, each will contain two space-separated integers
L and
R.
Output Format
For each query, print the substring
T[L,R] (
1-based indexing) in a new line. If no such substring exists, i.e
L,R> length of
T, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Here
T=aabbabbabbb. The explanation for deriving
T has been given in the problem statement.
Query
1:
T[1,1]=a.
Query
2:
T[2,4]=abb.
Query
6: Here
R=14 which is greater than the length of the string. Thus, the answer is
−1.
