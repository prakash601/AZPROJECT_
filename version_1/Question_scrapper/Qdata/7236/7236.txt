You are given a full binary tree of height
n. Node
1 is the root, and for
i≤2
n−1
−1, node
i is the parent of node
2i and node
2i+1. For each node
i, there is a positive integer
a
i
written on it.
A primeful cycle is a group of
k>2 nodes
x
1
,x
2
,…,x
k
such that:
k is a prime number,
gcd(
a
x
1
,a
x
2
) mod
k= gcd(
a
x
2
,a
x
3
) mod
k=…= gcd(
a
x
k−1
,a
x
k
) mod
k= gcd(
a
x
k
,a
x
1
) mod
k .
Let the height of each node be
1 plus the distance from that node to node
1. Note that by this definition, the height of node
1 is
1. Let the beauty value of a primeful cycle of nodes be the sum of the height of each node.
There are
q queries. In each query, you are given a node
x. Considering all the nodes in the subtree of node
x (including node
x), find the smallest possible beauty value of a primeful cycle of nodes taken from these nodes only. If there is no such group, print
−1 instead.
###Input:
The first line contains two integers,
n and
q.
The second line contains
2
n
−1 integers,
a

n
−1
.
The third line contains
q integers, the
i-th of which is the integer
x for the
i-th query.
###Output: For each test case, print a single line containing the answer to the test case. Print the answer to the test cases on separate lines.
