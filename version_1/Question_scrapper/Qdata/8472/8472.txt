You are given an integer
n
and an array
a1,a2,…,an
.
In one operation, you can choose an index
i
(
1≤i<n
) for which
ai≠ai+1
and delete both
ai
and
ai+1
from the array. After deleting
ai
and
ai+1
, the remaining parts of the array are concatenated.
For example, if
a=[1,4,3,3,6,2]
, then after performing an operation with
i=2
, the resulting array will be
[1,3,6,2]
.
What is the maximum possible length of an array of equal elements obtainable from
a
by performing several (perhaps none) of the aforementioned operations?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — the elements of array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
10000
.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer, the maximum possible length of an array of equal elements obtainable from
a
by performing a sequence of operations.

Note
For the first testcase, an optimal sequence of operations would be:
[1,2,3,2,1,3,3]→[3,2,1,3,3]→[3,3,3]
.
For the second testcase, all elements in the array are already equal.
For the third testcase, the only possible sequence of operations is:
[1,1,1,2,2,2]→[1,1,2,2]→[1,2]→[]
. Note that, according to the statement, the elements deleted at each step must be different.
For the fourth testcase, the optimal sequence of operations is:
[1,1,2,2,3,3,1,1]→[1,1,2,3,1,1]→[1,1,1,1]
.
For the fifth testcase, one possible reachable array of two equal elements is
[4,4]
.
