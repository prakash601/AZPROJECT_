Given a set of integers, find all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given sets.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = {1,2}
Output: {0,1,2,3}
Explanation: Four distinct sums can be
calculated which are 0, 1, 2 and 3.
0 if we do not choose any number.
1 if we choose only 1.
2 if we choose only 2.
3 if we choose 1 and 2.
Example 2:
Input: nums = {1,2,3}
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
Explanation: Seven distinct sum can be calculated
which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
0 if we do not choose any number.
1 if we choose only 1.
2 if we choose only 2.
3 if we choose only 3.
4 if we choose 1 and 3.
5 if we choose 2 and 3.
6 if we choose 1, 2 and 3.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function DistinictSum() which takes nums as input parameter and returns a list containing the distinict sum in increasing order,
  Expected Time Complexity: O(n * sum) where sum = sum of all elements of nums.
Expected Space Complexity: O(n * sum)
  Constraints:
1 <= length of nums <= 102
1 <= nums[i] <= 102
