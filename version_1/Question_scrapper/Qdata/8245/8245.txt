Given an integer sequence
a1,a2,…,an
of length
n
, your task is to compute the number, modulo
998244353
, of ways to partition it into several non-empty continuous subsequences such that the sums of elements in the subsequences form a balanced sequence.
A sequence
s1,s2,…,sk
of length
k
is said to be balanced, if
si=sk−i+1
for every
1≤i≤k
. For example,
[1,2,3,2,1]
and
[1,3,3,1]
are balanced, but
[1,5,15]
is not.
Formally, every partition can be described by a sequence of indexes
i1,i2,…,ik
of length
k
with
1=i1<i2<⋯<ik≤n
such that
k
is the number of non-empty continuous subsequences in the partition;
For every
1≤j≤k
, the
j
-th continuous subsequence starts with
aij
, and ends exactly before
aij+1
, where
ik+1=n+1
. That is, the
j
-th subsequence is
aij,aij+1,…,aij+1−1
.
There are
2n−1
different partitions in total.
Let
s1,s2,…,sk
denote the sums of elements in the subsequences with respect to the partition
i1,i2,…,ik
. Formally, for every
1≤j≤k
,
sj=
ij+1−1
∑
i=ij
ai=aij+aij+1+⋯+aij+1−1.
For example, the partition
[1|2,3|4,5,6]
of sequence
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
is described by the sequence
[1,2,4]
of indexes, and the sums of elements in the subsequences with respect to the partition is
[1,5,15]
.
Two partitions
i1,i2,…,ik
and
i

,…,i

k′
(described by sequences of indexes) are considered to be different, if at least one of the following holds.
k≠k′
,

for some
1≤j≤min{k,k′}
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
), indicating the length of the sequence
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
), indicating the elements of the sequence
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, output the number of partitions with respect to which the sum of elements in each subsequence is balanced, modulo
998244353
.

Note
For the first test case, there is only one way to partition a sequence of length
1
, which is itself and is, of course, balanced.
For the second test case, there are
2
ways to partition it:
The sequence
[1,1]
itself, then
s=[2]
is balanced;
Partition into two subsequences
[1|1]
, then
s=[1,1]
is balanced.
For the third test case, there are
3
ways to partition it:
The sequence
[0,0,1,0]
itself, then
s=[1]
is balanced;
[0|0,1|0]
, then
s=[0,1,0]
is balanced;
[0,0|1|0]
, then
s=[0,1,0]
is balanced.
For the fourth test case, there are
4
ways to partition it:
The sequence
[1,2,3,2,1]
itself, then
s=[9]
is balanced;
[1,2|3|2,1]
, then
s=[3,3,3]
is balanced;
[1|2,3,2|1]
, then
s=[1,7,1]
is balanced;
[1|2|3|2|1]
, then
s=[1,2,3,2,1]
is balanced.
For the fifth test case, there are
2
ways to partition it:
The sequence
[1,3,5,7,9]
itself, then
s=[25]
is balanced;
[1,3,5|7|9]
, then
s=[9,7,9]
is balanced.
For the sixth test case, every possible partition should be counted. So the answer is
232−1≡150994942(mod998244353)
.
