Chef and his friend Magda have
2N mutual friends:
N of these friends are chefs and the other
N are chefettes. The chefs are numbered
1 through
N and the chefettes are (independently) also numbered
1 through
N. Since Magda wants their friends to be as happy as possible and to preserve traditional family values, she wants to pair them up in such a way that each chef is paired with exactly one chefette and each chefette with exactly one chef.
The chefs have heights

N children in total) is maximum possible. Please help her do that.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of

Explanation:
Example case 1: One possible solution is to pair the first chef with the second chefette, the second chef with the first chefette and the third chef with the third chefette. Their children will have heights
3,
3 and
4, respectively.
