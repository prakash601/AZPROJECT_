You are given three non-negative integers
X,
Y and
N. Find the number of integers
Z such that
0≤Z≤N and
(X⊕Z)<(Y⊕Z), where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
X,
Y and
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of integers
Z which satisfy all conditions.
