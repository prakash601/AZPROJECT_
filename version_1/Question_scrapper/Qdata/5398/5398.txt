You are given a permutation
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
N
of the integers
1 through
N. You may perform up to
K operations of the following type:
Choose three pairwise distinct valid indices
i
1
,i
2
,i
3
. Note that these indices do not have to be chosen in increasing order.
Let's denote the values of
p
i
1
,
p
i
2
and
p
i
3
before this operation by
v
1
,
v
2
and
v
3
respectively.
Change
p
i
2
to
v
1
,
p
i
3
to
v
2
and
p
i
1
to
v
3
. In other words, perform a cyclic right shift on the elements
p
i
1
,p
i
2
,p
i
3
in this order.
For example, the permutation
(1,4,3,2,5) can be changed to the permutation
in one operation by choosing
i
1
,
i
2
and
i
3
=5.
Your task is to sort the permutation in increasing order. Note that you do not have to minimise the number of performed operations.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
N
.
Output
For each test case:
If it is impossible to sort the given permutation using at most
K operations, print a single line containing the integer
−1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer
M (
0≤M≤K) ― the number of operations you want to perform.
Then, print
M lines describing these operations. For each
i (
1≤i≤M), the
i-th of these lines should contain three space-separated integers
a
i
,
b
i
and
c
i
(pairwise distinct;
1≤a
i
,b
i
,c
i
≤N) ― the indices on which the
i-th operation is performed.
