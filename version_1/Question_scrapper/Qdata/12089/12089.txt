For a vector
→
v
=(x,y)
, define
|v|=
√
x2+y2
.
Allen had a bit too much to drink at the bar, which is at the origin. There are
n
vectors
→
v1
,
→
v2
,⋯,
→
vn
. Allen will make
n
moves. As Allen's sense of direction is impaired, during the
i
-th move he will either move in the direction
→
vi
or
−
→
vi
. In other words, if his position is currently
p=(x,y)
, he will either move to
p+
→
vi
or
p−
→
vi
.
Allen doesn't want to wander too far from home (which happens to also be the bar). You need to help him figure out a sequence of moves (a sequence of signs for the vectors) such that his final position
p
satisfies
|p|≤1.5⋅106
so that he can stay safe.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the number of moves.
Each of the following lines contains two space-separated integers
xi
and
yi
, meaning that
→
vi
=(xi,yi)
. We have that
|vi|≤106
for all
i
.
Output
Output a single line containing
n
integers
c1,c2,⋯,cn
, each of which is either
1
or
−1
. Your solution is correct if the value of
p=∑
n
i=1
ci
→
vi
, satisfies
|p|≤1.5⋅106
.
It can be shown that a solution always exists under the given constraints.
