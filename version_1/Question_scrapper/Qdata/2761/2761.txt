Given two linked lists of size N and M, which are sorted in non-decreasing order. The task is to merge them in such a way that the resulting list is in decreasing order.
Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input conatains length of both linked lists N and M respectively. Next two lines contains N and M elements of two linked lists.
Output:
For each testcase, print the merged linked list which is in non-increasing order.
User Task:
The task is to complete the function mergeResult() which takes reference to the heads of both linked list and returns the pointer to the merged linked list.
Constraints:
1 <=T<= 50
1 <= N, M <= 1000
Example:
Input:
2
4 3
5 10 15 40 
2 3 20
2 2
1 1
2 4
Output:
40 20 15 10 5 3 2
4 2 1 1 
Explanation:
Testcase 1: After merging the two lists in decreasing order, we have new lists as 40->20->15->10->5->3->2.
