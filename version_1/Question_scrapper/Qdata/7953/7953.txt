You are given an integer
n
.
Find any pair of integers
(x,y)
(
1≤x,y≤n
) such that
xy⋅y+yx⋅x=n
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case contains one line with a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤109
).
Output
For each test case, if possible, print two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤n
). If there are multiple answers, print any.
Otherwise, print
−1
.

Note
In the third test case,
23⋅3+32⋅2=42
, so
(2,3),(3,2)
will be considered as legal solutions.
In the fourth test case,
55⋅5+55⋅5=31250
, so
(5,5)
is a legal solution.
