You are given a permutation
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,…,
𝑝
𝑛
. A permutation of length
𝑛
is a sequence such that each integer between
1
and
𝑛
occurs exactly once in the sequence.
Find the number of pairs of indices
(𝑙,𝑟)
(
1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛
) such that the value of the median of
𝑝
𝑙
,
𝑝
𝑙+1
,…,
𝑝
𝑟
is exactly the given number
𝑚
.
The median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.
For example, if
𝑎=[4,2,7,5]
then its median is
4
since after sorting the sequence, it will look like
[2,4,5,7]
and the left of two middle elements is equal to
4
. The median of
[7,1,2,9,6]
equals
6
since after sorting, the value
6
will be in the middle of the sequence.
Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices
(𝑙,𝑟)
(
1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛
) such that the value of the median of
𝑝
𝑙
,
𝑝
𝑙+1
,…,
𝑝
𝑟
is exactly the given number
𝑚
.
Input
The first line contains integers
𝑛
and
𝑚
(
1≤𝑛≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤𝑚≤𝑛
) — the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.
The second line contains a permutation
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,…,
𝑝
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑝
𝑖
≤𝑛
). Each integer between
1
and
𝑛
occurs in
𝑝
exactly once.
