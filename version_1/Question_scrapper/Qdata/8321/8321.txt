Mainak has an array
a1,a2,…,an
of
n
positive integers. He will do the following operation to this array exactly once:
Pick a subsegment of this array and cyclically rotate it by any amount.
Formally, he can do the following exactly once:
Pick two integers
l
and
r
, such that
1≤l≤r≤n
, and any positive integer
k
.
Repeat this
k
times: set
al=al+1,al+1=al+2,…,ar−1=ar,ar=al
(all changes happen at the same time).
Mainak wants to maximize the value of
(an−a1)
after exactly one such operation. Determine the maximum value of
(an−a1)
that he can obtain.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤50
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2000
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤999
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2000
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum value of
(an−a1)
that Mainak can obtain by doing the operation exactly once.

Note
In the first test case, we can rotate the subarray from index
3
to index
6
by an amount of
2
(i.e. choose
l=3
,
r=6
and
k=2
) to get the optimal array:
[1,3,
9,11,5,7
_
]⟶[1,3,
5,7,9,11
_
]
So the answer is
an−a1=11−1=10
.
In the second testcase, it is optimal to rotate the subarray starting and ending at index
1
and rotating it by an amount of
2
.
In the fourth testcase, it is optimal to rotate the subarray starting from index
1
to index
4
and rotating it by an amount of
3
. So the answer is
8−1=7
.
