Chef is here with another matrix
A having
N rows and
M columns,
such that
A
(i,j)
=(i−1)⋅M+j.
Chef decided to make this matrix interesting. He performed
K operations on the matrix. In each operation, he will choose either a row or column and multiply all values in that row/column with a non-negative integer
V.
An operation is of the form
Q,X,V:
If
Q=0: Multiply each element of the
X
th
row with
V.
If
Q=1: Multiply each element of the
X
th
column with
V.
Find the sum of all values in the matrix after all
K operations are done. Since the value can be large, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M, and
K — the number of rows, columns, and the operations to be done, respectively.
The next
K lines describe the operations. The
i
th
of these
K lines contain three space-separated integers
Q
i
,
X
i
, and
V
i
, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the sum of all elements of the matrix after performing the operations, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1 : The initial matrix is
[[1,2],[3,4]].
In the first operation, multiply all elements of the second column with
0. Thus, the matrix becomes
[[1,0],[3,0]].
In the second operation, multiply all elements of the first row with
2. Thus, the matrix becomes
[[2,0],[3,0]].
The sum of the elements of the updated matrix is
2+3=5.
Test case
2: The initial matrix is
[[1,2,3]].
In the first operation, multiply all elements of the second column with
6. Thus, the matrix becomes
[[1,12,3]].
The sum of the elements of the updated matrix is
1+12+3=16.
