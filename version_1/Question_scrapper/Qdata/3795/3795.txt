A bulb company claims that the average lifetime of its bulbs is at least
X units.
The company ran a test on
N bulbs. You are given the lifetime of
N−1 of these bulbs. What is the minimum non-negative integer value of lifetime the remaining bulb can have, such that the claim of the company holds true?
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
X - denoting the number of test bulbs and the minimum average lifetime of bulbs in the company's claim.
The second line of each test case contains
N−1 space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N−1
denoting the lifetimes of
N−1 of the test bulbs.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the minimum non-negative integer value of lifetime the remaining bulb can have such that the claim of the company holds true.

Explanation:
Let
Y denote the value of the lifetime of the remaining bulb.
Test case 1: The remaining bulb must have lifetime no less than
6 units. The average lifetime with
Y=6 is
3
(1+5+6)
=4≥X. It can be proven that for any non-negative integer value of
Y<6 it is not possible to have an average lifeftime of at least
X=4.
Test case 2: The average lifetime with
Y=0 is
4
(5+8+6+0)
=4.75≥X. Thus the minimum non negative value which satisfies the condition is
Y=0.
