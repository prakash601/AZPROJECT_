Naruto has recently joined the Ninja Academy for higher education, while filling the admission form he is required to choose minimum
X subjects out of a list of
N subjects. He is not very interested in studies but wants to get a good overall CPI. However, every subject has a different weightage/credit. The credit (denoted as
Ci) of a particular course is equal to the position in which it appears in the subject list, i.e, the first course has a credit=1, the second course has a credit=2, and so on. Naruto knows his capabilities, and so he has come up with the scores (
Si) he can achieve in every course. He wants to maximise his CPI, which can be calculated as the weighted mean of all the subjects taken, denoted as Sum(Ci*Si)/Sum(Ci) for all i s.t Naruto has taken up course i
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of every test case contains two integers,
N and
X
Next line of the test case contains
N space separated integers Si, denoting the score he can get in every subject
###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum cpi he can get after choosing the subjects. Your output will be considered correct if it has an absolute error of less than 10-6.
###Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤1000
1≤X≤N
1≤Si
≤10000
###Sample Input: 1
5 2
50 40 30 20 10
###Sample Output: 43.3333333333
###Explanation: He can achieve the max credit by picking the first two subjects, which produces a CPI of (50 * 1+40 * 2)/(1+2) = 43.333333333
