It's the soccer match finals in Chefland and as always it has reached the penalty shotouts. Each team is given
5 shots to make and the team scoring a goal on the maximum number of shots wins the game. If both the teams' scores are equal, then the game is considered a draw and we would have
2 champions.
Given ten integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
10
, where the odd indexed integers(
A
1
,A
3
,
A
5
,
A
7
,A
9
) represent the outcome of the shots made by team
1 and even indexed integers(
A
2
,A
4
,A
6
,A
8
,A
10
) represent the outcome of the shots made by team
2 (here
A
i
=1 indicates that it's a goal and
A
i
=0 indicates a miss), determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains ten space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
10
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer -
0 if the game ends in a draw or
1 if the first team wins or
2 if the second team wins.

Explanation:
Test case
1: No team scores any goal, so the game ends in a draw.
Test case
2: The second team is able to score in their final shot, while the first team has scored 0 goals and hence the second team wins.
Test case
3: The first team is successfully able to make their first
2 shots count and whereas the second team has not scored any goals. Therefore the first team wins.
Test case
4: Team
2 misses their final shot and hence team
1 wins the game with the final score of
5−4.
