You are given a tree rooted at node
1 with
N vertices. The
i
th vertex initially has value
A
i
(1≤i≤N). You are also given
Q queries.
In each query you are given a vertex
V. Let
S={S
1
,S
2
,...S
x
} denote the set of vertices such that
S
i
is in the subtree of
V, distance between
S
i
and
V is even and
S
i

=V for all
i. For all
S
i
, add
A
S
i
to
A
V
and change the value of
A
S
i
to zero.
Find the values of all the vertices after all queries are performed.
Note-The distance between two vertices is defined as the number of edges traversed on the shortest path from one vertex to the other.
Input:
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contain two integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space separated integers,
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
n
denoting the initial values of the vertices.
The next
N−1 lines contain two integers
u and
v denoting an edge between
uand
v.
The next
Q lines contain a single integer which is the query.
Output:
Print a single line containing
N integers for each test case which is the final values of the vertices.
###Constraints:

The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
200000.
The sum of
Q over all test cases does not exceed
200000.

###Sample Output 13 5 0 0
###Explanation
Node
3 has no child in its subtree which is at an even distance so there is no change in the values. Values of nodes after
1st query:
6,2,7,3.
Node
4 is at an even distance in the subtree of node
2 so
A
4
gets added to
A
2
and
A
4
becomes 0. Values of nodes after
2nd query:
6,5,7,0.
Node
3 is at an even distance in the subtree of node
1 so
A
3
gets added to
A
1
and
A
3
becomes 0. Values of nodes after
3rd query:
13,5,0,0.
