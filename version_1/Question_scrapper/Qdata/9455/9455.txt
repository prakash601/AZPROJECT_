After hearing the story of Dr. Zhang, Wowo decides to plan his own flight around the world.
He already chose
n
checkpoints in the world map. Due to the landform and the clouds, he cannot fly too high or too low. Formally, let
bi
be the height of Wowo's aircraft at checkpoint
i
,
x
−
i
≤bi≤x
+
i
should be satisfied for all integers
i
between
1
and
n
, where
x
−
i
and
x
+
i
are given integers.
The angle of Wowo's aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a
90
-degree climb. Formally,
y
−
i
≤bi−bi−1≤y
+
i
should be satisfied for all integers
i
between
2
and
n
, where
y
−
i
and
y
+
i
are given integers.
The final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns. Formally,
z
−
i
≤(bi−bi−1)−(bi−1−bi−2)≤z
+
i
should be satisfied for all integers
i
between
3
and
n
, where
z
−
i
and
z
+
i
are given integers.
Taking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose. Please help Wowo decide whether there exists a sequence of real numbers
b1,…,bn
satisfying all the contraints above.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤66666
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤100000
).
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
x
−
i
,
x
+
i
(
−108≤x
−
i
≤x
+
i
≤108
) denoting the lower and upper bound of
bi
.
The
i
-th of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
y
−
i+1
,
y
+
i+1
(
−108≤y
−
i+1
≤y
+
i+1
≤108
) denoting the lower and upper bound of
bi+1−bi
.
The
i
-th of the next
n−2
lines contains two integers
z
−
i+2
,
z
+
i+2
(
−108≤z
−
i+2
≤z
+
i+2
≤108
) denoting the lower and upper bound of
(bi+2−bi+1)−(bi+1−bi)
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
200000
.
It is guaranteed that relaxing every constraint by
10−6
(i.e., decrease
x
−
i
,y
−
i
,z
−
i
by
10−6
and increase
x
+
i
,y
+
i
,z
+
i
by
10−6
) will not change the answer.
Output
For each test case, output YES if a sequence
b1,…,bn
satisfying the constraints exists and NO otherwise. The sequence
b1,…,bn
is not required.

Note
In the first test case, all
bi
's are in
[0,1]
. Because of the constraints
1=y
−
2
≤b2−b1≤y
+
2
=1
,
b2−b1
must be
1
. So
b2=1
and
b1=0
must hold. Then by
1=y
−
3
≤b3−b2≤y
+
3
=1
,
b3
equals
2
. This contradicts the constraint of
b3≤1
. So no solution exists.
In the second test case, we can let all
bi
's be
0
.
In the third test case, one possible solution is
b1=0
,
b2=1/3
,
b3=2/3
,
b4=1
.
