You have been given an assignment by your computer teacher. You need to study interactions among large numbers of very small charged particles. There are N charged particles at regular spacing along a straight line. They can be modelled as the integer points {1,2,....N} on the real line. At every point j, there is a particle with charge Qj (this could be positive or negative).
The total net force on particle j, by Coulomb's Law, is equal to
You need to compute total force on each particle. For sake of convenience you can take C=50.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of charged particles.
The ith of the next N lines each contain one real number denoting the charge of the ith particle, ie . Qj
Output
Print N real numbers (force on each charge), one in each line. The ith line should contain Fj.
The absolute error should be less than 10-2.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
10 ≤ |Qi| ≤ 1001
Input charges will be given in standard decimal notation. There will be exactly 4 digits after the decimal point in the input charges.
Example
Input:
2
10.0121
-81.0100
Output:
40554.011050
-40554.011050
Explanation
We are given two opposite charged particles. The particle at 1 has charge 10.0121 and the particle at 2 has charge -81.0100. Applying the formula, we get the answer. Note that in this case, the output is equal and opposite in nature.
