Gru has been ordering the minions to do a lot of work lately. Minions don't want to trust Gru anymore. So, they propose a problem to Gru. They will only help Gru if he can answer the problem correctly. The minions generate an endless string
s by following these steps:
Let
s be an empty string.
i=1.
Append
i a s to the back of
s.
Append
i b s to the back of
s.
Multiply
i by
2 and go back to the third step.
So
s will be abaabbaaaabbbb.... Now let's define
f(x) as number of distinct palindrome substring segments in
s[1…x]. For example,
f(3)=4 because a (which is
s[1…1]), b (which is
s[2…2]), a (which is
s[3…3]) and aba (which is
s[1…3]) are possible palindrome substrings of
s[1…3].
The minions will give an integer
N. Help Gru calculate (
∑
i=1
N
f(i))mod(10
9
+7).
Note: We are using 1-indexing.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, which has one integer,
N.
###Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the answer modulo
(10
9
+7).
###Constraints
1≤T≤10
3
1≤N≤10
18
###Sample Input: 1 3
###Sample Output: 7
###EXPLANATION:
f(1)=1,
f(2)=2,
f(3)=4. And so, the answer for
N=3 is
1+2+4=7.
