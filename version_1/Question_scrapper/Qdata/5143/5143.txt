There are
N hidden integer arrays of length
N each. You are given the mex of each of these
N arrays.
Ashish likes lower bounds and Kryptonix likes upper bounds. So, for each
0≤i≤N−1, find:
The least possible number of occurrences of
i across all the arrays
The most possible number of occurrences of
i across all the arrays
Note that these values must be computed independently, i.e, it is allowed to choose different configurations of arrays to attempt to minimize/maximize the number of occurrences of different integers.
Please see the samples for an example.
Recall that the mex of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in it. For example, the mex of
[0,2,4,1,1,5] is
3, and the mex of
[3,8,101,99,100] is
0.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

N arrays.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N lines, each containing two space-separated integers. The
i-th line should contain the least and the most possible number of occurrences of
i across all the arrays.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have the following:
For
i=0, the two arrays can be
[0,3] and
[2,4] giving us one zero, or
[0,0] and
[3,1] giving us
2 zeros.
For
i=1,
[0,4] and
[3,4] give no ones, while
[0,9] and
[1,1] give
2 ones.
Test case
3: We have the following:
For
i=0, the arrays
[0,3,2],[1,0,4],[5,0,2] give the least number of zeros (i.e,
3), and the arrays
[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,0,0] give the most.
For
i=1, the arrays
[5,7,0],[0,3,1],[6,0,3] give the least number of ones and the arrays
[0,3,2],[1,1,0],[5,0,2] give the most.
For
i=2, the arrays
[3,0,9],[0,0,1],[0,0,0] give the least number of twos and the arrays
[2,0,2],[0,1,0],[2,2,0] give the most.
