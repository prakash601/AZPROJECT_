Given a tree containing
N nodes.
Each node can be coloured using exactly one of the
C colours. Find the number of colourings of the tree such that:
All nodes in a path of length at most two have distinct colours.
As the answer can be huge, print it modulo
(10
9
+7).
Note:
Two colourings of a tree are different if there exists at least one node having different colours in both the colourings.
A path in a tree is a sequence of (zero or more) connected nodes.
The path length between two nodes is defined as the total number of edges in the shortest path from one node to other.
Input Format
The first line of the input will contain two integers
N and
C, the number of nodes in the tree and the number of colours available respectively.
The next
(N−1) lines will describe the given tree. Each line contains two integers
U and
V meaning that there is an edge between node
U and node
V.
Output Format
Output the number of ways to colour the tree satisfying the given condition, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
The valid colourings of nodes
1,2, and
3 are:
{1,2,3},{1,3,2},{2,1,3},{2,3,1},{3,1,2}, and
{3,2,1}.
Paths having length at most
2 are:
1−2,1−3, and
2−1−3. Note that for any valid colouring, all the nodes in each of these paths have distinct colours.
