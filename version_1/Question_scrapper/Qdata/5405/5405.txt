Chef placed
N boxes (numbered
1 through
N) in a straight line. For each valid
i, the
i-th box contains
A
i
balls.
Then, Chef painted the boxes using
M distinct colours in such a way that for each
M consecutive boxes, no two of these boxes have the same colour.
Help Chef choose
M distinct boxes (not necessarily consecutive) such that no two of the chosen boxes have the same colour and the difference between the number of balls in a box that contains the maximum number of balls and a box that contains the minimum number of balls among the chosen boxes is the smallest possible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible difference between the maximum and minimum number of balls in the chosen boxes.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Let's denote the colours by 'R' (red) and 'G' (green). There are two possible ways of painting the boxes: "RGRG" and "GRGR".
There are four ways to choose two boxes (one red and one green box). The numbers of balls in them and the differences are:
(10,28) with difference
28−10=18
(10,20) with difference
20−10=10
(15,28) with difference
28−15=13
(15,20) with difference
20−15=5, which is the smallest possible
