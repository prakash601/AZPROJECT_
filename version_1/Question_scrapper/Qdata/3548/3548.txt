Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef has
30 minutes of free time, which is easily enough to finish watching a
24-minute episode. Hence, the answer is Yes.
Test case
2: Chef has
23 minutes of free time, which is not enough to finish watching a
24-minute episode. Hence, the answer is No.
Test case
3: Chef has
60 minutes of free time, which is easily enough to finish watching a
24-minute episode. Hence, the answer is Yes.
Test case
4: Chef has
24 minutes of free time. He will finish watching the episode exactly when the exam starts, and not strictly before it. Hence, the answer is No.
