You are given a tree with
N nodes. For each unordered pair of distinct nodes
(i,j) such that there is no edge between nodes
i and
j, we add an edge between these nodes with probability
1/2.
For each
i (
1≤i≤N), let
p
i
be the probability that the resulting graph has exactly
i 2-edge-connected components and let
R
i
=p
i
⋅2
(N−1)(N−2)/2
. You should compute
R
i
modulo
10

+7 for each
i from
1 to
N.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
Each of the next
−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
and
denoting an edge between vertices
u and
v.
Output
Print a single line containing
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
The only edge that can be added is
(1,3). If this edge is added, there will be one biconnected component; otherwise, there will be three biconnected components. Therefore,
