Ridhiman challenged Ashish to find the maximum valued subsequence of an array
a
of size
n
consisting of positive integers.
The value of a non-empty subsequence of
k
elements of
a
is defined as
∑2i
over all integers
i≥0
such that at least
max(1,k−2)
elements of the subsequence have the
i
-th bit set in their binary representation (value
x
has the
i
-th bit set in its binary representation if
⌊
x
2i
⌋mod2
is equal to
1
).
Recall that
b
is a subsequence of
a
, if
b
can be obtained by deleting some(possibly zero) elements from
a
.
Help Ashish find the maximum value he can get by choosing some subsequence of
a
.
Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integer
n
(1≤n≤500)
 — the size of
a
.
The next line consists of
n
space-separated integers — the elements of the array
(1≤ai≤1018)
.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum value Ashish can get by choosing some subsequence of
a
.

Note
For the first test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence
{2,3}
of size
2
. The binary representation of
2
is 10 and that of
3
is 11. Since
max(k−2,1)
is equal to
1
, the value of the subsequence is
20+21
(both
2
and
3
have
1
-st bit set in their binary representation and
3
has
0
-th bit set in its binary representation). Note that he could also pick the subsequence
{3}
or
{2,1,3}
.
For the second test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence
{3,4}
with value
7
.
For the third test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence
{1}
with value
1
.
For the fourth test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence
{7,7}
with value
7
.
