In the new world, we also have a new system called Cybalphabit system. The system assigns points to each Latin lowercase alphabet as follows:- 'a' is assigned
2
0
, 'b' is assigned
2
1
, 'c'
2
2
and so on. Thus, finally 'z' is assigned
2
25
points.
A Cyberstring is a sequence of lowercase Latin alphabets.
Now, the total score of a Cyberstring will be the sum of points of its characters. You will be given two integers
N and
K. Construct a Cyberstring
X of length
N with total score
K or print
−1 if it is not possible to form the Cyberstring (
X). If there are multiple answers, print any.
###INPUT:
First line contains
T, the number of test cases.
Each of the next
T lines denotes a different test case :
The
(i+1)
th
line denotes the
i
th
test case, and contains two integers
N and
K, the length of the string that is to be constructed, and the score of the string respectively.
###OUTPUT:
For each test case, provide the output on a different line.
Output the required string
X, if one exists, otherwise output
−1.
###Constraints:-
1≤T≤10

1≤n≤10

1≤k≤5∗10

The sum of
n over all test cases is less than

Explanation:
In the first test case,
n=2 and
k=2. So,we have to construct a string of length
2 with total score
2. It can be easily seen that the only possible string is "aa". Its total score will be equal to
2
0
+2
0
=2.
In the second case, "ac" will have score
2
0
+2
2
=5. Obviously, "ca" will also have the same score and is also a possible answer.
In the fourth test case, it can be shown that there is no possible string which satisfies the conditions.
