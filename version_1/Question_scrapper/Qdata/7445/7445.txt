You are given three arrays
A,
B, and
C, all of length
N. You also have two integers
k
1
and
k
2
.
For every index
1≤i≤N, you must choose exactly one of
A
i
,B
i
, or
C
i
. Find the maximum possible sum of chosen elements, such that:
At most
k
1
elements are picked from
A, and
At most
k
2
elements are picked from
B
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of five lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains the integer
— the length of the arrays.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
