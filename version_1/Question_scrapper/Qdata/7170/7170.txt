This is an interactive problem.
Joshua is hiding a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, where
N is even. He wants to play a game with you. Your goal is to guess the sequence.
First, Joshua tells you
A
1
and
A
N
. Then, you should ask him queries. In each query, you choose four integers
L
1
,
R
1
,
L
2
and
R
2
such that
1≤L
1
<R
1
≤N and
1≤L
2
<R
2
≤N, and Joshua's answer is the maximum of
A
L
1
,A
L
1
+1
,…,A
R
1
minus the minimum of
A
L
2
,A
L
2
+1
,…,A
R
2
.
Can you find the sequence using no more than
2N queries?
Interaction
First, you should read a line containing three space-separated integers
N,
A
1
and
A
N
.
Then you may ask queries. To ask a query:
Print a line containing the character 'Q' followed by a space and four space-separated integers
L
1
,
R
1
,
L
2
and
R
2
.
Then, read a line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.
When you think you know the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!' followed by a space and
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
describing your guess.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Example
You                         Grader
                            4 1 1
Q 1 2 3 4
                            1
Q 3 4 1 3
                            2
! 1 2 3 1
Explanation
Joshua has the sequence
[1,2,3,1].
For the first query, the maximum of
A
1
,A
2
is
2 and the minimum of
A
3
,A
4
is
1, so the answer to this query is
2−1=1.
For the second query, the maximum of
A
3
,A
4
is
3 and the minimum of
A
1
,A
3
is
1, so the answer is
3−1=2.
Finally, we correctly guess the sequence by printing "! 1 2 3 1".
