Given an integer N, you can apply a operation on
N multiple times(possibly 0).
Operation is defined as follows:
Choose a positive integer
K such that
K has exactly
4 divisors and
K is a divisor of
N.
Change
N to
N/K.
Find the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number
N.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integers
N.
Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We cannot divide
N=3 by any valid
K and hence output is
2 as
N=3 has exactly two divisors
1 and
3.
Example case 2:
N=64 can be divided by
8 twice as
8 has exactly
4 divisors (
1,
2,
4,
8 ) and hence the resultant value of
N will be
1 and
1 has only
1 divisor hence answer is
1.
Example case 3: We can divide
N=30 by
6,
10 or
15 as all three of them have exactly
4 divisors. In each case resultant value of
N will be either
5,
3 or
2. And all three of them has exactly
2 divisors and they cannot be divided further. Hence the output is
2.
Example case 4: One of the optimal ways to divide
N=120 is divide
120 by
8 followed by dividing by
15. The resultant value will be
120/8=15 and
15/15=1. The number
1 has exactly one divisor and hence output is
1.
Note that, If we divided
N=120 by
6 then we won't get the optimal answer.
Example case 5: We can divide
N=45 by
15 and resultant value of
N will be
3. The number
3 has exactly
2 divisors and hence output is
2
