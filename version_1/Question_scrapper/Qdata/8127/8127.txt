An array
b
of
m
positive integers is good if for all pairs
i
and
j
(
1≤i,j≤m
),
max(bi,bj)
is divisible by
min(bi,bj)
.
You are given an array
a
of
n
positive integers. You can perform the following operation:
Select an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and an integer
x
(
0≤x≤ai
) and add
x
to
ai
, in other words,
ai:=ai+x
.
After this operation,
ai≤1018
should be satisfied.
You have to construct a sequence of at most
n
operations that will make
a
good. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such a sequence of operations always exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
space-separated integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — representing the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test, output a single integer
p
(
0≤p≤n
) — denoting the number of operations in your solution.
In each of the following
p
lines, output two space-separated integers —
i
and
x
.
You do not need to minimize the number of operations. It can be proven that a solution always exists.

Note
In the first test case, array
a
becomes
[5,5,5,5]
after the operations. It is easy to see that
[5,5,5,5]
is good.
In the second test case, array
a
is already good.
In the third test case, after performing the operations, array
a
becomes
[10,5,350,5,10]
, which is good.
In the fourth test case, after performing the operations, array
a
becomes
[60,10,20]
, which is good.
