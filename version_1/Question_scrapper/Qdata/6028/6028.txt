You are given an array
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] containing
N integers.
Consider any subarray
[A
L
,A
L+1
,…,A
R
] of this subarray (where
1≤L≤R≤N). Ther weirdness of this subarray, denoted
w(L,R), is defined to be the number of indices
L≤i≤R such that
A
i
equals the number of occurrences of
A
i
in this subarray.
Formally, we define
w(L,R) for
1≤L≤R≤N as follows:
For every integer
x, let
f
L,R
(x) denote the number of indices
L≤j≤R such that
A
j
=x.
w(L,R) then equals the number of
L≤i≤R such that
A
i
=f
L,R
(A
i
)
For example, let
A=[1,3,5,2,1,2,9,5]. Then,
w, which can be computed as follows. We have
f
1,8
(1)=2
f
1,8
(2)=2
f
1,8
(3)=1
f
1,8
(5)=2
f
1,8
(9)=1
The only indices which satisfy
f
1,8
(A
i
)=A
i
are
i=4 and
i=6, and hence
w(1,8)=2.
w(3,5)=1 — the subarray is
[5,2,1], and each of
1,2,5 occur exactly once in this subarray. Of these, only
1 equals the number of its occurrences in this subarray.
Given
A, your task is to compute the sum of the weirdness of all subarrays of
A, i.e, the value
∑
L=1
N
∑
R=L
N
w(L,R)
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, the size of the given array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the elements of
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer — the sum of the weirdness of all subarrays of the given array.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The only subarray with non-zero weirdness is the whole array, which has
w(1,3)=3 because every value is
3 and it appears thrice.
Test Case 2: There are
10 subarrays. Their weirdness values are as follows:
w(1,1)=1, because
A
1
=1 and
f
1,1
(1)=1.
w(1,2)=1, because
A
1
=1 and
f
1,2
(1)=1; but
A
2
=2 and
f
1,2
(2)=1

=2.
w(1,3)=0, here
f
1,3
(1)=2

=1 and
f
1,3
(2)=1

=2 so no index satisfies the condition.
w(1,4)=2, here indices
2 and
4 satisfy the condition.
w(2,2)=0
w(2,3)=1, index
3 satisfies the condition.
w(2,4)=3, all indices satisfy the condition.
w(3,3)=1
w(3,4)=1, index
3 satisfies the condition.
w(4,4)=0
