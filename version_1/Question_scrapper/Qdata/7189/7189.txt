Reyaan has given you the following problem to solve:
You are given an integer
K in base
B, represented by an array
A of length
N such that
0≤A
i
<B for every
1≤i≤N
∑
i=1
N

⋅B
N−i
=K
Note that
N≤B in this problem.
Find the smallest non-negative integer
X such that
X+K contains every digit from
0 to
B−1 in its base-
B representation.
X can be very large, so print the answer modulo
10
9
+7.
Note: Leading zeros are not counted as part of the number, so for example
12=012 has only two distinct digits:
1 and
2. However,
102 does have three distinct digits.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
B — the size of the array
A and the base.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the value of
X, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All the digits from
0 to
B−1=3 are already present in the given array, so
X=0.
Test case
2: In base
5,
[1,2,3,4] represents the integer
194. The smallest number larger than the given one that contains every digit is
[1,0,2,3,4], which represents
694. The difference between them is
500.
Test case
3: We have
K=3, which is
[1,1] in binary. If we add
X=1 to it, we obtain
K+X=4, which is
[1,0,0] in binary and has both digits.
