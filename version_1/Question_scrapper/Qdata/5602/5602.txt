The Chef has been hunting for a machine developed to change numbers in a rather peculiar manner. This machine has a fixed number
c associated with it and a changing number
X.
In a single step, the Chef can do the following:
First, choose any positive integer
b that is a perfect
c-th power of some number (that is, there is some positive integer
n such that
b=n
c
)
Then, change
X→
gcd(b,X)
lcm(b,X)
He wants to find the minimum number he can change
X into by applying these operations alone any number of times (possibly none at all). However, he does not know the exact values of
X,c for the machine, but he does have
T guesses for what these values might be. For each of these guesses, compute the minimum number Chef can obtain.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T, the number of guesses Chef has for the pair
(X,c). Then the guesses follow.
Each guess consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers
X,c.
Output Format
For each guess, print on a new line the minimum value that Chef can change
X into by applying any number of operations (possibly none at all).

Explanation:
Guess
1: It can easily be checked that
X=1 cannot be changed.
Guess
2: Choose
b=10
1
and change
X:10→
gcd(10,10)
lcm(10,10)
=1. This is the minimum possible value of
X.
