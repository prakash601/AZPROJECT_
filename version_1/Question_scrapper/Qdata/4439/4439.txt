You are given two integers
L and
R. Find the smallest non-negative integer
N such that
N%L>N%(L+1)>…>N%(R−1)>N%R.
Here,
% is the modulo operator, so
A%B is the remainder of
A after division by
B. For example,
11%3=2.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest possible
N, or
−1 if no solution exists.
It is guaranteed that when a solution exists, the smallest solution does not exceed

Explanation:
Example case 1:
N=6 satisfies the given condition, since
6%4(=2)>6%5(=1)>6%6(=0). Notice that
N=7 also satisfies the condition, but it is larger.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find a valid solution because for any non-negative integer
N, we have
N%1(=0)≤N%2.
