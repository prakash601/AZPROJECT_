Vupsen and Pupsen were gifted an integer array. Since Vupsen doesn't like the number
0
, he threw away all numbers equal to
0
from the array. As a result, he got an array
a
of length
n
.
Pupsen, on the contrary, likes the number
0
and he got upset when he saw the array without zeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array
b
of length
n
such that
∑
n
i=1
ai⋅bi=0
. Since Vupsen doesn't like number
0
, the array
b
must not contain numbers equal to
0
. Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, so the sum of their absolute values cannot exceed
109
. Please help Vupsen to find any such array
b
!
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The next
2⋅t
lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
) — the length of the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−104≤ai≤104
,
ai≠0
) — the elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case print
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
— elements of the array
b
(
|b1|+|b2|+…+|bn|≤109
,
bi≠0
,
∑
n
i=1
ai⋅bi=0
).
It can be shown that the answer always exists.

Note
In the first test case,
5⋅1+5⋅(−1)=5−5=0
. You could also print
3
−3
, for example, since
5⋅3+5⋅(−3)=15−15=0
In the second test case,
5⋅(−1)+(−2)⋅5+10⋅1+(−9)⋅(−1)+4⋅(−1)=−5−10+10+9−4=0
.
