There are
n
cities in Treeland connected with
n−1
bidirectional roads in such that a way that any city is reachable from any other; in other words, the graph of cities and roads is a tree. Treeland is preparing for a seasonal virus epidemic, and currently, they are trying to evaluate different infection scenarios.
In each scenario, several cities are initially infected with different virus species. Suppose that there are
ki
virus species in the
i
-th scenario. Let us denote
vj
the initial city for the virus
j
, and
sj
the propagation speed of the virus
j
. The spread of the viruses happens in turns: first virus
1
spreads, followed by virus
2
, and so on. After virus
ki
spreads, the process starts again from virus
1
.
A spread turn of virus
j
proceeds as follows. For each city
x
not infected with any virus at the start of the turn, at the end of the turn it becomes infected with virus
j
if and only if there is such a city
y
that:
city
y
was infected with virus
j
at the start of the turn;
the path between cities
x
and
y
contains at most
sj
edges;
all cities on the path between cities
x
and
y
(excluding
y
) were uninfected with any virus at the start of the turn.
Once a city is infected with a virus, it stays infected indefinitely and can not be infected with any other virus. The spread stops once all cities are infected.
You need to process
q
independent scenarios. Each scenario is described by
ki
virus species and
mi
important cities. For each important city determine which the virus it will be infected by in the end.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of cities in Treeland.
The following
n−1
lines describe the roads. The
i
-th of these lines contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤n
) — indices of cities connecting by the
i
-th road. It is guaranteed that the given graph of cities and roads is a tree.
The next line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅105
) — the number of infection scenarios.
q
scenario descriptions follow.
The description of the
i
-th scenario starts with a line containing two integers
ki
and
mi
(
1≤ki,mi≤n
) — the number of virus species and the number of important cities in this scenario respectively. It is guaranteed that
∑
q
i=1
ki
and
∑
q
i=1
mi
do not exceed
2⋅105
.
The following
ki
lines describe the virus species. The
j
-th of these lines contains two integers
vj
and
sj
(
1≤vj≤n
,
1≤sj≤106
) – the initial city and the propagation speed of the virus species
j
. It is guaranteed that the initial cities of all virus species within a scenario are distinct.
The following line contains
mi
distinct integers
u1,…,umi
(
1≤uj≤n
) — indices of important cities.
Output
Print
q
lines. The
i
-th line should contain
mi
integers — indices of virus species that cities
u1,…,umi
are infected with at the end of the
i
-th scenario.
