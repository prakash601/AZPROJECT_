You are given a prime
p and a matrix
M with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
N columns (numbered
1 through
N). For each row
r and column
c, the cell in row
r and column
c can either be empty or contain an integer
M
r,c
. Initially, all cells are empty.
Now you should process
Q queries. In each query, you are given integers
x,
y and
v and you should do the following:
If the cell
(x,y) is empty before this query, put the value
v in it, i.e. set
M
x,y
to
v.
Otherwise, i.e. if the cell
(x,y) is not empty, make this cell empty again. It is guaranteed that in such a case,
M
x,y
=v before this query;
v is provided for convenience.
Afterwards, Chef wants you to find the number of ways to fill all empty cells with (not necessarily the same) integers in such a way that the resulting matrix is curious. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
In particular, when there are no empty cells in the matrix, the answer is
1 if the matrix is curious or
0 if it is not curious.
In a curious matrix:
Each cell contains an integer between
1 and
p−1 inclusive.
For each non-trivial square submatrix
A of
M (a submatrix containing more than one cell), its determinant
∣A∣ is a multiple of
p.
For example, consider the following matrix.
A=
⎣
⎡
1
2
2
2
4
4
1
2
2
⎦
⎤
This matrix is curious. For the prime
p=5, each of the elements of the matrix is in the range
[1,p−1]. Also, the determinant of each non-trivial square submatrix (there are five of them) is a multiple of the given prime ― for example, the determinant of the whole matrix is
0.
B=[
3
1
1
4
]
The above matrix is not a curious matrix for
p=5, since the determinant of the only non-trivial square submatrix (which is the whole matrix) is
11, not a multiple of
p.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers
N,
Q and
p.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers
x,
y and
v describing a query.
Output
After performing each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to form a curious matrix, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
The only non-trivial square submatrix here is the whole matrix.
In the
4-th query, the matrix is completely filled, but it is not curious for
p=5, so the answer is
0.
After the
5-th query, there are
3 filled cells:
(1,1)→3,
(2,1)→1 and
(2,2)→4. The cell
(1,2) is empty and if we want the determinant of the matrix to be divisible by
p=5, we have to put
2 in this cell. Then the determinant is
3⋅4−1⋅2=10.
