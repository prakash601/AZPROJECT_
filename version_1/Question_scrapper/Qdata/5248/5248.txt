Aujasvit just came up with a new game to play with his friends.
N people stand in a circle, each assigned an index from
1 to
N in clockwise order. Then the following operation is done
N−1 times.
The person with the lowest index holds a coin.
Then, the coin then moves to the next person clockwise
M−1 times.
Then, the person who is holding the coin is removed from the circle.
The last person remaining after
N−1 operations is the winner.
Aujasvit has already decided on the integer
M to be used in the game. Before inviting people to play his game, Aujasvit wants to know the winner if the game has
1 player,
2 players,
3 players, ...,
X players. That is, you need to output the winner when
N=1,N=2,...,N=X.
Input Format
The first line of each input contains
T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
M and
X.
Output Format
For each testcase, output
X integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
X
, where
A
i
is the index of the winner if
i people are playing this game.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤M≤10
9
1≤X≤10000
Sum of
X over all testcases is not more than
5⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1:
When there is only
1 player, they are the winner. Therefore player
1 wins.
When there are
2 players, player
2 is removed in the first round. Therefore player
1 wins.
When there are
3 players, player
2 is removed in the first round, and player
3 is removed in the second round. Therefore player
1 wins.
