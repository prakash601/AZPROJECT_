Initially, Chef is at coordinate
0 on X-axis. For each
i=1,2,…,N in order, Chef does the following:
If Chef is at a non-negative coordinate, he moves
i steps backward (i.e, his position's coordinate decreases by
i), otherwise he moves
i steps forward (i.e, his position's coordinate increases by
i).
You are given the integer
N. Find the final position of Chef on the X-axis after
N operations.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the final position of Chef on the X-axis after
N operations.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Initially, Chef is at coordinate
0 on X-axis. As
0 is non-negative, during the first operation Chef moves
1 step backward and reaches the coordinate
−1.
Test case
2: Chef is at coordinate
−1 on X-axis after the first operation. As
−1 is negative, during the second operation Chef moves
2 steps forward and reaches the coordinate
1.
