You are given positive integers
L and
R. You have to find the sum
S=∑
i=L
R
(L∧(L+1)∧…∧i), where
∧ denotes the bitwise AND operation. Since the sum could be large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum
S modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The sum is 1 + 1 AND 2 + 1 AND 2 AND 3 + 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.
Example case 2: The sum is 4 + 4 AND 5 + 4 AND 5 AND 6 + 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND 7 + ... + 4 AND 5 AND ... AND 10 = 4 + 4 + ... + 0 = 16.
