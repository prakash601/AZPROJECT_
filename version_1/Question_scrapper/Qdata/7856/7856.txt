Kirill wants to weave the very beautiful blanket consisting of
𝑛×𝑚
of the same size square patches of some colors. He matched some non-negative integer to each color. Thus, in our problem, the blanket can be considered a
𝐵
matrix of size
𝑛×𝑚
consisting of non-negative integers.
Kirill considers that the blanket is very beautiful, if for each submatrix
𝐴
of size
4×4
of the matrix
𝐵
is true:
𝐴

Kirill asks you to help her weave a very beautiful blanket, and as colorful as possible!
He gives you two integers
𝑛
and
𝑚
.
Your task is to generate a matrix
𝐵
of size
𝑛×𝑚
, which corresponds to a very beautiful blanket and in which the number of different numbers maximized.
Input
The first line of input data contains one integer number
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The single line of each test case contains two integers
𝑛
and
𝑚
(4≤𝑛,𝑚≤200)
— the size of matrix
𝐵
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
𝑛⋅𝑚
does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, in first line output one integer
𝑐𝑛𝑡
(1≤𝑐𝑛𝑡≤𝑛⋅𝑚)
— the maximum number of different numbers in the matrix.
Then output the matrix
𝐵
(0≤
𝐵
𝑖𝑗
<
2
63
)
of size
𝑛×𝑚
. If there are several correct matrices, it is allowed to output any one.
It can be shown that if there exists a matrix with an optimal number of distinct numbers, then there exists among suitable matrices such a
𝐵
that
(0≤
𝐵
𝑖𝑗
<
2
63
)
.

Note
In the first test case, there is only 4 submatrix of size
4×4
. Consider a submatrix whose upper-left corner coincides with the upper-left corner of the matrix
𝐵
:

So, chosen submatrix fits the condition. Similarly, you can make sure that the other three submatrices also fit the condition.
