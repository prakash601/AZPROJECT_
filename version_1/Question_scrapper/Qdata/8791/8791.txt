You are given an array
a
of length
n
. Also you are given
m
distinct positions
p1,p2,…,pm
(
1≤pi≤n
).
A non-empty subset of these positions
T
is randomly selected with equal probability and the following value is calculated:
n
∑
i=1
(ai⋅
min
j∈T
|i−j|).
In other word, for each index of the array,
ai
and the distance to the closest chosen position are multiplied, and then these values are summed up.
Find the expected value of this sum.
This value must be found modulo
998244353
. More formally, let
M=998244353
. It can be shown that the answer can be represented as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≠0
(mod
M
). Output the integer equal to
p⋅q−1
(mod
M
). In other words, output such integer
x
that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q=p
(mod
M
).
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤m≤n≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai<998244353
).
The third line contains
m
distinct integers
p1,p2,…,pm
(
1≤pi≤n
).
For every
1≤i<m
it is guaranteed that
pi<pi+1
.
Output
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Note
In the first test:
If only
1
is choosen, than the value equals to
1⋅0+2⋅1+3⋅2+4⋅3=20
.
If only
4
is choosen, than the value equals to
1⋅3+2⋅2+3⋅1+4⋅0=10
.
If both positions are chosen, than the value equals to
1⋅0+2⋅1+3⋅1+4⋅0=5
.
The answer to the problem is
