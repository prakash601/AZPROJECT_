You are given a string
S
and an array of strings
[t1,t2,…,tk]
. Each string
ti
consists of lowercase Latin letters from a to n;
S
consists of lowercase Latin letters from a to n and no more than
14
question marks.
Each string
ti
has its cost
ci
— an integer number. The value of some string
T
is calculated as
k
∑
i=1
F(T,ti)⋅ci
, where
F(T,ti)
is the number of occurences of string
ti
in
T
as a substring. For example,
F(aaabaaa,aa)=4
.
You have to replace all question marks in
S
with pairwise distinct lowercase Latin letters from a to n so the value of
S
is maximum possible.
Input
The first line contains one integer
k
(
1≤k≤1000
) — the number of strings in the array
[t1,t2,…,tk]
.
Then
k
lines follow, each containing one string
ti
(consisting of lowercase Latin letters from a to n) and one integer
ci
(
1≤|ti|≤1000
,
−106≤ci≤106
). The sum of lengths of all strings
ti
does not exceed
1000
.
The last line contains one string
S
(
1≤|S|≤4⋅105
) consisting of lowercase Latin letters from a to n and question marks. The number of question marks in
S
is not greater than
14
.
Output
Print one integer — the maximum value of
S
after replacing all question marks with pairwise distinct lowercase Latin letters from a to n.
