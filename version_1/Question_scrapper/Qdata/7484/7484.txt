You are given an integer
A. Let's define an infinite sequence
S(A)=A%P,A
2
%P,A
3
%P,…, where
P=10
8
+7 is a prime and
% is the modulo operator.
Let's also define a decreasing sum
D(S) as the sum of all elements of a sequence
S which are strictly smaller than all preceding elements of
S. When
S is a sequence of non-negative integers, the number of such elements is clearly finite.
Find
D(S(A)).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
A.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
D(S(A)).
Constraints
1≤T≤500
2≤A<P

Explanation:
Example case 1: The sequence
S(2) is
2,4,8,…,1,2,… and thus,
D(S(2))=2+1=3.
Example case 2: The sequence is
10
8
+6,1,10
8
+6,1,… and thus,
D(S(10
8
+6))=10
8
+6+1=10

+7.
