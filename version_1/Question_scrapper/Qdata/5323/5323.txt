You are given an array
A consisting of
N Integers which are initially all
0. You are also given an array
B consisting of
N Integers. You have to tell whether you can make
A equal to
B or not by performing the following operation any number of times.
In one operation you can choose exactly
K distinct indices in the array A and increase the value at these indices by
1.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input.
First line contains two Integers
N and
K.
Second line contains
N Integers denoting array
B.
###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line YES if
A can be converted to
B, otherwise print NO.
###Constraints
