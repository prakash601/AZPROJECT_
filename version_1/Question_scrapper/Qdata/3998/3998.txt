You are given an array
A of
N positive and pairwise distinct integers. You can permute the elements in any way you want.
The cost of an ordering
(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
) is defined as
(((A
1
modA
2
)modA
3
)......)modA
N
where
XmodY means the remainder when
X is divided by
Y. You need to find the maximum cost which can be attained through any possible ordering of the elements.
###Input:
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
N.
The second line of each testcase contains
N space-separated integers, the elements of
A.
###Output:
For each testcase, output the maximum possible cost in a new line.

7
Explanation:
The two possible ways to order the elements are [7, 12] and [12, 7]. In the first case, the cost is
7mod12=7 and in the second case the cost is
12mod7=5. Clearly the answer is 7.
