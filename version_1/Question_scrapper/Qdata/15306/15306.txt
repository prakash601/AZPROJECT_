The Little Elephant has array a, consisting of n positive integers, indexed from 1 to n. Let's denote the number with index i as ai.
The Little Elephant wants to count, how many pairs of integers l and r are there, such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n and sequence b = a1a2... alarar + 1... an has no more than k inversions.
An inversion in sequence b is a pair of elements of the sequence b, that change their relative order after a stable sorting of the sequence. In other words, an inversion is a pair of integers i and j, such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ |b| and bi > bj, where |b| is the length of sequence b, and bj is its j-th element.
Help the Little Elephant and count the number of the described pairs.
Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ k ≤ 1018) — the size of array a and the maximum allowed number of inversions respectively. The next line contains n positive integers, separated by single spaces, a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of array a.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
Output
In a single line print a single number — the answer to the problem.
