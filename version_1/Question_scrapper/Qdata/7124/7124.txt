Given an integer
N, find the number of tuples
(w,x,y,z) such that
1≤w,x,y,z≤N and
x
w
+
z
y
is an integer.
For example, if
N=2, the tuple
(1,2,1,2) satisfies both conditions, i.e.
2
1
+
2
1
=1 is an integer, however
(1,1,1,2) does not since
1
1
+
2
1
=1.5 is not an integer.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing one integer,
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print a new line containing a single integer, the answer to that test case.
Constraints
1≤T≤150
1≤N≤1000
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10

Explanation:
Test Case
1: There are
2
4
=16 tuples to consider, out of them the only ones that are invalid are those where one of the fractions is
2
1
and the other is an integer. The valid tuples are
{(1,1,1,1),(1,1,2,1),(1,1,2,2),(1,2,1,2),(2,1,1,1),(2,1,2,1),(2,1,2,2),(2,2,1,1),(2,2,2,1),(2,2,2,2)}.
Test Cases
2 and
3: There are too many tuples to list them in these cases. However, you may verify that among the
3
4
=81 and
7
4
=4901 tuples respectively only
31 and
355 of them satisfy the conditions in the problem statement.
