This is an interactive problem. It means that every time you output something, you must finish with a newline character and flush the output. For example, in C++ use the
fflush(stdout) function, in Java — call
System.out.flush(), in Python —
sys.stdout.flush(), and in Pascal —
flush(output). Only after flushing the output will you be able to read from the input again.
There exists a string of length
N which consists only of W (white) and B (black). Given that there exist
l1,
r1,
l2,
r2 such that (
1≤l1≤r1<r1+1<l2≤r2≤N) and
A[i] = ‘B’ (for
l1≤i≤r1 and
l2≤i≤r2) and
A[i] = ‘W’ (otherwise). These
l1 to
r1 and
l2 to
r2 are considered as two blocks. You have to ask not more than 250 queries to find the values of these
l1,r1,l2,r2.
###Instructions: There will be two types of queries.
1 l r where
l and
r are two integers
1≤l≤r≤N to ask how many blocks (completely or partially lie in between
l and
r both inclusive). A block intersecting with even one index with
[l,r] is said to lie partially. Output of the interactive code will be among 0, 1, 2 which you should read from input.
2 l1 r1 l2 r2 where
l1,r1,l2,r2 are the required values which is the final answer you should print (only once at the end).
###Input : Only input is an integer
N denoting the length of the array.
