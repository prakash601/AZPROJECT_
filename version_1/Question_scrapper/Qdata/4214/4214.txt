Chef's current score is
X. Each second, Chef will find the smallest prime factor of his score and add it to his score.
Determine the minimum time in seconds, after which his score becomes
≥Y.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers
X and
Y, the initial and required score of Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum time in seconds, after which Chef's score becomes
≥Y.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The initial score is
2. Chef needs the score to be at least
23.
The smallest prime factor of
2 is
2. Thus, the score increase to
2+2=4.
The smallest prime factor of
4 is
2. Thus, the score increase to
4+2=6.
Similarly, each time the score would be increased by
2. Thus, after
11 seconds, the score becomes
24, which is
≥23.
Test case
2: The initial score is
9. Chef needs the score to be at least
20.
The smallest prime factor of
9 is
3. Thus, the score increase to
9+3=12.
The smallest prime factor of
12 is
2. Thus, the score increase to
12+2=14.
The smallest prime factor of
14 is
2. Thus, the score increase to
14+2=16.
The smallest prime factor of
16 is
2. Thus, the score increase to
16+2=18.
The smallest prime factor of
18 is
2. Thus, the score increase to
18+2=20.
Thus, after
5 seconds, the score becomes
20, which is
≥20.
