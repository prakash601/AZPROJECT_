You will be given an array A of N non-negative integers. Your task is to find the rightmost non-zero digit in the product of array elements.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4, A = {3, 23, 30, 45}
Output:
5
Explanation:
Product of these numbers 
are 93150.Rightmost 
non-zero digit is 5.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5, A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
2
Explanation:
Product of these numbers 
are 120. Rightmost 
non-zero digit is 2.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function rightmostNonZeroDigit() which takes an array A and returns the rightmost non-zero digit in the product of array elements, if there is no right most non zero digit, then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
