Gintoki has been very lazy recently and he hasn't made enough money to pay the rent this month. So the old landlady has given him a problem to solve instead, if he can solve this problem the rent will be waived. The problem is as follows:
A triplet of integers
(A,B,C) is considered to be special if it satisfies the following properties for a given integer
N :
AmodB=C
BmodC=0
1≤A,B,C≤N
Example: There are three special triplets for
N=3.
(1,3,1) is a special triplet, since
(1mod3)=1 and
(3mod1)=0.
(1,2,1) is a special triplet, since
(1mod2)=1 and
(2mod1)=0.
(3,2,1) is a special triplet, since
(3mod2)=1 and
(2mod1)=0.
The landlady gives Gintoki an integer
N. Now Gintoki needs to find the number of special triplets. Can you help him to find the answer?
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of special triplets.

Explanation:
Test case
1: It is explained in the problem statement.
Test case
2: The special triplets are
(1,3,1),
(1,2,1),
(3,2,1),
(1,4,1),
(4,3,1),
(2,4,2). Hence the answer is
6.
Test case
3: The special triplets are
(1,3,1),
(1,2,1),
(3,2,1),
(1,4,1),
(4,3,1),
(1,5,1),
(5,4,1),
(5,2,1),
(2,4,2). Hence the answer is
9.
