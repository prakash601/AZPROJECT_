Chef is playing a game with his brother Chefu. He asked Chefu to choose a positive integer
N, multiply it by a given integer
A, then choose a divisor of
N (possibly
N itself) and add it to the product. Let's denote the resulting integer by
M; more formally,
M=A⋅N+d, where
d is some divisor of
N.
Chefu told Chef the value of
M and now, Chef should guess
N. Help him find all values of
N which Chefu could have chosen.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
A and
M.
Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer
C denoting the number of possible values of
N. The second line should contain
C space-separated integers denoting all possible values of
N in increasing order.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
C over all test cases does not exceed
