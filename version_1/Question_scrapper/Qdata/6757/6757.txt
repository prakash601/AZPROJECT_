Consider an array
A of length
N. You know that for all
1≤i≤N,
0≤A
i
≤10
5
. We construct an array
B of length
N−1 such that, for all
1≤i≤N−1,
B
i
=min(A
i
,A
i+1
).
You are given the array
B, you need to find out the total number of distinct arrays
A which we could have used to construct the given array
B.
The answer may be large, so you need to find it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N
The second line of each test case contains
N−1 space separated integers - the
th
of which is
i
Output Format
For each testcase(in a new line), output the count of valid possibilities of array
A modulo
10

Explanation:
Test Case
1: All valid arrays
A are of the form
[100,x] and
[x,100] where
100≤x≤10
5
. Therefore, the answer is
(10
5
−100)+(10
5
−100+1)=199801.
Test Case
3: All valid arrays
A are of the form
[10,12,x] and
[10,x,12] where
12≤x≤10
5
. Therefore, the answer is
(10
5
−12)+(10
5
−12+1)=199977.
