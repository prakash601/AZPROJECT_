Chef has recently started learning from the new CodeChef SQL course.
He has a table which initially has
R rows and
C columns. He then adds
E extra rows to it. How many total cells does he have finally?
Input Format
The only line in the input contains three space-separated integers
R,
C, and
E — the number of initial rows, the number of columns, and the number of extra rows added, respectively.
Output Format
Output on a new line, a single integer, which should be the final total number of cells in the table.
Constraints
1≤R≤100
1≤C≤100
1≤E≤100
Sample 1:
Input
Output
5 2 1
12
Explanation:
There are initially
5 rows, and
2 columns. So the initial number of cells was
5∗2=10. Then,
1 extra row was added. So now the table has
6 rows, and
2 columns. So the total number of cells is now
6∗2=12, which is the answer.
Sample 2:
Input
Output
6 10 3
90
Explanation:
There are initially
6 rows, and
10 columns. So the initial number of cells was
6∗10=60. Then,
3 extra rows were added. So now the table has
9 rows, and
10 columns. So the total number of cells is now
9∗10=90, which is the answer.
Sample 3:
Input
Output
1 1 1
2
Explanation:
There are initially
1 rows, and
1 columns. So the initial number of cells was
1∗1=1. Then,
1 extra row was added. So now the table has
2 rows, and
1 columns. So the total number of cells is now
2∗1=2, which is the answer.
Sample 4:
Input
Output
100 100 100
20000
Explanation:
There are initially
100 rows, and
100 columns. So the initial number of cells was
100∗100=10000. Then,
100 extra rows were added. So now the table has
200 rows, and
100 columns. So the total number of cells is now
200∗100=20000, which is the answer.
