Given an empty array A of infinite length and a positive integer K you have to process Q queries of type:
! l r x: Fill the value x in all the empty places in the array from index l to r (both inclusive).
? l r: Print the number of prime factors of K which is also a prime factor of at least one number in A[l], A[l + 1], A[l + 2], … A[r].
###Input
The first line contains two space separated integers K and Q respectively.
Then Q lines follow:
Each of the
i
th
line contains one of the above two types of queries.
###Output
For each query of the second type, print in a new line the answer to that query. i.e. number of prime factors of K which is also a prime factor of at least one number in A[l], A[l + 1], A[l + 2], … A[r].
###Constraints

###Sample Input
20 5
? 1 5
! 3 5 4
? 1 5
! 1 4 15
? 1 5
###Sample Output 0
1
2
###EXPLANATION Initially, all the places in the array are empty. i.e _ _ _ _ _
After first update the array looks like: _ _ 4 4 4
In the range [1, 5] the only factor of 20 which is also a prime factor of at least one number in _ _ 4 4 4 is 2.
After the second update the array looks like: 15 15 4 4 4
In the range [1, 5] the prime factors of 20 i.e. 5 is a prime factor of 15, 15 and 2 is the prime factor of 4, 4, 4.
