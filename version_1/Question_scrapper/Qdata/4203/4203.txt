Chef has an array
A having
N elements. Chef wants to make all the elements of the array equal by repeating the following move.
Choose any integer
K between
1 and
N (inclusive). Then choose
K distinct indices
i

,i
2
,…,i
K
, and increase the values of
A
i

by
1.
Find the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal.
Input Format
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the number of elements in
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers
A

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements of the array equal.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: In the first move, Chef can choose
K=2, and choose the indices
{1,3}. After increasing
A
1
and
A
3
by
1, the array will become
[2,3,2]. In the second move, Chef can choose
K=2, and choose the indices
{1,3}. After increasing
A
1
and
A
3
by
1, the array will become
[3,3,3], and hence all the elements become equal.
Test Case
2: All the elements of the array are equal, hence no move is required.
