You are given two integers
N and
M. Find the number of sequences
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, where each element is an integer between
1 and
M (inclusive) and no three consecutive elements are equal. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid sequences modulo
10
9
+7.
