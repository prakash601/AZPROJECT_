Chef has a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid
i, elements
A
i
and
A
i+1
are considered adjacent, and elements
A
1
and
A
N
are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either
1 or
0.
You may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index
i such that
A
i
=1 and move that
1 to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change
A
i
to
0, choose one of the elements adjacent to
A
i
and increment it by
1.
According to Chef, a sequence is good if all its elements are different from
1. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence
A into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of required operations, or
−1 if it is impossible to make the sequence good.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The sequence is already good, so the answer is zero.
Example case 2: We can make the sequence good in two operations, e.g.
[1,0,1,0]→[0,1,1,0]→[0,0,2,0].
Example case 3: We can make the sequence good in three operations, e.g.
[1,1,0,1,0]→[0,2,0,1,0]→[0,2,1,0,0]→[0,3,0,0,0].
