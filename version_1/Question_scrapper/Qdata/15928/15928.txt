Having watched the commercial, virus Hexadecimal also wanted to get a Domino Carpet and wanted badly to be photographed in front of it. But of course, a virus will never consent to buying a licensed Carpet! So she ordered a truck of dominoes and decided to make such a Carpet herself.
The original Domino Carpet is a field of squares n × m in size. Each square is half of a domino, and can be rotated either vertically or horizontally, independently from its neighbors. Vertically rotated domino halves look like this:
And horizontally rotated halves look like this:
Notice, that some halves looks the same in both rotations, but other halves differ.
Dominoes bought by Hexadecimal are represented by uncuttable chips 1 × 2 in size, which can be laid either vertically or horizontally. If the chip is laid vertically, then both of it's halves should be laid vertically orientated; if the chip is laid horizontally, then both of it's halves should be laid horizontally.
The samples of valid and invalid dominoes laid vertically and horizontally are:
Virus Hexadecimal assembles her own Domino Carpet so that the following conditions are satisfied:
each carpet square is covered by a domino chip, i.e. there are no empty squares;
all domino chips lie entirely within the carpet and don't overlap with each other;
if there is a horizontal domino chip with its left half in column j then there are no horizontal domino chips with their left halves in columns j - 1 or j + 1.
Before starting to assemble her own Domino Carpet, the virus wants to know the number of ways to achieve the intended purpose modulo 109 + 7.
You can assume that the virus has an infinitely large number of dominoes of each type.
Input
The first line contains two integers n and m, separated by a space — the size of the Domino Carpet (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 250). Next 4n + 1 lines contain 4m + 1 symbols.
Each square of the Domino Carpet, which is a domino half, is described by a 3 × 3 square. Symbol 'O' in this square indicates the presence of a point, symbol '.' — its absence.
Each 3 × 3 square is delineated from adjacent squares by symbols '#' as shown in the examples.
It is guaranteed that every box describes the correct half of a domino.
In all pretests the Domino Carpets have the size of 2 × 2 and 4 × 4.
Output
Print a single number, the number of ways to assemble the Domino Carpet modulo 109 + 7, using only standard dominoes of size 1 × 2.
