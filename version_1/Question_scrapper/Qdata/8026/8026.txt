Ecrade bought a deck of cards numbered from
1
to
n
. Let the value of a permutation
a
of length
n
be
n−k+1
min
i=1
 i+k−1
∑
j=i
aj
.
Ecrade wants to find the most valuable one among all permutations of the cards. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅104
)  — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n,k
(
4≤k<n≤105
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅106
.
Output
For each test case, output the largest possible value in the first line. Then in the second line, print
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
, all
ai
are distinct)  — the elements of the permutation that has the largest value.
If there are multiple such permutations, output any of them.
Example
input
Copy
2
5 4
8 4
output
Copy
13
1 4 5 3 2
18
4 2 5 7 8 3 1 6
Note
In the first test case,
[1,4,5,3,2]
has a value of
13
. It can be shown that no permutations of length
5
have a value greater than
13
when
k=4
.
In the second test case,
[4,2,5,7,8,3,1,6]
has a value of
18
. It can be shown that no permutations of length
8
have a value greater than
18
when
k=4
.
