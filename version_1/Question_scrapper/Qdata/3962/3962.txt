An array
A of length
N is said to be pseudo-sorted if it can be made non-decreasing after performing the following operation at most once.
Choose an
i such that
1≤i≤N−1 and swap
A
i
and
A
i+1
Given an array
A, determine if it is pseudo-sorted or not.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each testcase, output YES if the array
A is pseudo-sorted, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

Explanation:
Test case 1: The array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
Test case 2: We can choose
i=2 and swap
A
2
and
A
3
. The resulting array will be
[1,2,3,3], which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Test case 3: It can be proven that the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order in at most one operation.
