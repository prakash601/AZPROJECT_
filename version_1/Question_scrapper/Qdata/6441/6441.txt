Consider the infinite $x$ axis. There are $N$ impacts on this X-axis at integral points ($X_1$,$X_2$,....$X_N$) (all distinct) . An impact at a point $X$i propagates such that at a point $X$0, the effect of the impact is $K^{|X_i - X_0|}$. Given the point $X_0$, $N$ and $K$. Assume the total impact on $X_0$ is $M$, find if it is possible to do so.
Note: You are not required to find the set X
Formally print "yes" if this is possible and "no" if not possible.
Input:
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers $N$,$K$,$M$,$X$0
Output:
The output of each test case is either "yes" or "no"
Constraints

$1\leq N \leq 100$
$1\leq K \leq 1000$
$1\leq M \leq 10^{18}$
$-10^9 \leq X_0 \leq 10^9$
