Let's call a positive integer
M a beautiful number if the following conditions are satisfied:
The decimal representation of
M (without leading zeros) does not contain any zeros.
The sum of squares of all decimal digits of
M is a perfect square.
For example,
1,
4 and
221 are beautiful, but
10 and
333 are not.
You are given a positive integer
N. Find the smallest
N-digit beautiful number or determine that all
N-digit integers are not beautiful.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest
N-digit beautiful number, or
−1 if there is no such number.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤10
6
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10

Explanation:
Example case 1: It is obvious that
1 is the smallest beautiful number.
Example case 2:
34 is beautiful because
