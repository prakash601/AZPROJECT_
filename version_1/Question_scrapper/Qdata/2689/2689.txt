Now, we'll learn the use of sizeof operator in CPP. This operator is a unary type--it takes only one operand as input and outputs the size in bytes of the operand.
You will be given four different variables of different data types: a (int), b (float), c (double), l (long long), d (string). Your task is to do step-wise operations as given below:
1. Divide b by c.
2. Divide b by a.
3. Divide c by a.
4. Add result at step 3 with l.
5. Print the sizeof(result) of each step in a single line. The outputs should be separated by spaces.
6. Print the sizeof(d) and sizeof(d[3]) separated by a space on a new line.
Example:
Input:
a = 1 
b = 2
c = 3
l = 5
d = gfgc
Output:
4 8 4 8
32 1

User Task: 
Your task is to complete the provided function .
Constraints:
1 <= a, b, c <= 106
1 <= l <= 1018
