You are given
m
sets of integers
A1,A2,…,Am
; elements of these sets are integers between
1
and
n
, inclusive.
There are two arrays of positive integers
a1,a2,…,am
and
b1,b2,…,bn
.
In one operation you can delete an element
j
from the set
Ai
and pay
ai+bj
coins for that.
You can make several (maybe none) operations (some sets can become empty).
After that, you will make an edge-colored undirected graph consisting of
n
vertices. For each set
Ai
you will add an edge
(x,y)
with color
i
for all
x,y∈Ai
and
x<y
. Some pairs of vertices can be connected with more than one edge, but such edges have different colors.
You call a cycle
i1→e1→i2→e2→…→ik→ek→i1
(
ej
is some edge connecting vertices
ij
and
ij+1
in this graph) rainbow if all edges on it have different colors.
Find the minimum number of coins you should pay to get a graph without rainbow cycles.
Input
The first line contains two integers
m
and
n
(
1≤m,n≤105
), the number of sets and the number of vertices in the graph.
The second line contains
m
integers
a1,a2,…,am
(
1≤ai≤109
).
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤109
).
In the each of the next of
m
lines there are descriptions of sets. In the
i
-th line the first integer
si
(
1≤si≤n
) is equal to the size of
Ai
. Then
si
integers follow: the elements of the set
Ai
. These integers are from
1
to
n
and distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
si
for all
1≤i≤m
does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of coins you should pay for operations to avoid rainbow cycles in the obtained graph.

Note
In the first test, you can make such operations:
Delete element
1
from set
1
. You should pay
a1+b1=5
coins for that.
Delete element
1
from set
2
. You should pay
a2+b1=6
coins for that.
You pay
11
coins in total. After these operations, the first and the second sets will be equal to
{2}
and the third set will be equal to
{1,2}
.
So, the graph will consist of one edge
(1,2)
of color
3
.
In the second test, you can make such operations:
Delete element
1
from set
1
. You should pay
a1+b1=11
coins for that.
Delete element
4
from set
2
. You should pay
a2+b4=13
coins for that.
Delete element
7
from set
3
. You should pay
a3+b7=13
coins for that.
Delete element
4
from set
4
. You should pay
a4+b4=16
coins for that.
Delete element
7
from set
6
. You should pay
a6+b7=13
coins for that.
You pay
66
coins in total.
After these operations, the sets will be:
{2,3}
;
{1}
;
{1,3}
;
{3}
;
{3,4,5,6,7}
;
{5}
;
{8}
.
We will get the graph:
There are no rainbow cycles in it.
