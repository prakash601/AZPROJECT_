You are given 3 qubits which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:
|ψ0⟩=
1
√
3
(|100⟩+ω|010⟩+ω2|001⟩)
, or
|ψ1⟩=
1
√
3
(|100⟩+ω2|010⟩+ω|001⟩)
, where
ω=e2iπ/3
.
Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was
|ψ0⟩
state or 1 if it was
|ψ1⟩
state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 3 qubits as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {
        // your code here
    }
}
