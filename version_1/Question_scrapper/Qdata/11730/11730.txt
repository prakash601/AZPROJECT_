Buber is a Berland technology company that specializes in waste of investor's money. Recently Buber decided to transfer its infrastructure to a cloud. The company decided to rent CPU cores in the cloud for
n
consecutive days, which are numbered from
1
to
n
. Buber requires
k
CPU cores each day.
The cloud provider offers
m
tariff plans, the
i
-th tariff plan is characterized by the following parameters:
li
and
ri
— the
i
-th tariff plan is available only on days from
li
to
ri
, inclusive,
ci
— the number of cores per day available for rent on the
i
-th tariff plan,
pi
— the price of renting one core per day on the
i
-th tariff plan.
Buber can arbitrarily share its computing core needs between the tariff plans. Every day Buber can rent an arbitrary number of cores (from 0 to
ci
) on each of the available plans. The number of rented cores on a tariff plan can vary arbitrarily from day to day.
Find the minimum amount of money that Buber will pay for its work for
n
days from
1
to
n
. If on a day the total number of cores for all available tariff plans is strictly less than
k
, then this day Buber will have to work on fewer cores (and it rents all the available cores), otherwise Buber rents exactly
k
cores this day.
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers
n
,
k
and
m
(
1≤n,k≤106,1≤m≤2⋅105
) — the number of days to analyze, the desired daily number of cores, the number of tariff plans.
The following
m
lines contain descriptions of tariff plans, one description per line. Each line contains four integers
li
,
ri
,
ci
,
pi
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
,
1≤ci,pi≤106
), where
li
and
ri
are starting and finishing days of the
i
-th tariff plan,
ci
— number of cores,
pi
— price of a single core for daily rent on the
i
-th tariff plan.
Output
Print a single integer number — the minimal amount of money that Buber will pay.
