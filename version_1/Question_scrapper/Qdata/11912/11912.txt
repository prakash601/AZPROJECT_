When Masha came to math classes today, she saw two integer sequences of length
n−1
on the blackboard. Let's denote the elements of the first sequence as
ai
(
0≤ai≤3
), and the elements of the second sequence as
bi
(
0≤bi≤3
).
Masha became interested if or not there is an integer sequence of length
n
, which elements we will denote as
ti
(
0≤ti≤3
), so that for every
i
(
1≤i≤n−1
) the following is true:
ai=ti|ti+1
(where
|
denotes the bitwise OR operation) and
bi=ti&ti+1
(where
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation).
The question appeared to be too difficult for Masha, so now she asked you to check whether such a sequence
ti
of length
n
exists. If it exists, find such a sequence. If there are multiple such sequences, find any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
) — the length of the sequence
ti
.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
a1,a2,…,an−1
(
0≤ai≤3
) — the first sequence on the blackboard.
The third line contains
n−1
integers
b1,b2,…,bn−1
(
0≤bi≤3
) — the second sequence on the blackboard.
Output
In the first line print "YES" (without quotes), if there is a sequence
ti
that satisfies the conditions from the statements, and "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such sequence.
If there is such a sequence, on the second line print
n
integers
t1,t2,…,tn
(
0≤ti≤3
) — the sequence that satisfies the statements conditions.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
In the first example it's easy to see that the sequence from output satisfies the given conditions:
t1|t2=(012)|(112)=(112)=3=a1
and
t1&t2=(012)&(112)=(012)=1=b1
;
t2|t3=(112)|(102)=(112)=3=a2
and
t2&t3=(112)&(102)=(102)=2=b2
;
t3|t4=(102)|(002)=(102)=2=a3
and
t3&t4=(102)&(002)=(002)=0=b3
.
In the second example there is no such sequence.
