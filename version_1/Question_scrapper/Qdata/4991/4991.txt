A Binod is a person who is very good with bitwise operations. Help Alice solve the following problem and become a Binod.
You are given an array
A of
N elements. Process
Q queries on this array, of the following form:
Each query contains
5 integers
k,L
1
,R
1
,L
2
,R
2
. It is guaranteed that
L
1
≤R
1
<L
2
≤R
2
.
The answer to a query is the number of pairs
(i,j) such that:
L
1
≤i≤R
1
and
L
2
≤j≤R
2
A
i
⊕A
j
has its
k-th bit set. Here
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Note: An integer
x is said to have its
k-th bit set if the (unique) binary representation of
x contains
2
k
. For example,
5=101
2
=2
0
+2
2
has its zeroth and second bits set but not the first, while
2
has only its fourth bit set.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q — the number of elements in array and number of queries, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A

The next
Q lines describe queries. The
i-th of these
Q lines contains
5 space-separated integers
k,L

— the parameters described in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output
Q lines.The
i-th of these lines should be the answer to the
i-th query.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The array is
A=[1,2,4,3,2].
Query
1: the ranges are
[1,3] and
[5,5], and
k=1. There are three pairs of
(i,j):
(1,5),(2,5),(3,5).
A

⊕A

=1⊕2=3=11
2
has its first bit set
A

⊕A

=2⊕2=0=0
2
doesn't have its first bit set
A
3
⊕A
5
=4⊕2=6=110
2
has its first bit set
So, the answer is
2.
Query
2: the ranges are
[1,2] and
[3,5], and now
k=2. This time, there are
6 pairs of indices. Of them, it can be verified that
(1,3) and
(2,3) are the ones that satisfy the given condition.
