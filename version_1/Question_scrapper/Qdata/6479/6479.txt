Zawad is a rare competitive programmer — he takes his studies seriously. One day, while studying in a library, he found a pattern
P in a century old book. The pattern is a string of lowercase English letters, with length
M. Since Zawad is a curious boy, he started experimenting with the pattern.
In one experiment, Zawad considers all
26
N
strings with length
N that contain only lowercase English letters. The strings are numbered
0 through
26
N
−1 in lexicographical order. For each valid
i, let
C
i
be the length of the longest prefix of
P which is also a suffix of the
i-th of these strings (
0≤C
i
≤M).
For each integer
k between
0 and
M inclusive, let
S
k
denote the sum of all valid indices
i such that
C
i
=k. Zawad wants to know all these sums, but since they could be huge, it is enough to compute them modulo
998,244,353.
Since Zawad is a bit busy at the library, he is asking for your help. Can you find the sums and earn Zawad's respect?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
M and
N.
The second line contains a single string
P with length
M.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
M+1 space-separated integers
