Given a string S. Count the characters that have ‘N’ number of occurrences. If a character appears consecutively it is counted as 1 occurrence.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "abc", N = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: 'a', 'b' and 'c' all have 
1 occurrence.
â€‹Example 2:
Input: 
S = "geeksforgeeks", N = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 'g', 'e', 'k' and 's' have
2 occurrences.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getCount() which takes the string S and an integer N as inputs and returns the count of the characters that have exactly N occurrences in the string. Note that the consecutive occurrences of a character have to be counted as 1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
1<=N<=103
