Danya has a sequence
A of non-negative integers. Initially,
A has length
N.
Let's define a function
f(x,A), where
x is a positive integer
≤∣A∣, as the maximum of bitwise ANDs of all subsequences of
A with length equal to
x.
Kostya gives Danya
M requests. There are three types of requests:
1v: append an integer
v to
A
2v: delete an element equal to
v from
A; it is guaranteed that
A contains
v at least once, but if there are more elements equal to
v, you should only delete one of them
3x: calculate
f(x,A)
Also, Kostya knows that at any time, all elements of
A are smaller than
2
k
for a fixed
k.
Help Danya process all of Kostya's requests.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
k.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
denoting the initial sequence
A.
Each of the following
M lines contains two space-separated integers describing a request in the format
1v,
2v or
3x.
Output
For each request of type 3, print a single line containing one integer — the value of
f(x,A).
