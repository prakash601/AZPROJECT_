This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of
m
. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.
Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom!
 As a doll collector, Chiori has got
n
dolls. The
i
-th doll has a non-negative integer value
ai
(
ai<2m
,
m
is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are
2n
different picking ways.
Let
x
be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls
x=0
). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of
1
-bits in the binary representation of
x
. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices
0≤i<m
, such that
⌊
x
2i
⌋
is odd.
Tell her the number of picking ways with value
i
for each integer
i
from
0
to
m
. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
,
0≤m≤35
)  — the number of dolls and the maximum value of the picking way.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai<2m
)  — the values of dolls.
Output
Print
m+1
integers
p0,p1,…,pm
 —
pi
is equal to the number of picking ways with value
i
by modulo
998244353
.
