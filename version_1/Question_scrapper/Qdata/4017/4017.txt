Chef has a stick of length
L. Chef wants to break the stick into
K parts such that each part has a non-zero length.
Let the lengths of the
K parts be
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
K
(Note that
A
1
+A
2
+…+A
K
=L and
A
i
is a positive integer for all
i). Chef wants to minimize the value of
i=1
∑
K−1
∣A
i+1
−A
i
∣. Can you help Chef? (Here
∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of
x)
Under the given constraints it will always be possible to break the stick into
K parts of non-zero lengths.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
— the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
K — the initial length of the stick and the number of parts Chef wants to break the stick into.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum value of
i=1
∑
K−1
∣A
i+1
−A
i
∣.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: It is optimal to break the stick of length
4 into
3 parts in the following manner:
[2,1,1]. The value of
i=1
∑
K−1
∣A
i+1
−A
i
∣=∣1−2∣+∣1−1∣=1.
Test Case 2: It is optimal to break the stick of length
2 into
2 parts in the following manner:
[1,1]. The value of
i=1
∑
K−1
∣A
i+1
−A
i
∣=∣1−1∣=0.
