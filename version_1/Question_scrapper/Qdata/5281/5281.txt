You are given a grid with
N rows and
M columns, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'.
Find out whether all the cells containing '1'-s form a rectangle, I.e, is there a rectangular contiguous subgrid such that every cell within it is a '1', and all the cells containing '1'-s are within this subgrid.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains a single string with length
M describing the
i-th row of the grid.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the connected component of '1'-s is a rectangle or "NO" if it is not.
Note: The output is case-insensitive ― each letter may be printed in upper case or lower case.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N,M≤500
Sum of
N∗M over all tests is atmost
1.5∗10
6
Each string contains only characters '0' and '1'
It is guaranteed that grid contains at least a single '1'

Explanation:
Example case 1: The minimal rectangle which covers all '1'-s also covers
4 cells which contain '0'-s.
Example case 2: The minimal rectangle which covers all '1'-s also covers
2 cells which contain '0'-s.
Example case 3: We can form a minimal rectangle with side length
2 which covers all cells containing '1'-s and none of the cells containing '0'-s.
