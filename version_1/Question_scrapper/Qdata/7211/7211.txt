  Prof. Charles: "She is like you. Very much like you !! "
Logan recently understood that Laura is his daughter. Transigen was breeding mutant children using DNA samples from several mutants for the "X-23" project. His own DNA was used.
To save Laura, Logan has to find out how many of his attributes are also present in Laura. He gets access to N strings.
Logan must know the set X(contains unique elements) of unique substrings of all the N strings
Consider 2 strings "abab" and "abac". Set X of all unique substrings of both these strings is -
Prof. Charles asks him Q queries.
In a query, Logan will be provided ID (say P) of one of those N strings (1 ≤ P ≤ N) , and another integer D.
For each query, Logan needs to tell the number of substrings in set X which have Longest Common Prefix ( LCP ) with string P of length greater than or equal to D
  Input
First line of every input file comprises an integer N denoting the number of strings to be input.
N lines follows, each comprising the ith string.- Str[i]
Then an integer Q is input- denoting the number of queries.
Next Q lines contains two integers P and D respectively where P denotes the string ID, and D denotes the required LCP length as stated above
  Output
For each of the Q queries, output the number of substrings of set X which satisfy the condition stated above.
  Constraints
Strings comprise only lowercase characters ['a'-'z']
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ |Str[i]| ≤ 105
Sum of length of all strings will not exceed 106
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ P ≤ N
1 ≤ D ≤ Sum of length of all strings
  Example
Input:
2
abac
abab
2
2 2
1 1
Output:
4
6
  Explanation
For 2nd string - "abab" , there are 4 unique substrings which have LCP with it of length ≥ 2. {ab , aba, abac, abab }
