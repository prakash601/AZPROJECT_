∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of
x)
Note: An array
X is a subarray of an array
Y if
X can be obtained from
Y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Explanation:
In the first test case:-
the given array
B is
[1,−1,1,1] and the given array
A is
[1,2,4,8],.
We need to create array
C by multiplying corresponding elements of
A and
B.
Thus,
C=[1,−2,4,8].
The subarrays of the array
[1,−2,4,8] and their corresponding sum are:
[1]: sum
=1
[1,−2]: sum
=−1
[1,−2,4]: sum
=3
[1,−2,4,8]: sum
=11
[−2]: sum
=−2
[−2,4]: sum
=2
[−2,4,8]: sum
=10
[4]: sum
=4
[4,8]: sum
=12
[8]: sum
=8
So, the number of subarrays having sum strictly greater than
0 is
8, and the number of subarrays having sum strictly less than
0 is
2. Therefore, the answer is
∣8−2∣=6.
In the 4th test case:-
Given the array
A=[1,2] and the array
B=[1,1], we need to create an array
C by multiplying corresponding elements of
A and
B. Thus, we have:
C=[1,2]
The subarrays of the array
C and their corresponding sum are:
[1]: sum
=1
[2]: sum
=2
[1,2]: sum
=3
So, the number of subarrays having sum strictly greater than
0 is
3, and the number of subarrays having sum strictly less than
0 is
0. Therefore, the answer is
∣3−0∣=3.
