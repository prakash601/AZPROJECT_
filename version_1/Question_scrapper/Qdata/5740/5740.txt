A string with length
L is called rich if
L≥3 and there is a character which occurs in this string strictly more than
L/2 times.
You are given a string
S and you should answer
Q queries on this string. In each query, you are given a substring
S
L
,S
L+1
,…,S
R
. Consider all substrings of this substring. You have to determine whether at least one of them is rich.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains a single string
S with length
N.
Each of the next
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
L and
R describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given substring contains a rich substring or "NO" if it does not contain any rich substring.
