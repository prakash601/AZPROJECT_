This Module is all about pointers and how they can be cleverly employed to solve typical CPP problems.
Given two integers A and B. The task is to swap two numbers. Swapping here means to interchange the values of A and B.
  Example 1:
Input:
A = 3 
B = 5
Output: 
5 3
Explanation:
Here, A = 3 and B = 5.
After swapping A = 5 and B = 3.
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the two swap() functions, such that values of A and B gets interchanged.
Constraints:
1 <= A, B <= 106
