In a recent breakthrough, sequences which do not have Arithmetic Progressions (APs) of size 3, were studied. Let us try a simple problem related to that.
Consider a sequence
A
1
≤A
2
≤…≤A
n
. Three elements from it, say
A
i
,A
j
,A
k
, where
i<j<k, are said to form an AP, if
(A
j
−A
i
)=(A
k
−A
j
). Call the sequence AP-Free, if no such three elements can be found.
Your goal is to find out whether the given sequence is AP-Free or not.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the size of the sequence.
The next line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
n
, which is the sequence.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, "YES", if the sequence is AP-Free. Output "NO" if it is not.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, Yes, yes, YES, and yES are all considered identical.

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The given sequence is
(1,2,3). Here, you can select all the three elements, and they form an AP, since
(2−1)=(3−2)=1. Hence, this sequence is not AP-Free.
Testcase 2: The given sequence is
(1,2,4). No three elements form an AP. Hence, this sequence is AP-Free.
Testcase 3: The given sequence is
(10,25,40). Here, you can select all the three elements, and they form an AP, since
(25−10)=(40−25)=15. Hence, this sequence is not AP-Free.
Testcase 4: The given sequence is
(1,10,11,21). Here, you can select
(A
1
,A
3
,A
4
), and they form an AP, since
(11−1)=(21−11)=10. Hence, this sequence is not AP-Free.
