You are given a binary string
S.
In one second, the following scenario happens simultaneously and independently for all the bits which are set to
1 in the string:
Change the bit from
1 to
0.
If the left neighbour exists and is
0, change it to
1.
If the right neighbour exists and is
0, change it to
1.
For example, if
S=010 initially, then after
1 second,
S=101 (the
1 bit and both its neighbours were changed). After another second,
S=010. Here, the first and the last bit were changed to
0 because earlier they were
1. The middle bit was changed because it was
0 earlier and it was a neighbour of a
1 bit.
Find out the string
S after
K seconds.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the length of string
S and the number of seconds.
The next line describes the string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output the string
S after exactly
K seconds.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The middle bit is changed to
1 since it had a neighbouring set bit (in this case both left and right) and both the set bits are changed to
0. Hence, after one second, it is
101.
Test case
2: After first second, the string
S will be
01010. After another second , the string becomes
10101.
