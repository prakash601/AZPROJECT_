You have an array
a0,a1,…,an−1
of length
n
. Initially,
ai=2i
for all
0≤i<n
. Note that array
a
is zero-indexed.
You want to reverse this array (that is, make
ai
equal to
2n−1−i
for all
0≤i<n
). To do this, you can perform the following operation no more than
250000
times:
Select an integer
i
(
0≤i<n
) and replace
ai
by
ai⊕a(i+1)modn
.
Here,
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Your task is to find any sequence of operations that will result in the array
a
being reversed. It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤400
) — the length of the array
a
.
Output
On the first line print one integer
k
(
0≤k≤250000
) — the number of operations performed.
On the second line print
k
integers
i1,i2,…,ik
(
0≤ij<n
). Here,
ij
should be the integer selected on the
j
-th operation.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations.

Note
In the notes, the elements on which the operations are performed are colored red.
In the first test case, array
a
will change in the following way:
[1,2]→[1,3]→[2,3]→[2,1]
.
In the second test case, array
a
will change in the following way:
[1,2,4]→[1,6,4]→[7,6,4]→[7,2,4]→[5,2,4]→[5,2,1]→[5,3,1]→[6,3,1]→[6,2,1]→[4,2,1]
.
