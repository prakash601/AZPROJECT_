JJ has three integers
N,
A and
B where
0≤A,B<2
N
. He wants to find a third integer
X such that:
0≤X<2
N
the value of
(A⊕X)×(B⊕X) is maximum.
Here
⊕ represents the Bitwise XOR operator.
Can you help him find such an integer
X? If there are multiple integers which satisfy the given conditions, print any.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers
,
and
- the integers mentioned in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output an integer
X which satisfies the given conditions.
If multiple answers exist, print any.
Constraints
1≤T≤5000
1≤N≤30
0≤A,B<2

Explanation:
Test case 1: For
X=1,
(0⊕1)×(0⊕1)=1 which can be proven to be the maximum value of this expression.
Test case 2: For
X=3,
(4⊕3)×(6⊕3)=35 which can be proven to be the maximum value of this expression.
