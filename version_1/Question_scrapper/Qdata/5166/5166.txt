You are given an empty grid with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
M columns (numbered
1 through
M). You should fill this grid with integers in a way that satisfies the following rules:
For any three cells
c
1
,
c
2
and
c
3
such that
c
1
shares a side with
c
2
and another side with
c
3
, the integers written in cells
c
2
and
c
3
are distinct.
Let's denote the number of different integers in the grid by
K; then, each of these integers should lie between
1 and
K inclusive.
K should be minimum possible.
Find the minimum value of
K and a resulting (filled) grid. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
Output
For each test case, print
N+1 lines.
The first line should contain a single integer — the minimum
K.
Each of the following
N lines should contain
M space-separated integers between
1 and
K inclusive. For each valid
i,j, the
j-th integer on the
i-th line should denote the number in the
i-th row and
j-th column of the grid.
Constraints
1≤T≤500
1≤N,M≤50
the sum of
N⋅M over all test cases does not exceed
7⋅10

Explanation:
Example case 1: There is only one cell in the grid, so the only valid way to fill it is to write
1 in this cell. Note that we cannot use any other integer than
1.
Example case 2: For example, the integers written in the neighbours of cell
(2,2) are
1,
2 and
3; all these numbers are pairwise distinct and the integer written inside the cell
(2,2) does not matter. Note that there are pairs of neighbouring cells with the same integer written in them, but this is OK.
