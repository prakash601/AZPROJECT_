You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You may modify it by performing the following operation zero or more times:
Let
K be the length of the LIS of the current sequence
A.
Choose a position in this sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence) and insert a new element
K into this sequence at this position.
This way, the sequence
A changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.
For example, if
A=[3,3,4], then the LIS of
A has length
2, so we can insert
2 anywhere into
A, obtaining one of the sequences
[2,3,3,4],
[3,2,3,4],
[3,3,2,4] or
[3,3,4,2].
Find the maximum length of the LIS of
A that can be obtained after performing the given operation a finite number of times.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible length of the LIS.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We can perform the following operations (the newly inserted elements, which are always equal to the length of the LIS of the previous sequence, are underlined):
