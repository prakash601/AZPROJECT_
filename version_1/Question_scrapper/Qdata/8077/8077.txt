You are given an array
𝑎
of
𝑛
integers.
Find two permutations
†
𝑝
and
𝑞
of length
𝑛
such that
max(
𝑝
𝑖
,
𝑞
𝑖
)=
𝑎
𝑖
for all
1≤𝑖≤𝑛
or report that such
𝑝
and
𝑞
do not exist.
†
A permutation of length
𝑛
is an array consisting of
𝑛
distinct integers from
1
to
𝑛
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
𝑛=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
𝑛
(
1≤𝑛≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
𝑛
integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤𝑛
) — the array
𝑎
.
It is guaranteed that the total sum of
𝑛
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, if there do not exist
𝑝
and
𝑞
that satisfy the conditions, output "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes) and then output
2
lines. The first line should contain
𝑛
integers
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,…,
𝑝
𝑛
and the second line should contain
𝑛
integers
𝑞
1
,
𝑞
2
,…,
𝑞
𝑛
.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case,
𝑝=𝑞=[1]
. It is correct since
𝑎
1
=𝑚𝑎𝑥(
𝑝
1
,
𝑞
1
)=1
.
In the second test case,
𝑝=[1,3,4,2,5]
and
𝑞=[5,2,3,1,4]
. It is correct since:
𝑎
1
=max(
𝑝
1
,
𝑞
1
)=max(1,5)=5
,
𝑎
2
=max(
𝑝
2
,
𝑞
2
)=max(3,2)=3
,
𝑎
3
=max(
𝑝
3
,
𝑞
3
)=max(4,3)=4
,
𝑎
4
=max(
𝑝
4
,
𝑞
4
)=max(2,1)=2
,
𝑎
5
=max(
𝑝
5
,
𝑞
5
)=max(5,4)=5
.
In the third test case, one can show that no such
𝑝
and
𝑞
exist.
