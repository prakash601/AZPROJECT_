Let
f be a permutation of length
N, where
N is even. The riffle of
f is defined to be the permutation
g=(f(1),f(3),…,f(N−1),f(2),f(4),…,f(N))
You are given two integers
N and
K. Output the resultant permutation when you riffle the identity permutation of length
N,
K times.
The identity permutation of length
N is
σ
N
=(1,2,…,N)
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Output Format
For each test case, output the answer permutation as
N space-separated integers in a new line.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Performing the riffle on
σ
6
=(1,2,3,4,5,6) once results in
(1,3,5,2,4,6), by definition.
Test case
2: The process goes as follows:
Performing the riffle on
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) results in
(1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8)
Performing the riffle on
(1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8) results in
(1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8)
