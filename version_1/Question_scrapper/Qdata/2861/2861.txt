Given 3 strings A, B and C, the task is to find the longest common sub-sequence in all three given sequences.
Example 1:
Input:
A = "geeks", B = "geeksfor", 
C = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 5
Explanation: "geeks"is the longest common
subsequence with length 5.
â€‹Example 2:
Input: 
A = "abcd", B = "efgh", C = "ijkl"
Output: 0
Explanation: There's no common subsequence
in all the strings.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function LCSof3() which takes the strings A, B, C and their lengths n1, n2, n3 as input and returns the length of the longest common subsequence in all the 3 strings.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n1*n2*n3).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n1*n2*n3).

Constraints:
1<=n1, n2, n3<=20
