Chef is having a candlelit dinner with his girlfriend at his place. Currently, it is time
0, Chef just managed to light a candle, but he is out of matchsticks.
Since Chef has an infinite supply of (unlit) candles, he can use the following strategy: each second (starting at time
0), he takes one lit candle and lights up
X other candles using it. This process takes
1 unit of time to complete, i.e. if Chef starts lighting up
X candles at a time
t

, he is able to finish at the time
t

+1.
However, since candle wax is limited, a candle can only burn for
Y units of time and then it is extinguished.
Chef's girlfriend arrives at a time
A — specifically, after all the candles that were supposed to get extinguished at time
A have been extinguished and after Chef lights up all the candles that he was lighting up since time
A−1. Now Chef wants to know the maximum number of candles which can be lit at the time
A to impress his girlfriend.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
A,
Y and
X.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of lit candles Chef can impress his girlfriend with.

Explanation:
Example case 1: At the time
0, there is one lit candle, using which we light
1 more candle. At the time
1, the starting candle gets extinguished and the candle which we started lighting up at the time
0 is lit, so we have only
1 candle lit up when Chef's girlfriend arrives.
Example case 2: At the time
0, there is one lit candle, using which we light
1 more candle. At the time
1, the candle which we started lighting up at the time
0 and the starting candle are both lit.
Example case 3: At the time
0, there is one lit candle, using which we light
1 more candle. At the time
1, the candle which we started lighting up at time
0 is lit, and we start lighting up one more candle. At the time
2, the starting candle gets extinguished and the candle which we started lighting up at the time
1 is lit. In total, we have
2 lit candles when Chef's girlfriend arrives.
