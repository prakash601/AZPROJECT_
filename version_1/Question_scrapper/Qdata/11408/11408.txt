There are
m
people living in a city. There are
n
dishes sold in the city. Each dish
i
has a price
pi
, a standard
si
and a beauty
bi
. Each person
j
has an income of
incj
and a preferred beauty
prefj
.
A person would never buy a dish whose standard is less than the person's income. Also, a person can't afford a dish with a price greater than the income of the person. In other words, a person
j
can buy a dish
i
only if
pi≤incj≤si
.
Also, a person
j
can buy a dish
i
, only if
|bi−prefj|≤(incj−pi)
. In other words, if the price of the dish is less than the person's income by
k
, the person will only allow the absolute difference of at most
k
between the beauty of the dish and his/her preferred beauty.
Print the number of dishes that can be bought by each person in the city.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤105
,
1≤m≤105
), the number of dishes available in the city and the number of people living in the city.
The second line contains
n
integers
pi
(
1≤pi≤109
), the price of each dish.
The third line contains
n
integers
si
(
1≤si≤109
), the standard of each dish.
The fourth line contains
n
integers
bi
(
1≤bi≤109
), the beauty of each dish.
The fifth line contains
m
integers
incj
(
1≤incj≤109
), the income of every person.
The sixth line contains
m
integers
prefj
(
1≤prefj≤109
), the preferred beauty of every person.
It is guaranteed that for all integers
i
from
1
to
n
, the following condition holds:
pi≤si
.
Output
Print
m
integers, the number of dishes that can be bought by every person living in the city.
