For given integers
n
and
m
, let's call a pair of arrays
a
and
b
of integers good, if they satisfy the following conditions:
a
and
b
have the same length, let their length be
k
.
k≥2
and
a1=0,ak=n,b1=0,bk=m
.
For each
1<i≤k
the following holds:
ai≥ai−1
,
bi≥bi−1
, and
ai+bi≠ai−1+bi−1
.
Find the sum of
|a|
over all good pairs of arrays
(a,b)
. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo
109+7
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t(1≤t≤104)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(1≤n,m≤5⋅106)
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅106
and the sum of
m
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅106
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer  — the sum of
|a|
over all good pairs of arrays
(a,b)
modulo
109+7
.

Note
In the first testcase, the good pairs of arrays are
([0,1],[0,1])
, length =
2
.
([0,1,1],[0,0,1])
, length =
3
.
([0,0,1],[0,1,1])
, length =
3
.
Hence the sum of the lengths would be
2+3+3=8
.
