Explanation:
Test case
1:
Chef will buy
16 Fuljhari's and
4 Anar's which in total costs him
16⋅5+4⋅5=100 rupees.
Next, he uses
16 Fuljhari's to light
4
16
=4 Anar's.
Since all the Fuljhari's are over, he can't light up any Chakri's.
So in total, he is able to light up
4+0=4 Anar's and Chakri's.
There is no other allocation giving a better answer than this.
Test case
2:
Chef will buy
4 Fuljhari's,
2 Anar's and
2 Chakri's which in total costs him
4⋅2+2⋅2+2⋅2=16 rupees.
Next, he uses
2 Fuljhari's to light
1
2
=2 Anar's.
Next, he uses
2 Fuljhari's to light
1
2
=2 Chakri's.
So in total, he is able to light up
2+2=4 Anar's and Chakri's.
The other possible allocation could be buying
4 Fuljhari's,
3 Anar's, and
1 Chakri.
