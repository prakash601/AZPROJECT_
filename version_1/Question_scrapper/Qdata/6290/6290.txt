Nadaca is a country with
N cities. These cities are numbered
1 through
N and connected by
M bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city
1. At each of the following
K seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has
Q conditions
(a

,b
1
),(a

,b

),…,(a
Q
,b
Q
) meaning that during this
K-second trip, for each valid
i, he wants to be in city
a
i
after exactly
b
i
seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo
10
9
+7. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after
1,2,…,K seconds.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
K.
Each of the next
M lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting a road between cities
u and
v.
The next line contains a single integer
Q.
Q lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤Q), the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
a
i
and
b
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo
10
9
+7.
