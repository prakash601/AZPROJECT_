You are given a positive integer
K and an array
A consisting of
N non-negative integers. Find the lexicographically smallest sequence
B that satisfies the following conditions
We can obtain
B by rearranging the elements in
A.
The length of longest non-decreasing subsequence of
B is equal to
K.
If no such sequence exists, print
−1.
Input Format
First line of the input contains
T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers
N and
K.
Second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers describing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the array
B in a single line with a space between two consecutive elements. And output
−1 if no such array
B exists.

Explanation:
There are
6 arrays that are rearrangements of the array
[2,1,3].
[1,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
3.
[1,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2.
[2,1,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2.
[2,3,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2.
[3,1,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2.
[3,2,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
1.
Test case 1:
Observe from the list above that
[3,2,1] is the only rearrangement of
[2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
1. And hence
[3,2,1] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case 2:
Observe from the above list the
[1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest among all those rearrangements with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2. And hence
[1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case 3:
Observe from the list above that
[1,2,3] is the only rearrangement of
[2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
3. And hence
[1,2,3] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.
Test case 4:
There are only
3 possible ways to rearrange
[2,2,3].
[2,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
3.
[2,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2.
[3,2,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
2.
So there does not exist any rearrangement of
[2,2,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to
1.
