Chef and Paja are bored, so they are playing an infinite game of ping pong. The rules of the game are as follows:
The players play an infinite number of games. At the end of each game, the player who won it scores a point.
In each game, one of the players serves. Chef serves in the first game.
After every
K points are scored (regardless of which players scored them), i.e. whenever
K games have been played since the last time the serving player changed, the player that serves in the subsequent games changes: if Chef served in the game that just finished, then Paja will serve in the next game and all subsequent games until the serving player changes again; if Paja served, then Chef will serve.
The players got a little too caught up in the game and they forgot who is supposed to serve in the next game. Will you help them determine that? So far, Chef has scored
X points and Paja has scored
Y points.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
X,
Y and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef is supposed to serve next or "Paja" otherwise (without quotes).
