Chef went to the store in order to buy one can of coke. In the store, they offer
N cans of coke (numbered
1 through
N). For each valid
i, the current temperature of the
i-th can is
C
i
and its price is
P
i
.
After buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef
M minutes to get home from the store.
The ambient temperature outside is
K. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is
t at some point in time:
if
t>K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be
t−1
if
t<K−1, then one minute later, its temperature will be
t+1
if
K−1≤t≤K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be
K
When Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between
L and
R (inclusive). Find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied or determine that there is no such can.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers
N,
M,
K,
L and
R.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
C
i
and
P
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the price of the can Chef should buy, or
−1 if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Chef should buy the second can (with price
8), even though the first can is cheaper. If Chef bought the first can, its temperature would be
3 when he got home, and that is outside the range
[4,6].
Example case 2: No matter which can Chef buys, when he gets home, its temperature will be less than
20, so there is no suitable can available in the store.
