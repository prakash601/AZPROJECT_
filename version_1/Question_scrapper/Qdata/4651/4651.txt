Given a string
S of length
N containing only numeric characters, find the number of Nice Pairs.
A Nice Pair is a pair of indices -
(i,j) such that
1≤i<j≤N and
j−i=∣S
j
−S
i
∣.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer,
N, the length of the string
The second line of each testcase contains a string
S of length
N. The string contains only numeric characters
[0−9]
For each testcase, output a single integer - the number of nice pairs in the given string.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤10

String
S contains only numeric characters
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10
