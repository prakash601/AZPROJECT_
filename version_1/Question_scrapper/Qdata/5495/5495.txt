"I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact." - Sheldon.
After years of hard work, Sheldon was finally able to develop a formula which would diminish the real human contact.
He found
k integers
n
1
,n
2
...n
k
. Also he found that if he could minimize the value of
m such that
∑
i=1
k
n
i
C
m
i is even, where
m = \sum_{i=1}^k$$m_i, he would finish the real human contact.
Since Sheldon is busy choosing between PS-4 and XBOX-ONE, he want you to help him to calculate the minimum value of
m.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
k.
Next line contains k space separated integers
n

2
...n
k
.
###Output:
For each test case output the minimum value of m for which
∑
i=1
k
n

C
m
i is even, where
m=
