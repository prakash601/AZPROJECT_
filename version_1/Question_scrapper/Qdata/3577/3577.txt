Explanation:
Test case
1: The car runs for
800 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
800⋅10=8000 rupees.
Test case
2: The car runs for
3 kms. However, since Chef booked the car for whole day, he needs to pay for at least
300 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
300⋅10=3000 rupees.
Test case
3: The car runs for
299 kms. However, since Chef booked the car for whole day, he needs to pay for at least
300 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
300⋅10=3000 rupees.
Test case
4: The car runs for
301 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
301⋅10=3010 rupees.
Test case
5: The car runs for
300 kms. Thus, he needs to pay
300⋅10=3000 rupees.
