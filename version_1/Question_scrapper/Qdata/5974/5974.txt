You have an
n×n matrix
a. You can rearrange the elements of the matrix in any way. Let
m
1
,m
2
,…,m
n
be the medians of each row in
a after the rearrangement. The goodness of the matrix
a is defined as the minimum median among the medians of all rows i.e
min(m
1
,m
2
,…,m
n
). Naturally, rearranging values also comes with a cost. The cost of rearrangement is defined as
m
1
+m
2
+⋯+m
n
.
Find the maximum goodness you can achieve after rearranging a matrix
a such that the cost of rearrangement doesn't exceed
k or
−1 if the answer doesn't exist.
The median of an array
a consisting of
n elements is the
⌈
2
n+1
⌉
th
smallest element of
a. The median of
[4,8,6,1] is
6 and the median of
[1,6,2,4,5] is
4.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t denoting the number of test cases. The description of
t test cases follows.
The first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers
n and
k.
n lines follow, each consisting of
n space-separated integers denoting the matrix
a
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum goodness you can achieve such that the rearrangement cost does not exceed
k or -1 if the answer doesn't exist.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We rearrange the matrix as follows:
[
⎣
⎡
11
17
5
32
2
3
15
9
1
13
6
8
16
3
24
9
⎦
⎤
. The medians of each row are
11,13,15,9 respectively. The goodness is
9 and the cost is
48. There are other rearrangements that may yield the same goodness but
9 is the maximum goodness we can get.
Test case
2: The rearranged matrix is:
[
⎣
⎡
17

32
24

⎦
⎤
. The medians of each row are
8,6,15,9 respectively. The goodness is
6 and the cost is
38. There are other rearrangements that may yield the same goodness but
6 is the maximum goodness we can get.
Test case
3: No matter how we rearrange the elements, the cost is always greater than
k.
