Construct an
N×M matrix with entries having positive integers such that:
If
M>1,
i
th
row is strictly increasing from left to right with a fixed common difference
d
i
for all
1≤i≤N.
If
N>1,
j
th
column is strictly increasing from top to bottom with a fixed common difference
c
j
for all
1≤j≤M.
All the common differences should be distinct.
In the case of multiple answers, find an arrangement that minimizes the maximum element of the matrix.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two space-separated integers
N and
M - the dimensions of the matrix.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N lines with each line having
M space-separated integers representing the answer.
