Given two arrays
A and
B of length
N each.
You can do the following operation on the array
B exactly once:
Chose two integers
R
(1≤R≤N) and
K(K≥0) and apply
K right-rotations to the subarray
[1,R].
Applying a right-rotation to the array
C=[C

Find whether you can transform the array
B into the array
A by applying the mentioned operation exactly once. If it is possible, find the minimum value of
K for which it is possible.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains the integer
N - the size of arrays
A and
B.
The second line contains
N integers

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum possible value of
K. If it is not possible to convert
B to
A, print -1.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Let
R=3 and
K=1. Thus, we apply
1 right-rotation on the subarray
[4,5,1]. The rotated subarray is
[1,4,5]. The updated array is
[1,4,5,2] which is equal to the array
A.
It can be shown that the array
B cannot be converted into the array
A using
K less than
1.
Test case
2: The array
B cannot be converted to the array
A using the mentioned operation exactly once.
