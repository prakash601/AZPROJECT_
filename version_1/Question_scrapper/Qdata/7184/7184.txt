You are given an array
A consisting of
N positive integers.
In one operation, you can replace an element
A
i
(1≤i≤N) with any positive integer
X
(1≤X≤10
9
).
For each
1≤i≤N, find the minimum number of operations required to make the number of modes in the array exactly equal to
i.
If it is not possible to do so for any
i, print
−1 corresponding to that
i.
Note that modes of the array are elements with the maximum frequency. For example, the array
[1,1,2,2,3,4] has
2 modes, which are
1 and
2.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1

N
denoting the elements of the array.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N spaced integers, where the
i
th
integer denotes the minimum operations required to make the number of modes in the array exactly equal to
i.
If it is not possible to do so for any
i, print
−1 corresponding to that
i.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Initially, the array
[1,2,3,1,2] has two modes
(1 and
2).
i=1: Changing the value at index
1 to
5 gives an array
[5,2,3,1,2]. There is only
1 mode in this array, that is
2.
i=2: The original array has
2 modes, thus we require
0 operations to have
2 modes in the array.
i=3: We cannot have
3 modes in the array using any number of operations.
i=4: We cannot have
4 modes in the array using any number of operations.
i=5: Changing the values at indices
1 and
2 to
5 and
6 respectively gives the array
[5,6,3,1,2]. This array has five modes as frequency of all elements is same.
Test case
2: Initially, the array
[2,6,6,4,2,1] has two modes
(6 and
2).
i=1: Changing the value at index
2 to
7 gives an array
[2,7,6,4,2,1]. There is only
1 mode in this array, that is
2.
i=2: The original array has
2 modes, thus we require
0 operations to have
2 modes in the array.
i=3: Changing the value at index
6 to
4 gives an array
[2,6,6,4,2,4]. There are
3 modes in this array.
i=4: We cannot have
4 modes in the array using any number of operations.
i=5: We cannot have
5 modes in the array using any number of operations.
i=6: Changing the values at indices
1 and
2 to
7 and
8 respectively gives the array
[7,8,6,4,2,1]. This array has six modes as frequency of all elements is same.
