Given a palindromic number N in the form of string. The task is to find the smallest palindromic number greater than N using the same set of digits as in N.
Example 1:
Input: 
N = "35453"
Output: 
53435
Explanation: Next higher palindromic 
number is 53435.
Example 2:
Input: N = "33"
Output: -1
Explanation: Next higher palindromic number 
does not exist.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function nextPalin() which takes the string N as input parameters and returns the answer, else if no such number exists returns "-1".
Expected Time Complexity: O(|N|log|N|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 ≤ |N| ≤ 105
