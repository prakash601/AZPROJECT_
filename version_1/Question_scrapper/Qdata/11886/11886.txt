Let's call some positive integer classy if its decimal representation contains no more than
3
non-zero digits. For example, numbers
4
,
200000
,
10203
are classy and numbers
4231
,
102306
,
7277420000
are not.
You are given a segment
[L;R]
. Count the number of classy integers
x
such that
L≤x≤R
.
Each testcase contains several segments, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤104
) — the number of segments in a testcase.
Each of the next
T
lines contains two integers
Li
and
Ri
(
1≤Li≤Ri≤1018
).
Output
Print
T
lines — the
i
-th line should contain the number of classy integers on a segment
[Li;Ri]
.
