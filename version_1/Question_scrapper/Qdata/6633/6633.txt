For an integer
K and a permutation
A=[A

,…,A
N
] of values from
1 to
N, we define a function
f(A) that returns the number of pairs of integers
(i,j) such that
1≤i<j≤N
j>i+K

[1..j]
,
A
i
is the second-largest element and
A
j
is the largest element.
You are given
K. Calculate
∑f(A) for ALL permutations
A of size
N.
Since the answer can be very large, find the sum over modulo
.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the sum of
f(P) for all permutation of size
N for the given
K.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
f(A)=0 for permutations {
1,2,3}, {
1,3,2}, {
2,3,1}, {
3,1,2}, {
3,2,1} .
f(A)=1 for permutation {
2,1,3}.
Therefore
∑f(P)=1.
Test case
2:
f(A)=1 for permutations {
3,1,2,4} and {
3,2,1,4}.
f(A)=0 for all other permutations.
Therefore
∑f(A)=2.
