Chef has met up with his old friend Jack recently. Jack told Chef that he found a recipe for an ancient dish, but unfortunately, it is locked in a safe and to open the safe, it is necessary to enter the solution to the following problem.
There is a sequence of non-negative integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
on the safe. Find the number of pairs
(l,r) (
1≤l≤r≤N) which satisfy the condition
(A
l
∨A
l+1
∨…∨A
r
)⊕(A
l
∧A
l+1
∧…∧A
r
)≥max(A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
).
Here,
⊕ denotes bitwise XOR,
∨ denotes bitwise OR and
∧ denotes bitwise AND.
Jack and Chef cannot think of anything except the recipe, so you are asked to open the safe.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of pairs
(l,r) that satisfy the given condition.
