Let's define a function
P(A) for a sequence
A as the number of ways to divide
A into contiguous subsequences such that each element of
A belongs to exactly one of these subsequences and the sum of elements of each subsequence is between
L and
R inclusive.
For each integer
n between
1 and
N inclusive, solve the following problem: Consider a random sequence
A with length
n where each element is an integer between
1 and
K chosen uniformly randomly and independently. Find the expected value of
P(A).
For each valid
n, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction
P/Q, where
P and
Q are positive integers and
Q is coprime with
998,244,353. You should compute
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353, where
Q
−1
is the multiplicative inverse of
Q modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
N,
K,
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these integers should be
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353 for
n=i.

Explanation:
Example case 1: For
n=1, we have
P([1])=P([2])=1 and
P(A)=0 for any other sequence. Hence, the expected value is
2/2=1.
For
n=2, there are four valid sequences
[1,1],
[1,2],
[2,1] and
[2,2]. Each of them can be split into one-element subsequences. In addition,
[1,1] can be left unchanged (split into only one subsequence), so
P([1,1])=2. The expected value is
(2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266.
