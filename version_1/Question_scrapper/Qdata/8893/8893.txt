Petya is a math teacher.
n
of his students has written a test consisting of
m
questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.
If the student answers the
j
-th question correctly, he gets
pj
points (otherwise, he gets
0
points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array
p
is a permutation of numbers from
1
to
m
.
For the
i
-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get
xi
points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to
n
∑
i=1
|xi−ri|
, where
ri
is the number of points that the
i
-th student has got for the test.
Your task is to help Petya find such a permutation
p
for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤10
;
1≤m≤104
) — the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
x1,x2,…,xn
(
0≤xi≤
m(m+1)
2
), where
xi
is the number of points that the
i
-th student expects to get.
This is followed by
n
lines, the
i
-th line contains the string
si
(
|si|=m;si,j∈{0,1}
), where
si,j
is
1
if the
i
-th student has answered the
j
-th question correctly, and
0
otherwise.
The sum of
m
for all test cases does not exceed
104
.
Output
For each test case, print
m
integers — a permutation
p
for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
