In a recent breakthrough in mathematics, the proof utilized a concept called Height.
Consider a fraction
b
a
. Its Height is defined as the maximum of its numerator and denominator. So, for example, the Height of
19
3
would be
19, and the Height of
4
27
would be
27.
Given
a and
b, find the Height of
b
a
.
Input Format
The only line of input contains two integers,
a and
b.
Output Format
Output a single integer, which is the Height of
b
a
.
Constraints
1≤a,b≤100
a and
b do not have any common factors.
Sample 1:
Input
Output
3 19
19
Explanation:
The maximum of
{3,19} is
19. Hence the Height of
19
3
is
19.
Sample 2:
Input
Output
27 4
27
Explanation:
The maximum of
{27,4} is
27. Hence the Height of
4
27
is
27.
