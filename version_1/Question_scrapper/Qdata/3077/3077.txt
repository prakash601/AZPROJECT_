Given an array A[ ] of N of  integers, find the distinct index of values that satisfy A + B = C + D where A,B,C & D are integers values in the array.
Note: As there may be multiple pairs satisfying the equation return lexicographically smallest order of  A, B, C and D and return all as -1 if there are no pairs satisfying the equation.
  Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
A[] = {3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8}
Output:
0 2 3 5
Explanation:
A[0] + A[2] = 3+7 = 10
A[3] + A[5] = 1+9 = 10
Input:
N = 4
A[] = {424, 12, 31, 7}
Output:
-1 -1 -1 -1
Explanation:
There are no pairs satisfying the equation.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function satisfyEqn() which takes an Integer N and an array A[] of size N as input and returns a vector of 4 integers denoting A, B, C, and D respectively.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N2*logN2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)
  Constraints:
1 <= N <= 500
1 <= A[i] <= 105
