N×N matrix
B, where
B

for each valid
i and
j.
You need to find the number of square submatrices of
B such that the sum of their elements is
X. Formally, find the number of quartets
(x

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of square submatrices with sum
X.
