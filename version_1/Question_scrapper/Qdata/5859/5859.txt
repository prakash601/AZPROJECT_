Chef recently took a course in linear algebra and learned about linear combinations of vectors. Therefore, in order to test his intelligence, Raj gave him a "fuzzy" problem to solve.
A sequence of integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
generates an integer
K if it is possible to find a sequence of integers
C
1
,C
2
,…,C
M
such that
C
1
⋅B
1
+C
2
⋅B
2
+…+C
M
⋅B
M
=K.
In this problem, Chef has a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and he should answer
Q queries. In each query, he is given an integer
K; the answer to this query is the number of pairs
(l,r) such that
1≤l≤r≤N and the subsequence
(A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
) generates
K.
Chef has no idea how to solve this problem ― can you help him find the answers to all queries?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
The third line contains a single integer
Q.
The following
Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer
K.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of contiguous subsequences that generate
K.

Explanation:
The sequence
(2,4) has three contiguous subsequences:
(2),
(4) and
(2,4).
In the first query,
1 cannot be generated by any subsequence.
In the second query,
2 is generated by subsequences
(2) and
(2,4). For example, for the subsequence
(2,4), we can choose
C
1
=1 and
C
2
=0.
In the third query,
8 is generated by all three subsequences.
