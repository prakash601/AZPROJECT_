Given a non-empty sequence of characters str, return true if sequence is Binary, else return false
Example 1:
Input:
str = 101
Output:
1
Explanation:
Since string contains only 0 and 1, output is 1.
Example 2:
Input:
str = 75
Output:
0
Explanation:
Since string contains digits other than 0 and 1, output is 0.
  Your Task:
Complete the function isBinary() which takes an string str as input parameter and returns 1 if str is binary and returns 0 otherwise.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <=T<= 50
1 <=Length of str<= 10000
