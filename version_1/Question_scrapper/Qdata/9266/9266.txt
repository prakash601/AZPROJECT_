You are given a sequence of
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
.
Does there exist a sequence of
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
such that the following property holds?
For each
1≤i≤n
, there exist two (not necessarily distinct) indices
j
and
k
(
1≤j,k≤n
) such that
ai=bj−bk
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤20
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤10
).
The second line of each test case contains the
n
integers
a1,…,an
(
−105≤ai≤105
).
Output
For each test case, output a line containing YES if a sequence
b1,…,bn
satisfying the required property exists, and NO otherwise.

Note
In the first test case, the sequence
b=[−9,2,1,3,−2]
satisfies the property. Indeed, the following holds:
a1=4=2−(−2)=b2−b5
;
a2=−7=−9−(−2)=b1−b5
;
a3=−1=1−2=b3−b2
;
a4=5=3−(−2)=b4−b5
;
a5=10=1−(−9)=b3−b1
.
In the second test case, it is sufficient to choose
b=[0]
, since
a1=0=0−0=b1−b1
.
In the third test case, it is possible to show that no sequence
b
of length
3
satisfies the property.
