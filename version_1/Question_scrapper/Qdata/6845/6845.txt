Chef is again playing with numbers.
He defines the rating of a number as the count of trailing zeros in the product of all the digits of the number.
Chef wants you to find the sum of ratings of all the numbers between the numbers
A and
B (excluding
A). As the answer can be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Note: If the product of the digits of a number is
0, the number's rating is defined to be
1.
Input Format
The first line contains
2 space-separated integers,
A and
B.
Output Format
Output a single integer, the sum of ratings of all the numbers between the numbers
A and
B (excluding
A). As the answer can be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Constraints
1≤A<B≤10
1000
Sample 1:
Input
Output
1 10
1
Explanation:
10 will have rating
1 as its product of digits =
1⋅0 =
0 has
1 trailing zero. All other numbers have a single digit and thus, no trailing zeroes.
Sample 2:
Input
Output
10 30
3
Explanation:
Chef will rate
20,25, and
30 as
1 as the product of their digits have
1 trailing zeros. All other numbers have no trailing zeroes.
Sample 3:
Input
Output
454 455
2
Explanation:
The product of digits of
455 is
4⋅5⋅5=100, which has
2 trailing zeroes. Thus, the rating is
2.
