Today at the lesson of mathematics, Petya learns about the digital root.
The digital root of a non-negative integer is the single digit value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.
Let's denote the digital root of
x
as
S(x)
. Then
S(5)=5
,
S(38)=S(3+8=11)=S(1+1=2)=2
,
S(10)=S(1+0=1)=1
.
As a homework Petya got
n
tasks of the form: find
k
-th positive number whose digital root is
x
.
Petya has already solved all the problems, but he doesn't know if it's right. Your task is to solve all
n
tasks from Petya's homework.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤103
) — the number of tasks in Petya's homework. The next
n
lines contain two integers
ki
(
1≤ki≤1012
) and
xi
(
1≤xi≤9
) —
i
-th Petya's task in which you need to find a
ki
-th positive number, the digital root of which is
xi
.
Output
Output
n
lines,
i
-th line should contain a single integer — the answer to the
i
-th problem.
