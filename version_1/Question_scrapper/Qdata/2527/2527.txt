Given  a grid of n*m consisting of O's and X's. The task is to find the number of 'X' total shapes.
Note: 'X' shape consists of one or more adjacent X's (diagonals not included).
  Example 1:
Input: grid = {{X,O,X},{O,X,O},{X,X,X}}
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The grid is-
X O X
O X O
X X X
So, X with same colour are adjacent to each 
other vertically for horizontally (diagonals 
not included). So, there are 3 different groups 
in the given grid.
Example 2:
Input: grid = {{X,X},{X,X}}
Output: 1
Expanation: 
The grid is- 
X X
X X
So, X with same colour are adjacent to each
other vertically for horizontally (diagonals
not included). So, there is only 1 group
in the given grid.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function xShape() which takes grid as input parameter and returns the count of total X shapes.
  Expected Time Compelxity: O(n*m)
Expected Space Compelxity: O(n*m)
  Constraints:
