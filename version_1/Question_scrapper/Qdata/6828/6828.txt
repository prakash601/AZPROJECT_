You are given a tree
T with
N vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph with
N−1 edges.
Determine the minimum number of edges you must add to
T to get a new graph
G such that
G has a Hamiltonian path.
Note: A graph
G is said to have a hamiltonian path if and only if there exists a simple path in
G that includes every vertex exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
— the number of vertices of the tree.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges. The
i-th of these
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of edges to add to the tree
T to get a graph with a hamiltonian path.

Explanation:
For the first test case, the tree is as shown below. We only need to add one edge between
(4,5) to get a hamiltonian path. The path will be
2→1→3→4→5. We could have also added the edge
(2,4) instead to get a different hamiltonian path.
For the second test case, the given tree itself has a hamiltonian path. So there is no need of adding any edges.
