There is an empty bus with
M seats and a total of
N people, numbered from
1 to
N. Everyone is currently outside the bus. You are given a sequence of
Q events of the following form.
+ i : It denotes that the person
i enters the bus.
− i : It denotes that the person
i leaves the bus.
It is guaranteed in the input that each person from
1 to
N enters at most once as well as leaves the bus at most once.
Determine whether the sequence of events is consistent or not (i.e. no person leaves the bus before entering and the number of passengers in the bus does not exceed
M at any point of time).
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains
Q+1 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,M,Q.
Q lines follow. For each valid
j,
j
th
of these lines contains a character
ch, followed by a space and an integer
i. Here
ch is either '
+' or '
−' and
1≤i≤N.
It is guaranteed that
‘‘+
i" and
‘‘−
i" appears at most once for every
1≤i≤N
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one string - "Consistent" (without quotes) if the sequence is consistent, "Inconsistent" (without quotes) otherwise.
