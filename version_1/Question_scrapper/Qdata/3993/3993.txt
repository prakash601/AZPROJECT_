Chef has an array
A of length
N.
In one operation, Chef can remove any one element from the array.
Determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements same.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N —the length of Array
A.
Next line contains
space-separated integers
,
,
,…,
N
- denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements same.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All the elements are already same. Thus we need to perform zero operations.
Test case
2: We remove the elements
A
1
,A
2
, and
A
4
using three operations. The array becomes
[2,2,2] where all elements are same.
Test case
3: We remove the elements
A
1
and
A
3
using two operations. The array becomes
[2,2] where all elements are same.
Test case
4: We remove the elements
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
, and
A
4
using four operations. The array becomes
[5].
