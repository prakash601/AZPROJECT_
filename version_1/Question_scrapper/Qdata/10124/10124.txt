You are given a tree (connected graph without cycles) consisting of
n
vertices. The tree is unrooted — it is just a connected undirected graph without cycles.
In one move, you can choose exactly
k
leaves (leaf is such a vertex that is connected to only one another vertex) connected to the same vertex and remove them with edges incident to them. I.e. you choose such leaves
u1,u2,…,uk
that there are edges
(u1,v)
,
(u2,v)
,
…
,
(uk,v)
and remove these leaves and these edges.
Your task is to find the maximum number of moves you can perform if you remove leaves optimally.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅104
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
;
1≤k<n
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of leaves you remove in one move, respectively. The next
n−1
lines describe edges. The
i
-th edge is represented as two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤n
), where
xi
and
yi
are vertices the
i
-th edge connects. It is guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅105
(
∑n≤2⋅105
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer — the maximum number of moves you can perform if you remove leaves optimally.
