You are given an array
A of
N integers and an integer
K. Find the number of (possibly empty) subsequences of
A such that no two elements in the subsequence have a sum that is divisible by
K.
Two subsequences are considered distinct if they are made up of different indices. For example,
A=[1,2,1,2] contains
[1,2] as a subsequence three times, and all
3 must be counted separately in the answer.
More formally,
Let
S={x
1
,x
2
,…,x
m
} be a (possibly empty) set such that
1≤x
1
<x
2
<…<x
m
≤N.
S is said to be good if
A
x
i
+A
x
j
is not divisible by
K for any
1≤i<j≤m. In particular, any subsequence of size
≤1 is good.
Your task is to count the number of sets.
Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo
10

+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers,
N and
K.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: Here,
K=4. There are
8 subsequences of the array, and they are considered as follows:
[]: the empty subsequence. It satisfies the condition.
[4],[5],[7]: size
1 subsequences, all are good.
[4,5]: good, because
4+5=9 is not a multiple of
4
[4,7]: good, because
4+7=11 is not a multiple of
4
[5,7]: not good, because
5+7=12 is a multiple of
4.
[4,5,7]: not good, again because it contains
5 and
7.
So,
6 of the subsequences are good.
