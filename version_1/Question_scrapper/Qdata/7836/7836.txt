You are given a tree (a connected graph without cycles) with
𝑛
vertices.
Consider a fixed integer
𝑘
. Then, the graph
𝐺
𝑘
is an undirected graph with
𝑛
vertices, where an edge between vertices
𝑢
and
𝑣
exists if and only if the distance between vertices
𝑢
and
𝑣
in the given tree is at least
𝑘
.
For each
𝑘
from
1
to
𝑛
, print the number of connected components in the graph
𝐺
𝑘
.
Input
The first line contains the integer
𝑛
(
2≤𝑛≤
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.
Each of the next
𝑛−1
lines contains two integers
𝑢
and
𝑣
(
1≤𝑢,𝑣≤𝑛
), denoting an edge between vertices
𝑢
and
𝑣
in the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a valid tree.
Output
Output
𝑛
integers: the number of connected components in the graph
𝐺
𝑘
for each
𝑘
from
1
to
𝑛
.

Note
In the first example: If
𝑘=1
, the graph has an edge between each pair of vertices, so it has one component. If
𝑘=4
, the graph has only edges
4↔6
and
5↔6
, so the graph has
4
components.
In the second example: when
𝑘=1
or
𝑘=2
the graph has one component. When
𝑘=3
the graph
𝐺
𝑘
splits into
3
components: one component has vertices
1
,
4
and
5
, and two more components contain one vertex each. When
𝑘=4
or
𝑘=5
each vertex is a separate component.
