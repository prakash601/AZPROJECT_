There are
N shops in the town, numbered from
1 to
N. The
i-th shop has an infinite amount of items with value
V
i
each. And each item in each shop costs exactly
1 dollar.
To prevent you from spending all your money buying just the items of maximum value, you have to follow some rules:
Let
num
i
be the number of items you bought at the
i-th store.
num
1
can only be either
0 or
1.
num
i
≤num
i−1
+1 for
2≤i≤N.
Find the maximum sum of value you can obtain if you can spend a total of
K dollars.
Input Format
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the number of shops and the money you have.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
V

- the value of the items in the

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer - the maximum sum of value you can achive.

Explanation:
The optimal choice is to buy
1 item in the first shop,
2 in the second,
1 in the third,
0 in the fourth, and
1 in the fifth.
The sum of values are
(1×3)+(2×5)+(1×4)+(0×2)+(1×6)=23.
