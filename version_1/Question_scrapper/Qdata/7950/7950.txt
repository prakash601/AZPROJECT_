There are
n
points
1,2,…,n
, each point
i
has a number
ai
on it. You're playing a game on them. Initially, you are at point
1
. When you are at point
i
, take following steps:
If
1≤i≤n
, go to
i+ai
,
Otherwise, the game ends.
Before the game begins, you can choose two integers
x
and
y
satisfying
1≤x≤n
,
−n≤y≤n
and replace
ax
with
y
(set
ax:=y
). Find the number of distinct pairs
(x,y)
such that the game that you start after making the change ends in a finite number of steps.
Notice that you do not have to satisfy
ax≠y
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104)
— the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of points.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−n≤ai≤n
) — the numbers on the axis.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the number of distinct pairs
(x,y)
with which the game ends.

Note
In the first test case, the pairs
(x,y)
with which the game ends are
(1,−1)
and
(1,1)
, corresponding to the routes
1→0
and
1→2
. Note that
(1,2)
is invalid since when
n=1
,
y=2
violates
−n≤y≤n
.
(1,0)
is also invalid since you will go from
1
to
1
forever.
In the second test case, the pairs are
(1,−2),(1,−1),(1,2),(2,−2),(2,−1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
.
In the fourth test case, the pairs are
(1,−2),(1,−1),(1,1),(1,2),(2,−2),(2,1),(2,2)
.
