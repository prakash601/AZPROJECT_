You are given a grid with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
M columns (numbered
1 through
M). Each cell of this grid contains either water or land. The initial state of the grid is described by strings
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
N
; for each valid
i and
j, the
j-th character of
S
i
is '.' if the cell in the
i-th row and
j-th column initially contains water or '*' if this cell initially contains land.
A maximal group of connected land cells (by moving between side-adjacent land cells) is called an island.
You may perform any number of operations (including zero). In one operation, you should choose one cell of the grid and convert it either to a land cell or to a water cell. Find the smallest number of operations required to maximise the number of islands in the grid.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains a single string
S
i
with length
M.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations required to maximise the number of islands.
Constraints
