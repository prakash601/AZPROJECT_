Given a subset of digits S and a number N, find the smallest positive number which contains only the digits from S and is a multiple of N or -1 if solution does not exists.
###Input:
First line contains integer
t, denoting the number of test cases
First line of each test case contains two integers,
m,N, denoting size of set S and the number whose multiple you have to find.
Next Line of the test case consists of
m distinct space-separated integers denoting the digits in set
S.
###Output:
For each test case, output single line with answer to the test case.
###Constraints
1≤T≤30
1≤∣S∣≤10
1≤N≤10

###Sample Input: 2 3 123 2 4 6 3 101 0 3 2
###Sample Output: 246 202
###Explanation: For first case, 246 is the smallest positive multiple of 123 that has only digits from set {2,4,6}
