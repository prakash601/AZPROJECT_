Given a string S consisting of opening and closing parenthesis '(' and ')'. Find length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.
A parenthesis string is valid if:
For every opening parenthesis, there is a closing parenthesis.
Opening parenthesis must be closed in the correct order.
Example 1:
Input: S = ((()
Output: 2
Explaination: The longest valid 
parenthesis substring is "()".
Example 2:
Input: S = )()())
 4
 The longest valid 
parenthesis substring is "()()".
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxLength() which takes string S as input parameter and returns the length of the maximum valid parenthesis substring.
Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)
Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
