Chef has a binary string
S of length
N. Chef can perform the following operation on
S:
Insert any character (
0 or
1) at any position in
S.
Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that no two consecutive characters are same in
S.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of the binary string
S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S of length
N containing
0s and
1s only.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that no two consecutive characters are same in
S.
Constraints
