We start with a permutation
a1,a2,…,an
and with an empty array
b
. We apply the following operation
k
times.
On the
i
-th iteration, we select an index
ti
(
1≤ti≤n−i+1
), remove
ati
from the array, and append one of the numbers
ati−1
or
ati+1
(if
ti−1
or
ti+1
are within the array bounds) to the right end of the array
b
. Then we move elements
ati+1,…,an
to the left in order to fill in the empty space.
You are given the initial permutation
a1,a2,…,an
and the resulting array
b1,b2,…,bk
. All elements of an array
b
are distinct. Calculate the number of possible sequences of indices
t1,t2,…,tk
modulo
998244353
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100000
), denoting the number of test cases, followed by a description of the test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n,k
(
1≤k<n≤200000
): sizes of arrays
a
and
b
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
): elements of
a
. All elements of
a
are distinct.
The third line of each test case contains
k
integers
b1,b2,…,bk
(
1≤bi≤n
): elements of
b
. All elements of
b
are distinct.
The sum of all
n
among all test cases is guaranteed to not exceed
200000
.
Output
For each test case print one integer: the number of possible sequences modulo
998244353
.

Note
Let's denote as
a1a2…ai
ai+1
_
…an→a1a2…ai−1ai+1…an−1
an operation over an element with index
i
: removal of element
ai
from array
a
and appending element
ai+1
to array
b
.
In the first example test, the following two options can be used to produce the given array
b
:
12
3
_
45→1
2
_
35→12
5
_
→12
;
(t1,t2,t3)=(4,3,2)
;
12
3
_
45→1
2
_
35→23
5
_
→15
;
(t1,t2,t3)=(4,1,2)
.
In the second example test, it is impossible to achieve the given array no matter the operations used. That's because, on the first application, we removed the element next to
4
, namely number
3
, which means that it couldn't be added to array
b
on the second step.
In the third example test, there are four options to achieve the given array
b
:
147

_
625→1436

_
5→1

_
325→432
