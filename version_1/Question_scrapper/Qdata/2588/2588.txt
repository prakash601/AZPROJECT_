Given two strings  S1 and S2 . You have to concatenate both the strings and print the concatenated string.
Example 1:
Input:
S1 = "Geeksfor"
S2 = "Geeks"
Output: GeeksforGeeks
Explanation: Combined "Geeksfor" and "Geeks"
  Example 2:
Input:
S1 = "Practice"
S2 = "Hard"
Output: PracticeHard
Combined "Practice" and "Hard"
  Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function conCat() which accepts two strings S1 and S2 as input parameter and returns concatenated string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S1| + |S2|) .
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S1| + |S2|) .
where N is the length of a String

Constraints:
1 <= |S1| , |S2| <= 105
|S| denotes the length of the string S.
