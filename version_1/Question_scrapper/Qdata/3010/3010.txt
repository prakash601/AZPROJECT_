Given a text and a pattern, the task is to check if the pattern exists in the text or not.
Example 1:
Input: text = "geeksforgeeks"
 pat = "geek"
Output: 1
Explanation: "geek" exists in
"geeksforgeeks"
Example 2:
Input: text = "geeksforgeeks"
pat = "gfg"
Output: 0
Explanation: "gfg" does not exists in
"geeksforgeeks"

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function search() which takes the string two strings as inputs and returns 1 if the pattern is found, otherwise 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|text| + |pat|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|text| + |pat|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |text|, |pat| ≤ 105
Both of the string contains lower case English alphabets
