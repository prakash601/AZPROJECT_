Chef has an integer sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. For each index
i (
1≤i≤N), Chef needs to divide
A
i
into two positive integers
x and
y (ie.
x,y>0) such that
x+y=A
i
, then place this as a point
(x,y) in the infinite
2-dimensional coordinate plane. Help Chef to find the maximum number of distinct points that can be put in the plane, if he optimally splits the values
A
i
. Note that Chef can only perform one split for each index.
Note: Please use fast input/output methods for this problem.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of distinct points there can be in the infinite plane.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef can divide
A
1
as
(1,1),
A
2
as
(1,1),
A
3
as
(1,3),
A
4
as
(2,2),
A
5
as
(1,1),
A
6
as
(2,4). Ignoring duplicates, there are
4 distinct points, which is the maximum possible.
Test Case 2: Chef can divide
A
1
as
(8,8),
