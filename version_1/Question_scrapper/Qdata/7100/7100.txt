We define the following for an operation:
The cost is defined as the product of all
K

. Formally, cost
=
∏

The score is defined as the product of all picked integers over all chosen intervals.
Formally, score

An operation is good if:
Maximum number of intervals are chosen.
In other words, the value of
M is the maximum possible.
The cost of the operation is not greater than
N;
Your task is to find the sum of scores of all possible good operations

Explanation:
Test case
1: You can only choose
M=1 indices. Otherwise, the cost will be greater than
N=3.
All the good operations are:
x
1
=1: For the chosen interval
[2,3], pick
K=2 distinct integers
{2,3} in it.
The cost is
2 and the score is
2⋅3=6.
x
1
=2: For the chosen interval
[1,2], pick
K=2 distinct integers
{1,2} in it.
The cost is
2 and the score is
1⋅2=2.
x
1
=3: For the chosen interval
[2,4], pick
K=2 distinct integers
{2,3} in it.
The cost is
2 and the score is
2⋅3=6.
x
1
=3: For the chosen interval
[2,4], pick
K=2 distinct integers
{2,4} in it.
The cost is
2 and the score is
2⋅4=8.
x
1
=3: For the chosen interval
[2,4], pick
K=2 distinct integers
{3,4} in it.
The cost is
2 and the score is
3⋅4=12.
x
1
=3: For the chosen interval
[2,4], pick
K=3 distinct integers
{2,3,4} in it.
The cost is
3 and the score is
2⋅3⋅4=24.
The sum of the scores of all possible good operations is
6+2+6+8+12+24=58.
