Chef has been recently introduced to bitwise operations.
Chefina defines a function
F(P,Q,R)=(R
∣
P)−(Q
&
P)
where
∣ represents the bitwise or and
& represents the bitwise and operator.
Chef has three non-negative integers
A,B, and
C.
Chef has to count the number of integers
X, such that:
0≤X<2
C
;
F(X,A,B) has the maximum possible value among all values of
X.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing three space-separated integers
A,B,C− as defined in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the count of
X such that
F(X,A,B) is maximum possible.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
4 possible values of
X which give maximum value for
F(X,A,B). These values are
4,5,6,7.
For all these values,
F(X,A,B) is
5.
Test case
2: The only possible value of
X which gives maximum value for
F(X,A,B) is
3.
For
X=3:
0≤X<2
2
F(3,0,0)=(0
∣
3)−(0
&
3)=3
It can be shown that
F(X,0,0) cannot have a value greater than
3 for
0≤X<2
