Alice has an integer sequence
a
of length
n
and all elements are different. She will choose a subsequence of
a
of length
m
, and defines the value of a subsequence
ab1,ab2,…,abm
as
m
∑
i=1
(m⋅abi)−
m
∑
i=1
m
∑
j=1
f(min(bi,bj),max(bi,bj)),
where
f(i,j)
denotes
min(ai,ai+1,…,aj)
.
Alice wants you to help her to maximize the value of the subsequence she choose.
A sequence
s
is a subsequence of a sequence
t
if
s
can be obtained from
t
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤m≤n≤4000
).
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai<231
).
Output
Print the maximal value Alice can get.

Note
In the first example, Alice can choose the subsequence
[15,2,18,13]
, which has the value
4⋅(15+2+18+13)−(15+2+2+2)−(2+2+2+2)−(2+2+18+12)−(2+2+12+13)=100
. In the second example, there are a variety of subsequences with value
176
, and one of them is
[9,7,12,20,18]
.
