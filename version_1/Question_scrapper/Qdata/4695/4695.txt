Chef has an array
A of size
N. He can perform the following operation on
A:
Select an
i
(1≤i≤N) and for all
1≤j≤i, set
A
j
:=A
j
+1 (i.e. add
1 to every element in the prefix of length
i).
Chef wants to convert
A to a palindrome by using the above operation minimum number of times. Can you help Chef?
If it is not possible to convert
A to a palindrome, output
−1.
Note: An array is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g.
[1,4,1] and
[7,3,3,7] are palindromic arrays.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to convert
A to a palindromic array.
If it is not possible to do so, output
−1.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The given array is already a palindrome.
Test case
2: It can be proven that it is not possible to convert
A to a palindromic array using the given operation.
Test case
3: We can perform the following operations:
Select
i=1,
[1,2,3,4]→[2,2,3,4]
Select
i=2,
[2,2,3,4]→[3,3,3,4]
Select
i=1,
[3,3,3,4]→[4,3,3,4]
