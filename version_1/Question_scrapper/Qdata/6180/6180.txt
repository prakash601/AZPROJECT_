You are given a sequence
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
of non-negative integers. Your task is to process
Q queries of the following format: each query is described by two integers
L≤R and asks to calculate the number of triples
(i,j,k), such that
L<i<j<k<R and
a
L
>a
i
<a
j
>a
k
<a
R
.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
N and
Q denoting the size of the sequence and the number of the queries to process.
The second line contains
N non-negative integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
.
Each of the next
Q lines contains two integers
L and
R describing the corresponding query.
Output
For each query, output a single line containing one integers: the number of triples as described above.

Explanation
The following triples
(i,j,k) are valid for the first and the second queries:
(3,5,7)
(3,5,8)
(3,6,7)
(3,6,8)
(4,5,7)
(4,5,8)
