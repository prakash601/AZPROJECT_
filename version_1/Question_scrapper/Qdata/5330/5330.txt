You are given an integer
N. Find the number of distinct XORs it is possible to make using two positive integers no larger than
N.
Formally, let
S be the set
S={x⊕y∣1≤x,y≤N}
where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Find
∣S∣ (where
∣S∣ denotes the size of set
S. Note that a set, by definition, has no repeated elements). The answer might be large, so output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, which contains one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer, modulo
10

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
N=1, so the only XOR we can possibly make is
1⊕1=0. Thus, the answer is
1.
Test Case 2:
N=3, which gives us
S={0,1,2,3} as the set of possible XORs. Thus, the answer is
∣S∣=4.
