Ghayeeth is a math teacher. He likes playing games, so he invented a new game which he wants to play against his student Siroj. The rules of the game are as follows:
Initially, Ghayeeth writes the numbers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
on a whiteboard and a number
Z=0 on a piece of paper.
Ghayeeth and Siroj alternate turns; Ghayeeth goes first.
In each turn, the current player must pick a number that is currently written on the whiteboard, add it to
Z and erase it from the whiteboard.
After each turn, if there is no pair of positive integers
(a,b) such that
Z=a
2
−b
2
, then the last player who made a move loses the game.
Otherwise, if there are no more numbers on the whiteboard, the last player who made a move wins the game.
Help Ghayeeth determine the winner of this game.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Ghayeeth" or "Siroj" (without quotes) — the name of the winner.
