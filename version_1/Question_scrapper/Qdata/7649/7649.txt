  Sereja has a matrix with size N*M, a cell with coordinate (i,j) contains the integer A[i][j]. Sereja wants to divide the matrix into two parts between him and Dima. Sereja wants to choose C rectangles, i-th rectangle has coordinates X1[i], Y1[i], X2[i], Y2[i] (1 <= X1[i] <= X2[i] <= N , 1 <= Y1[i] <= Y2[i] <= M , we assume that any cell with coordinate (x, y) fits condition X1[i] <= x <= X2[i] and Y1[i] <= y <= Y2[i] lies inside i-th rectangle). They need to be chosen in such a way that rectangles divide matrix in two equal parts. Lets Q[x] be number of number x from given matrix, that lies in at least one of the chosen rectangles, let W[x] be the opposite value - number of number x from the given matrix, that lies outside of each rectangle. Set of chosen rectangles divide matrix on two equal parts if and only if Q[x]=W[x] for all x.
  Help Sereja minimize number C. Also find C rectangles that divide matrix in two equal parts.
  Input
First line contains the number of test cases T. T tests follow. First line of each test case contains integers N, M. Each of the next N lines contains M integers. It is guaranteed that there is at least one required division.
  Output
First line of each test case should contain number C. Each of next C lines contains four numbers - coordinates of a rectangle. Sum of squares of all chosen rectangles shouldn't exceed N*M.
  Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100
1 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 1000
  Example
Input:
1
4 5
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
6 7 8 9 10
6 7 8 9 10
Output:
2
1 1 1 5
4 1 4 5
  Scoring
For each test case you will gain score Y as sum of all C in output. Lets yourscore is equal to sum of all Y. Score you will see on dashboard will be equal to bestscore/yourscore.
Tests generation
There will be five test cases. Each test case will contain 100 tests inside, in each test N = M = 100. Matrices are generated randomly and they are guaranteed to have at least one solution.
