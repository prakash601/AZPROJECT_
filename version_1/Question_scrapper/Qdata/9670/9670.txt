Nezzar loves the game osu!.
osu! is played on beatmaps, which can be seen as an array consisting of distinct points on a plane. A beatmap is called nice if for any three consecutive points
A,B,C
listed in order, the angle between these three points, centered at
B
, is strictly less than
90
degrees.
Points
A,B,C
on the left have angle less than
90
degrees, so they can be three consecutive points of a nice beatmap; Points
A′,B′,C′
on the right have angle greater or equal to
90
degrees, so they cannot be three consecutive points of a nice beatmap.
Now Nezzar has a beatmap of
n
distinct points
A1,A2,…,An
. Nezzar would like to reorder these
n
points so that the resulting beatmap is nice.
Formally, you are required to find a permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
of integers from
1
to
n
, such that beatmap
Ap1,Ap2,…,Apn
is nice. If it is impossible, you should determine it.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤5000
).
Then
n
lines follow,
i
-th of them contains two integers
xi
,
yi
(
−109≤xi,yi≤109
) — coordinates of point
Ai
.
It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.
Output
If there is no solution, print
−1
.
Otherwise, print
n
integers, representing a valid permutation
p
.
If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any.

Note
Here is the illustration for the first test:
Please note that the angle between
A1
,
A2
and
A5
, centered at
A2
, is treated as
0
degrees. However, angle between
A1
,
A5
and
A2
, centered at
A5
, is treated as
180
degrees.
