You are given a tree consisting of
n
vertices, and
q
triples
(xi,yi,si)
, where
xi
and
yi
are integers from
1
to
n
, and
si
is a string with length equal to the number of vertices on the simple path from
xi
to
yi
.
You want to write a lowercase Latin letter on each vertex in such a way that, for each of
q
given triples, at least one of the following conditions holds:
if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from
xi
to
yi
in the order they appear on this path, you get the string
si
;
if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from
yi
to
xi
in the order they appear on this path, you get the string
si
.
Find any possible way to write a letter on each vertex to meet these constraints, or report that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤4⋅105
;
1≤q≤4⋅105
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of triples, respectively.
Then
n−1
lines follow; the
i
-th of them contains two integers
ui
and
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
;
ui≠vi
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th edge. These edges form a tree.
Then
q
lines follow; the
j
-th of them contains two integers
xj
and
yj
, and a string
sj
consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of
sj
is equal to the number of vertices on the simple path between
xj
and
yj
.
Additional constraint on the input:
q
∑
j=1
|sj|≤4⋅105
.
Output
If there is no way to meet the conditions on all triples, print NO. Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and a string of
n
lowercase Latin letters in the second line; the
i
-th character of the string should be the letter you write on the
i
-th vertex. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
