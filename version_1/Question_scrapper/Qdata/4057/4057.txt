You are given four integers a, b, c and d. Determine if there's a rectangle such that the lengths of its sides are a, b, c and d (in any order).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers a, b, c and d.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string "YES" or "NO".
