Consider an array
B of length
M.
The beauty of
B is defined as
∑
i=1
M
∣B
i
−B
M+1−i
∣.
The score of
B is the maximum beauty over all permutations of
B.
You are given positive integers
N and
X.
Find the sum of scores of all arrays
A of length
N, such that
1≤A
i
≤X.
Since the sum might be large, please print it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
X — the number of elements in
A and the maximum allowed value of
A
i
, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the required sum, modulo
998244353.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N,X≤5000
The sum of
N over all testcases don't exceed
5000.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The arrays are:
[1,1]: Score of this array is
∣1−1∣+∣1−1∣=0.
[1,2]: Score of this array is
2 since rearrangement
[1,2] has maximum beauty.
[1,3]: Score of this array is
4 since rearrangement
[1,3] has maximum beauty.
[2,1]: Score of this array is
2 since rearrangement
[1,2] has maximum beauty.
[2,2]: Score of this array is
0.
[2,3]: Score of this array is
2 since rearrangement
[2,3] has maximum beauty.
[3,1]: Score of this array is
4 since rearrangement
[1,3] has maximum beauty.
[3,2]: Score of this array is
2 since rearrangement
[2,3] has maximum beauty.
[3,3]: Score of this array is
0.
The sum of scores is
2+4+2+2+4+2=16.
