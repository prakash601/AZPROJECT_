Hussain really likes problems that involve summation over X, where X can be subsets, paths in a tree, intervals of numbers etc.
You are given two integer sequences
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
,…,A
N
and
B
1
,B
2
,B
3
,…,B
N
. Consider an arbitrary non-empty subset
S of the set
{1,2,…,N}. Let's define the swagness of such a set as
(
(max
(p∈S)
A
p
)⋅(max
(p∈S)
B
p
).
Hussain is interested in the sum of swagnesses of all possible sets
S. (Note that there are
2
N
−1 such sets.) Since the sum may be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the total swagness modulo
10

+7.
