You are given a convex polygon with
N sides. You have to answer
Q queries. The
i
th
query is described by two integers
v
i
,t
i
. In this query, all sides of the polygon start moving parallel to their respective perpendicular vector away from the centroid with a constant velocity of
v
i
sec
units
. Output the final area covered by
N sides of the polygon after time
t
i
seconds.
For each query, consider the initial coordinates of vertices of the given polygon.
Note:
The problem requires high precision, so prefer using data types with a precision equivalent to long double in C++.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains
N+Q+1 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N,Q.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i
th
of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
,y
i
, coordinates of the
i
th
vertex of the polygon.
Next
Q lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i
th
of these lines contains two space-separated integers
v
i
,t
i
, description of the
i
th
query.
Output Format
For each query, output in a single line the final area covered by
N sides of the polygon.
Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed
10

Explanation:
Below are the images for the respective test cases. Inner polygons are the ones at the start and the rays represent the distance traveled by the sides at the given speed in a given time. Outer polygons denote the final ones after the movements of the sides.
