You are given a permutation
P of length
N, an array
A of size
N, and an integer
M.
Initially,
0≤A
i
≤M. Consider an array
A
′
obtained from
A by replacing all zeros in
A with positive integers less than or equal to
M.
The array
A
′
will then be transformed as follows, in
N steps:
In the
i
th
step, we set
A
i
′
=A
P
i
′
.
The initial array
A
′
is said to be beautiful, if, after the transformation of
N steps, all elements of array
A
′
are equal.
Find the number of such beautiful arrays
A
′
which can be formed by changing the zeros in array
A to any value
≤M. Since this number can be huge, print this number modulo
.
Note that a permutation of length
N contains of all elements from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M, the size of the array and the maximum value it can have.
The second line of each test case consists of
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: The given permutation is
[2,1,4,3]. One of the possible beautiful arrays is:
A
′
=[1,2,3,2]. This is obtained by replacing the first
0 with
1 and the second
0 with
3 in the array
A.
For the transformation:
In the first step,
A
1
′
is replaced with
A
P
1
′
=A
2
′
, that is
2. The array becomes
[2,2,3,2].
In the second step,
A
2
′
is replaced with
A
P
2
′
=A
1
′
, that is
2. The array becomes
[2,2,3,2].
In the third step,
A
3
′
is replaced with
A
P
3
′
=A
4
′
, that is
2. The array becomes
[2,2,2,2].
In the fourth step,
A
4
′
is replaced with
A
P
4
′
=A
3
′
, that is
2. The array becomes
[2,2,2,2].
Thus, after the transformation, all elements of the array are equal. The other beautiful arrays for this test case are:
[1,2,1,2],[1,2,2,2],[2,2,1,2],[2,2,2,2],[2,2,3,2],[3,2,1,2],[3,2,2,2],[3,2,3,2].
There are
9 beautiful arrays in total.
