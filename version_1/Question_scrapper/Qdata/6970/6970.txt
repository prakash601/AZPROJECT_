Alice thought of a function
F, which takes an arbitrary array of integers
A=(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
M
) as the only argument and is defined in the following way:
Consider all pairs of subarrays
(A
i
,A
i+1
,…,A
j
) and
(A
k
,A
k+1
,…,A
l
) such that:
1≤i≤j<k≤l≤M
both subarrays are non-decreasing
A
j
≤A
k
If there is no such pair of subarrays,
F(A)=0.
Otherwise,
F(A) is the maximum of the expression
(j−i+1)+(l− over all such pairs of subarrays.
In other words, you need to choose two non-overlapping non-empty subarrays of
A and concatenate them in the same order; the resulting array should be non-decreasing and
F(A) is its maximum possible length.
Bob challenged Alice to solve the following problem and she needs your help.
You are given a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N), rooted at the vertex
1. There is an integer written in each vertex; for each valid
i, let's denote the integer written in vertex
i by
V
i
. You should choose one vertex ― let's denote it by
v. Then, consider an array
A containing values which are written in vertices on the path from the root to
v (inclusive), in this order, and calculate
F(A). Find the maximum possible value of
F(A) which you can obtain this way.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
V

.
Each of the following
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that vertices
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum of
F(A).

Explanation:
Example case 1: We choose
v=3. Then,
A(3)=(2,5); its subarrays
(2) and
(5) satisfy all required conditions and the sum of their lengths is
2. There is no way to get a greater value of the function
F.
