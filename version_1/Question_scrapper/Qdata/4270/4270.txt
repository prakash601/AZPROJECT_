You are given two integers
N and
K. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): change
N to
N−K, i.e. subtract
K from
N. Find the smallest non-negative integer value of
N you can obtain this way.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest value you can get.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
First, we change
N=5 to
N−K=5−2=3.
Then, we have
N=3 and we change it to
N−K=3−2=1.
Since
1<K, the process stops here and the smallest value is
1.
Example case 2: We change
N=4 to
N−K=4−4=0. Since
0<K, the process stops here and the smallest value is
0.
Example case 3: Since
2<K initially, we should not perform any operations and the smallest value is
2.
