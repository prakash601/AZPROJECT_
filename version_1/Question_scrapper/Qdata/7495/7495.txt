You are given a directed graph
G with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and
M edges. Let's denote the set of its vertices by
V, the set of its edges by
E and an edge from a vertex
u to a vertex
v by
(u,v). Then, let's define:
For each
u,v∈V,
R(u,v) is true if
v can be reached from
u or false otherwise. Specifically, if
u=v, it is always true.
For each
v∈V, a set of vertices
N(v)={u∈V∣R(u,v)∧R(v,u)}.
For each subset
U⊆V, two sets of edges
Out(U)={(u,v)∈E∣u∈U} and
In(U)={(v,u)∈E∣u∈U}.
You need to assign a label to each edge in
E; you may only use labels
1 and
2. The costs of labelling an edge are
c
1
and
c
2
for the labels
and
respectively.
In the resulting graph,
Q constraints (numbered
1 through
Q) need to be satisfied. For each valid
i, the
i-th constraint is that the number of edges in a set
S
i
with the label
x
i
should be between
l
i
and
r
i
(inclusive);
S
i
is determined by a given vertex
w
i
and the type of this constraint
t
i
as follows:
t
i
=1:
S
i
=Out(N(w
i
))
t
i
=2:
S
i
=In(N(w
i
))
t
i
=3:
S
i
=Out({w
i
})
t
i
=4:
S
i
=In({w
i
})
Find the smallest cost of labelling all the edges in such a way that these
Q constraints are satisfied or determine that there is no solution satisfying all constraints.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
Q.
Each of the following
M lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting a directed edge
(u,v).
The next line contains two space-separated integers
c
1
and
c
2
.
Q lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains five space-separated integers
t
i
,
w
i
,
x
i
,
l
i
and
r
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest cost of labelling the edges or
−1 if it is impossible to label the edges in such a way that all constraints are satisfied.
