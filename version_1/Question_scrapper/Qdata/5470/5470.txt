Captain Dehatti from Bawanian village is making strategy to win the Fake Cricket World Cup organised in his village.
He want his team to score runs only in 4's and 6's because he believes that scoring any runs by running will make them tired.
He also wants that the team does not loose more than L wickets.
He now wonders in how many ways his team can score exactly R runs in B balls. Ofcourse, he assumes that the opponent bowling is awesome and will not concede any extra runs.
Formally, He wonders how many ways can his team score exactly R runs in B balls, given that each ball can result in 4, 6, 0 , or W(wicket wont add anything to score). Atmost L wicktes are allowed [i.e. Atmost L 'W' can be there in B balls ].
Note: His batting order is fixed i.e. After each wicket , next player to come is fixed.
Input
First line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains 3 space separated integers, R, B and L
Output
For each test cases output the number of ways modulo 1e9+7 (i.e. 1000000007)
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 25000
0 ≤ R ≤ 109
1 ≤ B ≤ 300
0 ≤ L ≤ 9
Note that the answer to R = 0 , B = 2 , W =1 is 3  [ 00 , 0W , W0 ]

Explanation for the sample input 1:
All possible ways to face 2 deliveries:
00 04 06 0W W0 W4 W6 WW 40 44 46 4W 60 64 66 6W
Only possible ways to win the match are 46 and 64. Hence answer is 2.
You need to consider all sample space i.e. 4^B
