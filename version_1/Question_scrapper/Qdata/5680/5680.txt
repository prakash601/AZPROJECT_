Cherry has a binary matrix
A consisting of
N rows and
M columns. The rows are numbered from
1 to
N, columns are numbered from
1 to
M. Element at row
i (
1 ≤
i ≤
N) and column
j (
1 ≤
j ≤
M) is denoted as
A
ij
. All elements of
A are either
0 or
1.
He performs
Q queries on matrix. Each query is provided by four integers
x
1
,
y
1
,
x
2
,
y
2
which define the rectangle, where (
x
1
,
y
1
) stands for the coordinates of the top left cell of the rectangle, while (
x
2
,
y
2
) stands for the coordinates of the bottom right cell. You need to flip all the bits i.e. (
0 to
1,
1 to
0) that are located fully inside the query rectangle.
Finally, print the matrix after performing all the queries.
Note:
x
1
represents the row number while
y
1
represents the column number.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains two integers
N and
M — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.
Each of the next
N lines contains a string of length
M, where the
j
th
character of
i
th
line denotes the value of
A
i,j
.
Next line contains an integer
Q — the number of queries.
Then follow
Q lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains four space-seperated integers
x
1
,
y
1
,
x
2
,
y
2
— coordinates of the up left and bottom right cells of the query rectangle.
###Output:
Print the matrix, in the form of
N strings, after performing all the queries.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
After processing the 1st query 1 1 1 1, matrix becomes:
[
[
10
00
] After processing the 2nd query 2 2 2 2, the matrix becomes:
[
[

01
] After processing the 3rd query 1 1 2 2, matrix becomes:
[
[

10
] We need to output the matrix after processing all queries.
