Chef has an array
A of
N elements denoted by
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
. He thinks about
M questions of following kind: "What is the maximum element among
A
i
where
i lies between
min(x,y) and
max(x,y) both inclusive?"
You have to help Chef to find out sum of answers of all the
M questions.
Method of generation of values
x and
y for all
M questions:
You are given two integers
x
1
and
y
1
denoting values of
x and
y for the first question. For the next questions, values of
x
i
and
y
i
are generated in the following way:
x
i
=(x
i−1
+7)%(N−1)
y
i
=(y
i−1
+11)%N
Where
% represents the modulo operation.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers, denoting
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
.
The third line contains three space-separated integers
M,
x
1
, and
y
1
.
Output
Output a single integer denoting the sum of the answers to the questions.

Explanation
The first question:
x
1
=0,
y
1
=1. Therefore answer for the first query
=2.
The second question:
x
2
=(0+7)%2=1,
y
2
=(1+11)%3=0. Therefore answer for the second query
=2
The third question:
x
3
=(1+7)%2=0,
y
3
=(0+11)%3=2 . Therefore answer for the third query
=3
Therefore, the sum of answers is
7.
