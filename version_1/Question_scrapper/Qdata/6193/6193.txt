Chef has a sequence
A of
N integers such that
∣A
i
∣≤1.
For each
x such that
−N≤x≤N, find the number of non-empty subsequences of
A whose sum of elements is
x. Since that answer may be too large, print this modulo
163,577,857.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
In the first test case, the non-empty subsequences with sum
0 are
{0} while the subsequences with sum
1 are
{1} and
{1,0}.
