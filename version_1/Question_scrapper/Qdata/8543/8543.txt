Is it really?! The robot only existing in my imagination?! The Colossal Walking Robot?!!
— Kochiya Sanae
Sanae made a giant robot — Hisoutensoku, but something is wrong with it. To make matters worse, Sanae can not figure out how to stop it, and she is forced to fix it on-the-fly.
The state of a robot can be represented by an array of integers of length
n
. Initially, the robot is at state
a
. She wishes to turn it into state
b
.
As a great programmer, Sanae knows the art of copy-and-paste. In one operation, she can choose some segment from given segments, copy the segment from
b
and paste it into the same place of the robot, replacing the original state there. However, she has to ensure that the sum of
a
does not change after each copy operation in case the robot go haywire. Formally, Sanae can choose segment
[l,r]
and assign
ai=bi
(
l≤i≤r
) if
n
∑
i=1
ai
does not change after the operation.
Determine whether it is possible for Sanae to successfully turn the robot from the initial state
a
to the desired state
b
with any (possibly, zero) operations.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅104
) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
m
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
,
1≤m≤2⋅105
) — the length of
a
,
b
and the number of segments.
The second line contains
n
intergers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the initial state
a
.
The third line contains
n
intergers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤109
) — the desired state
b
.
Then
m
lines follow, the
i
-th line contains two intergers
li,ri
(
1≤li<ri≤n
) — the segments that can be copy-pasted by Sanae.
It is guaranteed that both the sum of
n
and the sum of
m
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if
a
can be turned into
b
, or "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
Test case 1:
One possible way of turning
a
to
b
:
First, select
[1,3]
. After the operation,
a=[3,2,5,2,3]
.
Then, select
[2,5]
. After the operation,
a=[3,2,5,4,1]=b
.
Test case 2:
It can be shown that it is impossible to turn
a
into
b
.
