Chef has
3 numbers
P,
Q and
R. Chef wants to find the number of triples
(A,B,C) such that:
(A∣B)=P,
(B∣C)=Q and
(C∣A)=R (Here,
∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation)
0≤A,B,C<2
20
Can you help Chef?

Explanation:
Test case
1: The following
4 triplets
(A,B,C) satisfy
A∣B=10,B∣C=12, and
C∣A=14:
(2,8,12),(10,0,12),(10,8,4), and
(10,8,12).
Test case
2: The following triplet
(A,B,C) satisfies
A∣B=0,B∣C=5, and
C∣A=5:
(0,0,5).
Test case
3: There are no triplets satisfying all the conditions.
