You are given a set
S, which is a subset of
{1,2,…,N}.
Consider a permutation
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
of the integers
1 through
N. The cost of this permutation is the number of indices
i>1 such that
P
i
is divisible by
P
i−1
and
P
i−1
P
i
∈S.
For each
k between
0 and
N−1 (inclusive), find the number of permutations with cost
k. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains a binary string
T with length
N. For each valid
i, the
i-th character of
T is '1' if
i∈S or '0' otherwise.
Output
Print a single line containing
N space-separated integers. For each
k (
0≤k<N), the
k+1-th of these integers should be the number of permutations with cost
k, modulo
998,244,353.
Constraints
1≤N≤40
T contains only characters '0' and '1'
