Given an array of size n such that each element contains either a 'P' for policeman or a 'T' for thief. Find the maximum number of thieves that can be caught by the police. 
Keep in mind the following conditions :
Each policeman can catch only one thief.
A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than K units away from him.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, K = 1
arr[] = {P, T, T, P, T}
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum 2 thieves can be 
caught. First policeman catches first thief 
and second police man can catch either second 
or third thief.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 6, K = 2
arr[] = {T, T, P, P, T, P}
Output: 3
Explanation: Maximum 3 thieves can be caught.
Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function catchThieves() that takes n, k and arr[ ] as input parameters and returns the maximum number of thieves that can be caught by the police. 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ k ≤ 100
arr[i] = 'P' or 'T'
