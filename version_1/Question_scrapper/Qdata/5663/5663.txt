Initially, there is a magical stone of mass
2
N
lying at the origin of the number line. For the next
N seconds, the following event happens:
Let us define the decomposition of a magical stone as follows: If there is a magical stone of mass
M>1 lying at coordinate
X, then it decomposes into two magical stones, each of mass
2
M
lying at the coordinates
X−1 and
X+1 respectively. The original stone of mass
M gets destroyed in the process.
Each second, all the magical stones undergo decomposition simultaneously.
Note that there can be more than one stone at any coordinate
X.
Given a range
[L,R], find out the number of stones present at each of the coordinates in the range
[L,R]. As the number of stones can be very large, output them modulo
(10
9
+7).
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers
N,
L and
R, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line a total of
(R−L+1) space-separated integers. The
i
th
integer will denote the number of stones present at
X=(L+i−1) coordinate. As the number of stones can be very large, output them modulo
(10
9
+7).

Explanation:
Test case 1: Let us look at the number of stones for
x=−2 to
x=2 as the time progresses:
t=0:
{0,0,1,0,0}
t=1:
{0,1,0,1,0}
t=2:
{1,0,2,0,1}
We have to output the number of stones at
x=−2 to
x=2, which is
{1,0,2,0,1}.
Test case 2: Similar to first test case, We have to output the number of stones at
x=0 to
x=2, which is
{2,0,1}.
