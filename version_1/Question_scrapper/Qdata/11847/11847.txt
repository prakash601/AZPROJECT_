Bajtek, known for his unusual gifts, recently got an integer array
x0,x1,…,xk−1
.
Unfortunately, after a huge array-party with his extraordinary friends, he realized that he'd lost it. After hours spent on searching for a new toy, Bajtek found on the arrays producer's website another array
a
of length
n+1
. As a formal description of
a
says,
a0=0
and for all other
i
 (
1≤i≤n
)
ai=x(i−1)modk+ai−1
, where
pmodq
denotes the remainder of division
p
by
q
.
For example, if the
x=[1,2,3]
and
n=5
, then:
a0=0
,
a1=x0mod3+a0=x0+0=1
,
a2=x1mod3+a1=x1+1=3
,
a3=x2mod3+a2=x2+3=6
,
a4=x3mod3+a3=x0+6=7
,
a5=x4mod3+a4=x1+7=9
.
So, if the
x=[1,2,3]
and
n=5
, then
a=[0,1,3,6,7,9]
.
Now the boy hopes that he will be able to restore
x
from
a
! Knowing that
1≤k≤n
, help him and find all possible values of
k
 — possible lengths of the lost array.
Input
The first line contains exactly one integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the length of the array
a
, excluding the element
a0
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤106
).
Note that
a0
is always
0
and is not given in the input.
Output
The first line of the output should contain one integer
l
denoting the number of correct lengths of the lost array.
The second line of the output should contain
l
integers — possible lengths of the lost array in increasing order.

Note
In the first example, any
k
is suitable, since
a
is an arithmetic progression.
Possible arrays
x
:
[1]
[1,1]
[1,1,1]
[1,1,1,1]
[1,1,1,1,1]
In the second example, Bajtek's array can have three or five elements.
Possible arrays
x
:
[1,2,2]
[1,2,2,1,2]
For example,
k=4
is bad, since it leads to
6+x0=8
and
0+x0=1
, which is an obvious contradiction.
In the third example, only
k=n
is good.
Array
[1,4,−2]
satisfies the requirements.
Note that
xi
may be negative.
