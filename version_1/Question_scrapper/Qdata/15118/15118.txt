You've got an array, consisting of n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. Your task is to quickly run the queries of two types:
Assign value x to all elements from l to r inclusive. After such query the values of the elements of array al, al + 1, ..., ar become equal to x.
Calculate and print sum , where k doesn't exceed 5. As the value of the sum can be rather large, you should print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), showing, how many numbers are in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly. The second line contains n integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the initial values of the array elements.
Then m queries follow, one per line:
The assign query has the following format: "", (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; 0 ≤ x ≤ 109).
The query to calculate the sum has the following format: "", (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; 0 ≤ k ≤ 5).
All numbers in the input are integers.
Output
For each query to calculate the sum print an integer — the required sum modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
