Vitya has learned that the answer for The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not the integer 54 42, but an increasing integer sequence
a1,…,an
. In order to not reveal the secret earlier than needed, Vitya encrypted the answer and obtained the sequence
b1,…,bn
using the following rules:
b1=a1
;
bi=ai⊕ai−1
for all
i
from 2 to
n
, where
x⊕y
is the bitwise XOR of
x
and
y
.
It is easy to see that the original sequence can be obtained using the rule
ai=b1⊕…⊕bi
.
However, some time later Vitya discovered that the integers
bi
in the cypher got shuffled, and it can happen that when decrypted using the rule mentioned above, it can produce a sequence that is not increasing. In order to save his reputation in the scientific community, Vasya decided to find some permutation of integers
bi
so that the sequence
ai=b1⊕…⊕bi
is strictly increasing. Help him find such a permutation or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
b1,…,bn
(
1≤bi<260
).
Output
If there are no valid permutations, print a single line containing "No".
Otherwise in the first line print the word "Yes", and in the second line print integers
b
′
1
,…,b
′
n
 — a valid permutation of integers
bi
. The unordered multisets
{b1,…,bn}
and
{b
′
1
,…,b
′
n
}
should be equal, i. e. for each integer
x
the number of occurrences of
x
in the first multiset should be equal to the number of occurrences of
x
in the second multiset. Apart from this, the sequence
ai=b
′
1
⊕…⊕b
′
i
should be strictly increasing.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
In the first example no permutation is valid.
In the second example the given answer lead to the sequence
a1=4
,
a2=8

a5=23
,
a6=42
