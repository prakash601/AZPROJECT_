Given two numbers L and R (inclusive) find the product of primes within this range. Print the product modulo 109+7. If there are no primes in that range you must print 1.
Example 1:
Input: L = 1, R = 10
Output: 210
Explaination: The prime numbers are 
2, 3, 5 and 7.
Example 2:
Input: L = 1, R = 20
Output: 9699690
Explaination: The primes are 2, 3, 
5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function primeProduct() which takes L and R and returns the product of the primes within the range. If there are no primes in that range then return 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O((R-L)*(logR))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(sqrt(R))
Constraints:
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 109
0 ≤ L - R ≤ 106
