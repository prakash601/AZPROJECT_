You are given two sets of positive integers
A
and
B
. You have to find two non-empty subsets
SA⊆A
,
SB⊆B
so that the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements of
SA
is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements of
SB
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤200
), the number of test cases.
For each test case, there is one line containing two integers
n,m
(
1≤n,m≤1000
), the sizes of the sets
A
and
B
, respectively.
The next line contains
n
distinct integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤4⋅1036
), the elements of
A
.
The next line contains
m
distinct integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
1≤bi≤4⋅1036
), the elements of
B
.
The sum of
n
for all test cases and the sum of
m
for all test cases is at most
1000
.
Output
For each test case, if there do not exist two subsets with equal least common multiple, output one line with NO.
Otherwise, output one line with YES, followed by a line with two integers
|SA|,|SB|
(
1≤|SA|≤n
,
1≤|SB|≤m
), the sizes of the subsets
SA
and
SB
The next line should contain
|SA|
integers
x1,x2,…,x|SA|
, the elements of
SA
, followed by a line with
|SB|
integers
y1,y2,…,y|SB|
, the elements of
SB
. If there are multiple possible pairs of subsets, you can print any.
