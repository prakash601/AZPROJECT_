This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version,
ai≤106
.
For a given sequence of
n
integers
a
, a triple
(i,j,k)
is called magic if:
1≤i,j,k≤n
.
i
,
j
,
k
are pairwise distinct.
there exists a positive integer
b
such that
ai⋅b=aj
and
aj⋅b=ak
.
Kolya received a sequence of integers
a
as a gift and now wants to count the number of magic triples for it. Help him with this task!
Note that there are no constraints on the order of integers
i
,
j
and
k
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of the test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the sequence.
The second line of the test contains
n
integers
a1,a2,a3,…,an
(
1≤ai≤106
) — the elements of the sequence
a
.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of magic triples for the sequence
a
.

Note
In the first example, there are
6
magic triples for the sequence
a
 —
(2,3,5)
,
(2,5,3)
,
(3,2,5)
,
(3,5,2)
,
(5,2,3)
,
(5,3,2)

In the second example, there is a single magic triple for the sequence
a
 —
(2,1,3)
.
