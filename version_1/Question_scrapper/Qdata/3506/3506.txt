Chef wants to appear in a competitive exam. To take the exam, there are following requirements:
Minimum age limit is
X (i.e. Age should be greater than or equal to
X).
Age should be strictly less than
Y.
Chef's current Age is
A. Find whether he is currently eligible to take the exam or not.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three integers
X,Y, and
A as mentioned in the statement.
For each test case, output YES if Chef is eligible to give the exam, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
20≤X<Y≤40
10≤A≤50

Explanation:
Test case
1: The age of Chef is
30. His age satisfies the minimum age limit as
30≥21. Also, it is less than the upper limit as
30<34. Thus, Chef is eligible to take the exam.
Test case
2: The age of Chef is
31. His age satisfies the minimum age limit as
31≥25. But, it is not less than the upper limit as
31≮31. Thus, Chef is not eligible to take the exam.
Test case
3: The age of Chef is
25. His age satisfies the minimum age limit as
25≥22. Also, it is less than the upper limit as
25<29. Thus, Chef is eligible to take the exam.
Test case
4: The age of Chef is
15. His age does not satisfy the minimum age limit as
15<20. Thus, Chef is not eligible to take the exam.
