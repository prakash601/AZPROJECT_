You are given a tree with
n
weighted vertices labeled from
1
to
n
rooted at vertex
1
. The parent of vertex
i
is
pi
and the weight of vertex
i
is
ai
. For convenience, define
p1=0
.
For two vertices
x
and
y
of the same depth
†
, define
f(x,y)
as follows:
Initialize
ans=0
.
While both
x
and
y
are not
0
:
ans←ans+ax⋅ay
;
x←px
;
y←py
.
f(x,y)
is the value of
ans
.
You will process
q
queries. In the
i
-th query, you are given two integers
xi
and
yi
and you need to calculate
f(xi,yi)
.
†
The depth of vertex
v
is the number of edges on the unique simple path from the root of the tree to vertex
v
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤105
;
1≤q≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤105
).
The third line contains
n−1
integers
p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi<i
).
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤n
). It is guaranteed that
xi
and
yi
are of the same depth.
Output
Output
q
lines, the
i
-th line contains a single integer, the value of
f(xi,yi)
.

Note
Consider the first example:
In the first query, the answer is
a4⋅a5+a3⋅a3+a2⋅a2+a1⋅a1=3+4+25+1=33
.
In the second query, the answer is
a6⋅a6+a2⋅a2+a1⋅a1=1+25+1=27
.
