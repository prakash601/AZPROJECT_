We've learnt about operators and other basics of Java Now, it's time to take another leap and learn to use control structures that helps us choose flow of any code.
Given two integers A and B. Your task is to print the even number first and odd number next in individual lines.
Input Fomat:
First line of input contains number of testcases denoted by T. For each testcase, there will be single line containing a and b separated by space.
Output Fomat:
For each testcase, print the even number first and odd number next in individual lines.
User Task:
Sinc this is a function problem, you don't have to take any input. You just have to complete the function evenOdd().
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= A,B <= 108
Example:
Input:
1
4 5
Output:
4
5
Example:
Testcase 1: 4 is even and printed first. 5 is odd and printed next.
