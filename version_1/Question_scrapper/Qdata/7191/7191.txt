The or-weight of a weighted tree is defined as the bitwise-or of the weights of all edges of the tree.
You are given an undirected weighted connected graph with
N nodes and
M edges.
Your task is to find the spanning tree with minimum or-weight.
You should answer
Q queries. For the
i
th
query:
We add an undirected edge between nodes
x
i
and
y
i
with weight
0.
You should output the answer after each modification.
Note:
Each query is independent. In other words, we modify on the original graph each time.
An undirected graph has edges with no direction.
A weighted graph is a graph where a weight is assigned to each edge.
A connected graph is a graph where every pair of nodes is connected.
Input Format
The first line of contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
Q — the number of nodes, edges and queries, respectively.
The next
M lines describe the edges. The
i
th
of these
M lines contain three space-separated integers
u
i
,
v
i
and
w
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
with weight
w
i
.
The next
Q lines describe the queries. The
i
th
of these
Q lines contain two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
, denoting that we add an undirected edge between nodes
x
i
and
y
i
with weight
0.
Output Format
For each query, output on a new line - the minimum or-weight of a spanning tree after adding a new edge.
