Chef has a binary string
S of length
N. Chef can perform the following operation on
S any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose a number
X (
1≤X≤N) that hasn't been chosen in any previous operation and flip any substring of
S having length
X (i.e. change all
0s to
1s and all
1s to
0s in any substring of
S having length
X).
Chef wants to transform
S into a non-decreasing string using any sequence of operations. Can you help Chef find such a sequence of operations?
If there are multiple answers, print any.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the binary string
S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S of length
N containing
0s and
1s only.
Output Format
For each test case,
Output in the first line
K - the number of operations applied.
In each of the following
K lines, output two integers
i and
X - the starting index of the substring selected and the length of the substring. (Note that
X selected should not be used in any of the previous operations)
