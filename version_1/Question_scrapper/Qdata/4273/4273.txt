Alice has an array
A of length
N which is initially a permutation. She dislikes
K numbers which are
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
K
all of which are distinct. Therefore, she removes all the occurrences of these numbers from
A. The order of the remaining elements of the
A does not change.
Can you find out the resulting array
A?
Note: A permutation of length
N is an array where every integer from
1 to
N occurs exactly once.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
— the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A

denoting the array
A.
The third line of each test case contains an integer
K — the size of the array
B.
The fourth line of each test case contains
K integers
B

K
denoting the numbers which Alice dislikes.
Output Format
For each test case, output the resulting array
A after the removal of all occurrences of
B

It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the resulting array.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Here
A=[4,1,3,2] and
B=[3,1]. The resulting array
A after removing all the numbers which Alice dislikes is
[4,2].
Note that here
[2,4] is an incorrect answer since the order of elements should be the same as in the original array.
Test Case 2: Here
A=[5,2,9,1,8,6,4,3,7] and
B=[5,8,9]. The resulting array
A after removing all the numbers which Alice dislikes is
[2,1,6,4,3,7].
Test Case 3: Here
A=[3,4,5,1,2] and
B=[2,3]. The resulting array
A after removing all the numbers which Alice dislikes is
[4,5,1].
