A tennis tournament is about to take place with
N players participating in it. Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser.
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer
N denoting number of players.
If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print
N lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size
N.
If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between
i and
j ,
i wins.
You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.
###Constraints
1≤T≤100
2≤N≤100
###Subtasks
10 points :
2≤N≤6
90 points : Original Constraints.
