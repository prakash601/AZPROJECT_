You are given the sequence of integers
a1,a2,…,an
of length
n
.
The sequence of indices
i1<i2<…<ik
of length
k
denotes the subsequence
ai1,ai2,…,aik
of length
k
of sequence
a
.
The subsequence
ai1,ai2,…,aik
of length
k
of sequence
a
is called increasing subsequence if
aij<aij+1
for each
1≤j<k
.
The weight of the increasing subsequence
ai1,ai2,…,aik
of length
k
of sequence
a
is the number of
1≤j≤k
, such that exists index
ik<x≤n
and
ax>aij
.
For example, if
a=[6,4,8,6,5]
, then the sequence of indices
i=[2,4]
denotes increasing subsequence
[4,6]
of sequence
a
. The weight of this increasing subsequence is
1
, because for
j=1
exists
x=5
and
a5=5>ai1=4
, but for
j=2
such
x
doesn't exist.
Find the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences of
a
modulo
109+7
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the sequence
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the sequence
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences
a
modulo
109+7
.

Note
In the first test case the following increasing subsequences of
a
have not zero weight:
The weight of
[a1]=[6]
is
1
.
The weight of
[a2]=[4]
is
1
.
The weight of
[a2,a3]=[4,8]
is
1
.
The weight of
[a2,a4]=[4,6]
is
1
.
The sum of weights of increasing subsequences is
4
.
In the second test case there are
7
increasing subsequences of
a
with not zero weight:
3
with weight
1
,
3
with weight
2
and
1
with weight
3
. The sum of weights is
12
.
