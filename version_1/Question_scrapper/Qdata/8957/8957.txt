You are given a rooted tree consisting of
n
vertices numbered from
1
to
n
. The root of the tree is the vertex
1
.
You have to color all vertices of the tree into
n
colors (also numbered from
1
to
n
) so that there is exactly one vertex for each color. Let
ci
be the color of vertex
i
, and
pi
be the parent of vertex
i
in the rooted tree. The coloring is considered beautiful if there is no vertex
k
(
k>1
) such that
ck=cpk−1
, i. e. no vertex such that its color is less than the color of its parent by exactly
1
.
Calculate the number of beautiful colorings, and print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤250000
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Then
n−1
lines follow, the
i
-th line contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤n
;
xi≠yi
) denoting an edge between the vertex
xi
and the vertex
yi
. These edges form a tree.
Output
Print one integer — the number of beautiful colorings, taken modulo
998244353
.
