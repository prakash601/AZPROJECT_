Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in
x units of time, he finishes it in
m∗x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max
d units of time. Given
x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers
x,m,d.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Explanation:
TestCase
1: Chef takes
1∗1=1 unit of time which is equal to the upper bound(
1+0=1 unit) to do the work.
TestCase
2: Chef takes
min(1∗3,1+1)=min(3,2)=2 units of time to do the work.
TestCase
3: Chef takes
2∗2=4 units of time which is less than the upper bound(
2+3=5 units) to do the work.
