Given a string S, composed of different combinations of '(' , ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'. The task is to verify the validity of the arrangement.
An input string is valid if:
         1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
         2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Example 1:
Input:
S = ()[]{}
Output: 1
Explanation: The arrangement is valid.
  Example 2:
S = ())({}
Output: 0
Explanation: Arrangement is not valid.
Example 3:
Input:
S = ([)]
Output: 0
Explanation: Arrangement is not valid.
  Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function valid() which takes S as input and returns a boolean value denoting whether the arrangement is valid or not.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the length of S.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
