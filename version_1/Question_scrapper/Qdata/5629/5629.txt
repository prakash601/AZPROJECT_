Kulyash loves perfect squares and hates perfect cubes.
For any natural number
N,
F(N)=number of perfect squares smaller than or equal to N−number of positive perfect cubes smaller than or equal to N.
Kulyash gives you an integer
X and asks you to find the minimum value of
N, such that
F(N)≥X.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
X.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum value of
N such that
F(N)≥X.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
2 perfect squares from
1 to
4, and
1 perfect cube from
1 to
4, so
F(4)=2−1=1, as required.
Test case
2: There are
5 perfect squares from
1 to
25, and
2 perfect cubes from
1 to
25, so
F(25)=5−2=3, as required.
Test case
3: There are
3376 perfect squares from
1 to
11397376, and
225 perfect cubes from
1 to
11397376, so
F(11397376)=3376−225=3151, as required.
