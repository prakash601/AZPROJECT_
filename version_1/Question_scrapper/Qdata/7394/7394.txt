You are given two numbers
N and
M. A pair of arrays
(A,B) is called beautiful if and only if:
∣A∣=∣B∣=N (i.e. both their lengths are equal to
N);
For all
1≤i≤N,
1≤A
i
≤M and
1≤B
i
≤M;
median(A)≤median(B);
A is lexicographically smaller than
B.
Find the number of beautiful pairs of arrays. Since this number can be huge, print it modulo
MOD.
Note:
median(X) denotes the
⌈
2
∣X∣
⌉
th
element after sorting the array
X.
An array
X is lexicographically smaller than
Y if and only if there exists some index
such that
i
i
and
j
j
for
.
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains three integers
N,
M,
MOD - the parameters defined in the statement.
Output Format
Output a single integer - the number of beautiful pairs modulo
MOD.
Constraints
1≤N≤50
1≤M≤200
2≤MOD≤10

Sample 1:
Input
Output
2 2 204789219
6
Explanation:
All the arrays of length
2 with values in range
[1,2] are :
[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]. These arrays can form the following beautiful pairs:
([1,1],[1,2])
([1,1],[2,1])
([1,1],[2,2])
([1,2],[2,1])
([1,2],[2,2])
([2,1],[2,2])
Thus, we should print
6 mod
204789219=6.

Explanation:
This sample has a beautiful explination, but unfortunately, it is too long to write.
