There are
2 trains
A and
B and
N stations in a line from
1 to
N in order. There is also an array
P of length
N−1 such that
P
i
(1≤i<N) denotes the amount of time any train takes to go from the
i-th station to the
(i+1)-th station.
Initially, both trains are at station
1. Train
A departs from station
1 and stops directly at station
N. For safety purposes, it is maintained that train
B cannot depart from station
i unless train
A has already reached station
(i+1)
(1≤i<N).
Find the minimum time after which train
B reaches station
N, once train
A departs from station
1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, denoting number of stations.
The next line contains
N−1 space-separated integers,
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N−1
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum time after which train
B reaches station
N.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
A reaches station
2 at
t=4 and at this time
B departs from station
1 and reaches station
2 at
t=4+4=8.
Test case
2: Following is the timeline of two trains-
At
t=3,
A reaches station
2 and
B departs from station
1.
At
t=6,
B reaches station
2 but
A has not yet reached station
3, so train
B will wait at station
2.
At
t=8,
A reaches station
3 and
B departs from station
2.
At
t=8+5=13, train
B reaches station
3.
