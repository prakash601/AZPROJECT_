One day, Chef's friend gave him a wrong number
W containing
N+1 digits and said that the actual number
A is the largest possible number that can be obtained from deleting exactly one digit of
W. Chef was able to find
A but forgot
W.
Given
A, find the smallest possible number
W of length
N+1 without leading
0's that is consistent with the story above. We can show that there is always at least one such
W consistent with the story.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, an integer
A.
###Output For each testcase, output in a single line string representing the answer to the problem.
###Constraints
1≤T≤100
0≤A
i
≤9 for all valid
i, where
A
i
denotes the
i-th digit of
A
A


=0 (no leading zero)
10≤∣A∣≤5000, where
∣A∣ denotes the number of digits of
A

Explanation:
It can be proven that the above output strings are the smallest possible numbers from which you can arrive at the correct number in the input.
