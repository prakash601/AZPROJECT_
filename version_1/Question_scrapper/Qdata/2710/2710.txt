Given a decimal number m. Convert it into a binary string and apply n iterations, in each iteration 0 becomes 01, and 1 becomes 10. Find the kth (1-indexing) character in the string after the nth iteration.
Example 1:
Input: m = 5, n = 2, k = 5
output: 0
Explanation: Binary representation of m 
is "101", after one iteration binary 
representation will be "100110", and after 
second iteration binary representation 
will be "100101101001".

Your task:
You do not need to read any input or print anything. The task is to complete the function kthCharacter(), which takes 3 integers m, n, and k as input and returns a character.
Expected Time Complexity: O(2n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(2n)
Constraints:
0 ≤ m ≤ 50
0 ≤ n ≤ 10
K is a valid index
