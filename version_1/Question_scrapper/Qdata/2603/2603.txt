Given two integers M and N, generate all primes between M and N including M and N.
Example 1:
Input:
M=1,N=10
Output:
2 3 5 7
Explanation:
The prime numbers between 1 and 10
are 2,3,5 and 7.
Example 2:
Input:
M=2, N=5
Output:
2,3,5

The prime numbers between 2 and 5 are 
2,3 and 5.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function primeRange() which takes 2 integer inputs M and N and returns a list of all primes between M and N including N and M.

Expected Time Complexity:O(N*sqrt(N))
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=M<=N<=106
