Mainak has a convex polygon
P
with
n
vertices labelled as
A1,A2,…,An
in a counter-clockwise fashion. The coordinates of the
i
-th point
Ai
are given by
(xi,yi)
, where
xi
and
yi
are both integers.
Further, it is known that the interior angle at
Ai
is either a right angle or a proper obtuse angle. Formally it is known that:
90∘≤∠Ai−1AiAi+1<180∘
,
∀i∈{1,2,…,n}
where we conventionally consider
A0=An
and
An+1=A1
.
Mainak's friend insisted that all points
Q
such that there exists a chord of the polygon
P
passing through
Q
with length not exceeding
1
, must be coloured
red
.
Mainak wants you to find the area of the coloured region formed by the
red
points.
Formally, determine the area of the region
S={Q∈P
|
Q is coloured red}
.
Recall that a chord of a polygon is a line segment between two points lying on the boundary (i.e. vertices or points on edges) of the polygon.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
4≤n≤5000
) — the number of vertices of a polygon
P
.
The
i
-th line of the next
n
lines contain two integers
xi
and
yi
(
−109≤xi,yi≤109
) — the coordinates of
Ai
.
Additional constraint on the input: The vertices form a convex polygon and are listed in counter-clockwise order. It is also guaranteed that all interior angles are in the range
[90∘;180∘)
.
Output
Print the area of the region coloured in
red
.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10−4
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤10−4
.
