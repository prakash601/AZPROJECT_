There is a strange game played in ChefLand.
The game starts with
N white balls, the
i-th of which has a power of
S
i
. It is known that
0≤S
i
≤9. On each level, a black ball with power
K hits each of the white balls. After the collision, the power of each white ball is multiplied by
K.
However, white balls are only allowed to have single-digit power. In order to maintain this, a white ball whose power contains multiple digits splits into several white balls with single-digit power, one per digit.
For example, consider a white ball with a power of
4.
If
K=2, its resulting power is
8 and it remains a single ball.
If
K=13, its resulting power is
52, so it splits into two white balls with power
5 and
2 respectively.
If
K=27, its resulting power is
108, so it splits into three white balls with power
1,
0, and
8 respectively.
The aim of the game is to determine the number of white balls after
M levels. Note that
K remains the same for every level.
Please help Chef win the game. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo
10

+7.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
K, and
M.
The second line of each test case contains a string
S of length
N, where
S
i
is the initial power of
i-th ball.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the number of white balls at the end of the game, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
Initially
S=5418
After the
1
st
, level
S=4536972
After the
2
nd
level,
S=36452754816318
There are
14 white balls, so the answer is
14.
Test case
3: After each level,
S=0. So, the answer is
1.
