Given a vector of N positive integers. Your task is to print the vector elements in reverse order.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
vector -> 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 
5 4 3 2 1
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= V[i] <= 1012
User Task:
Your task is to complete the function reverseIterator() which accepts it1 and it2, starting and ending iterators as two parameters and prints the vector elements in reverse order.
