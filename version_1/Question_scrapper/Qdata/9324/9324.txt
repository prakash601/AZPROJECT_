This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version
1≤q≤105
. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
There is a process that takes place on arrays
a
and
b
of length
n
and length
n−1
respectively.
The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows:
First, choose a random integer
i
(
1≤i≤n−1
).
Then, simultaneously set
ai=min(ai,
ai+ai+1−bi
2
)
and
ai+1=max(ai+1,
ai+ai+1+bi
2
)
without any rounding (so values may become non-integer).
See notes for an example of an operation.
It can be proven that array
a
converges, i. e. for each
i
there exists a limit
ai
converges to. Let function
F(a,b)
return the value
a1
converges to after a process on
a
and
b
.
You are given array
b
, but not array
a
. However, you are given a third array
c
. Array
a
is good if it contains only integers and satisfies
0≤ai≤ci
for
1≤i≤n
.
Your task is to count the number of good arrays
a
where
F(a,b)≥x
for
q
values of
x
. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo
109+7
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
).
The second line contains
n
integers
c1,c2…,cn
(
0≤ci≤100
).
The third line contains
n−1
integers
b1,b2,…,bn−1
(
0≤bi≤100
).
The fourth line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤105
).
The fifth line contains
q
space separated integers
x1,x2,…,xq
(
−105≤xi≤105
).
Output
Output
q
integers, where the
i
-th integer is the answer to the
i
-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays
a
where
F(a,b)≥xi
modulo
109+7
.

Note
The following explanation assumes
b=[2,1]
and
c=[2,3,4]
(as in the sample).
Examples of arrays
a
that are not good:
a=[3,2,3]
is not good because
a1>c1
;
a=[0,−1,3]
is not good because
a2<0
.
One possible good array
a
is
[0,2,4]
. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so
F(a,b)=a1=0
.
Another possible good array
a
is
[0,1,4]
. In a single operation with
i=1
, we set
a1=min(
0+1−2
2
,0)
and
a2=max(
0+1+2
2
,1)
. So, after a single operation with
i=1
,
a
becomes equal to
[−
1
2
,
3
2
,4]
. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so
F(a,b)=−

.
