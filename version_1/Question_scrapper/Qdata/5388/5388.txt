You are given a positive integer
K and a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Initially, each element of this sequence is
0 or
1; your goal is to make all elements equal to
0.
In order to do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times:
Choose a subarray (a contiguous subsequence) with length
K, i.e. choose two indices
L and
R such that
1≤L≤R≤N and
R−L+1=K.
Choose one element of that subarray and change it to
0, i.e. choose an index
P such that
L≤P≤R and change
A
to
0.
The cost of this operation is the sum of this subarray
A
L
+A
L+1
+…+A
R
before
A
P
is changed.
Find the minimum total cost (sum of costs of individual operations) of making all elements of
A equal to
0.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost of turning all elements of
A into zeros.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The minimum cost is
3 and it can be obtained using the following sequence of operations:
choose the subarray
[L,R]=[2,4] and set
A
3
=0 with cost
1
choose the subarray
[1,3] and set
A
1
=0 with cost
1
choose the subarray
[3,5] and set
A
5
=0 with cost
1
Example case 2: We have to choose the whole sequence (
[L,R]=[1,4]) in each operation, so the total cost is
3+2+1=6:
choose the subarray
[1,4] and set
A
1
=0 with cost
3
choose the subarray
[1,4] and set
A
2
=0 with cost
2
choose the subarray
[1,4] and set
A
4
=0 with cost
1
Example case 3: The minimum cost is
2 and it can be obtained using the following sequence of operations:
choose the subarray
[2,2] and set
A
2
=0 with cost
1
choose the subarray
[1,1] and set
A
1
=0 with cost
