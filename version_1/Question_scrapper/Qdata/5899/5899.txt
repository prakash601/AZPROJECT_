  Donald: "Be careful! I need the girl"
Logan: "What Girl??"
Donald Pierce and his enforcers, the Reavers have captured Canibal, and have attacked Logan and Xavier.
Prof. Charles Xavier proposes a plan. He is currently assessing several strings, and the answer lies in the common prefix of those strings.
Charles asks Logan for rendering help.
Logan is provided with some N strings – Str[1], Str[2],......Str[N] , and he must tell Charles the number of BRUTAL SUBSEQUENCES of size more than 1.
Consider you have a subsequence of size k – Str[i1], Str[i2] , Str[i3] ,....Str[ik], and i1 < i2 < i3 < ......< ik. And let us say that we have 2 symbols- ‘((‘ and ‘))’.
StrA (( StrB denotes that StrA has length strictly less than that of StrB ,and both have some common prefix.
StrA )) StrB denotes that StrB has length strictly less than that of StrA ,and both have some common prefix.
Now, a Brutal Subsequence of size k is defined as follows-
Str[i1] (( Str[i2] )) Str[i3] (( Str[i4] )) ......
OR
  Str[i1] )) Str[i2] (( Str[i3] )) Str[i4] (( ......
Two subsequences are considered to be different if their sizes are not same or they have atleast one constituent index which is not same.
Logan proposed a solution to this problem, but Charles is certain that the solution is not perfectly correct.
To stop their unnecessary quarrel, you need to help both of them.
Input
First line contains an integer N denoting the number of strings.
Next N lines contains the string where string on ith line denotes Str[i].
  Output
Print the number of Brutal Subsequences. As the answer can be very large print it modulo 109+7.
  Constraints
All strings comprise lower case characters only ['a'-'z']
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ |Str[i]| ≤ 105
1 ≤ Sum of the length of all strings ≤ 106
  Example
Input:
5
wolverine
wolverinexmen
wolv
perl
pe
Output:
5
  Explanation
The 5 brutal subsequences are-
wolverine (( wolverinexmen
wolverine )) wolv
wolverinexmen )) wolv
wolverine (( wolverinexmen )) wolv
perl )) pe
