You are given
N sets of integers
A
1
,A

,…,A
N
. For each valid
i, let's denote the elements of the set
A
i
by
{c
i,1
,c
i,2
,…,c
i,∣A
i
∣
}.
Find the number of ways to choose a sequence
(a

,a
2
,…,a
N
) such that:
a

Since this number may be large, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains an integer
∣A
i
∣ followed by a space and
∣A
i
∣ space-separated non-negative integers
c

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to choose
(a

,…,a
N
), modulo
998,244,353.
