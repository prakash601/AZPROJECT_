"Nine is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting". Hence many people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively.
A car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not good.
Why is 9099 good?
9+0+9+9 = 27
2+7 = 9
Similarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 6669, 9999â€¦ are good."
Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.
Note:
The zeros at the starting of the number are to be accounted for, i.e. 018 and 18 are different numbers.
Input
First line of the input contains T (T <= 200) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a non-empty single string S. S contains only digits i.e. from [0-9]. Length of S <= 10000.

<p>
    For each case print how many subsequences of the string result in <b>good</b> car registration numbers. As the answer can be quite large print it modulo <b>1000000007</b>.
