You are given a sequence of N integer numbers A. Calculate the sum of Ai AND Aj for all the pairs (i, j) where i < j.
The AND operation is the Bitwise AND operation, defined as in here.
Input
The first line of input consists of the integer N.
The second line contains N integer numbers - the sequence A.
Output
Output the answer to the problem on the first line of the output.
Scoring
Subtask 1 (13 points): N <= 1000, Ai <= 1.
Subtask 2 (39 points): N <= 1000, Ai <= 109.
Subtask 3 (21 points): N <= 105, Ai <= 1.
Subtask 4 (27 points): N <= 105, Ai <= 106.
