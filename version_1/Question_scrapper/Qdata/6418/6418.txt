This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that, in this version,
K
i
≤10
18
.
There’s a tree having
N nodes, out of which, some nodes are energetic.
Initially, energy of all the nodes is
0. In the
i
th
second, every energetic node will make the energy of itself and all its neighbours increase by
i.
You need to answer
Q queries. For the
i
th
query, you are given three integers:
X
i
T
i
K
i
: Find the minimum number of seconds after which, there are at least
T
i
nodes with energy not less than
K
i
on the path from node
1 to node
X
i
. If it is not possible to have at least
T
i
nodes with energy not less than
K
i
on the path from node
1 to node
X
i
after any amount of time, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
N — the number of nodes.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers, the array
A denoting whether the nodes are energetic. If
A
i
=1, it means that the
i
th
node is energetic, otherwise the
i
th
node is not energetic.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges. The
i
th
of these
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
U
i
and
V
i
, denoting an edge between
U
i
and
V
i
.
The next line contains an integer
Q — the number of queries.
The next
Q lines contain three space-separated integers
X
i
,T
i
,K
i
, the query.
Output Format
For each query, output on a new line: the minimum number of seconds after which, there are at least
T
i
nodes with energy not less than
K
i
on the path from node
1 to node
X
i
.
If it is not possible to have at least
T
i
nodes with energy not less than
K
i
on the path from node
1 to node
X
i
after any amount of time, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Query
1: No matter how long, there will not be at least
3 nodes having energy not less than
1 on the path from node
1 to node
7. Thus, the answer is
−1.
Query
2: In the
1
st
second, the energy of nodes
1,3, and
6 becomes
2,3, and
2 respectively. Thus, there are at least
3 nodes with energy not less than
2.
Query
3: In the
2
nd
second, the energy of nodes
1,4, and
7 becomes
6,3, and
0 respectively. Thus, there are at least
2 nodes with energy not less than
3.
Query
4: In the
3
rd
second, the energy of nodes
1,3, and
5 is
12,18, and
6 respectively. Thus, there are at least
3 nodes with energy not less than
5.
