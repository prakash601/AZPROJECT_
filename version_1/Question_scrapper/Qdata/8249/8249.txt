The hero is addicted to glory, and is fighting against a monster.
The hero has
n
skills. The
i
-th skill is of type
ai
(either fire or frost) and has initial damage
bi
.
The hero can perform all of the
n
skills in any order (with each skill performed exactly once). When performing each skill, the hero can play a magic as follows:
If the current skill immediately follows another skill of a different type, then its damage is doubled.
In other words,
If a skill of type fire and with initial damage
c
is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal
c
damage;
If a skill of type fire and with initial damage
c
is performed immediately after a skill of type frost, then it will deal
2c
damage;
If a skill of type frost and with initial damage
c
is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal
2c
damage;
If a skill of type frost and with initial damage
c
is performed immediately after a skill of type frost , then it will deal
c
damage.
Your task is to find the maximum damage the hero can deal.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
), indicating the number of skills.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤1
), where
ai
indicates the type of the
i
-th skill. Specifically, the
i
-th skill is of type fire if
ai=0
, and of type frost if
ai=1
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤109
), where
bi
indicates the initial damage of the
i
-th skill.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, output the maximum damage the hero can deal.

Note
In the first test case, we can order the skills by
[3,1,4,2]
, and the total damage is
100+2×1+2×1000+10=2112
.
In the second test case, we can order the skills by
[1,4,2,5,3,6]
, and the total damage is
3+2×6+2×4+2×7+2×5+2×8=63
.
In the third test case, we can order the skills by
[1,2,3]
, and the total damage is
1000000000+1000000000+1000000000=3000000000
.
In the fourth test case, there is only one skill with initial damage
1
, so the total damage is
1
.
