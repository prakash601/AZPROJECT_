Given four different points in space. Find whether these points can form a square or not.
  Example 1:
Input:
x1 = 20, y1 = 10, x2 = 10, y2 = 20, 
x3 = 20, y3 = 20, x4 = 10, y4 = 10 
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
The points (20,10), (10,20), (20,20),
(10,10) forms a square.
Example 2:
Input:
x1 = 2, y1 = 1, x2 = 10, y2 = 20, 
x3 = 5, y3 = 6, x4 = 10, y4 = 10 
Output:
No
Explanation:
The points (2,1), (10,20), (5,6),
(10,10) doesn't form a square.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isSquare() which takes 8 Integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 as input and returns whether these points form a square.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
-103 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 ≤ 103
