Let's assume that
v(n) is the largest prime number, that does not exceed n;
u(n) is the smallest prime number strictly greater than n.
Find .
Input
The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of testscases.
Each of the following t lines of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 109).
Output
Print t lines: the i-th of them must contain the answer to the i-th test as an irreducible fraction "p/q", where p, q are integers, q > 0.
