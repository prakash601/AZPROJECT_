There are three distinct points -
A,B,C in the
X−Y plane. Initially, you are located at point
A. You want to reach the point
C satisfying the following conditions:
You have to go through point B.
You can move in any of the four axis-parallel directions (
+X,
−X,
+Y,
−Y direction). However, you can make at most one turn in the path from
A to
C.
Determine if it is possible to reach the destination
C satisfying the above conditions.
NOTE:
One turn means
90
∘
clockwise or anticlockwise rotation along the direction of movement. For example, if you are moving towards the
+X direction, after one turn you can move either in the
+Y direction or in the
−Y direction. Changing the direction by
180
∘
is not allowed.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
X

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one string - "YES"(without quotes) if it is possible to reach the finishing point satisfying the above conditions, otherwise print "NO"(without quotes).

Explanation:
Test case
1: You start moving in the
+Y direction from
A=(1,1), after two-unit steps you reach the point
B=(1,3). Then you make a clockwise turn at point
B and start moving towards the
+X direction. After two-unit steps, you reach the finishing point
C=(3,3).
Test case
2: There is no possible way to reach the finishing point
C satisfying the above conditions. You have to make at least two turns in the path.
Test case
3: You start moving in the
−X direction from
A=(5,2) . After 4 unit steps, you reach the finish point
C=(1,2). In the path from
A to
C, you go through the point
B=(3,2) and don't make any turn.
