Chef has a string
S with length
N. He also has
M other strings
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
M
, which are called patterns. The characters in the strings are indexed from
1.
Chef was wondering if he could find the
M patterns in the string
S in the given order. That is, he wanted to know whether it is possible to choose
M ranges, denoted by
[l
i
,r
i
] for each
i (
1≤i≤M), such that
1≤l
1
≤r
1
<l
2
≤r
2
<…<l
M
≤r
M
≤N and for each valid
i, the substring
S
l
i
,S
l
i
+1
,…,S
r
i
equals
P
i
.
As this problem was too easy for Chef, he decided to make a harder one. A permutation
p=(p
1
,p
2
,…,p
M
) of integers
1 through
M is called a matchable permutation if Chef can reorder the
M patterns into
P
p
1
,P
p
2
,…,P
p
M
and then find them in
S, in this order (in the same way as described above).
Can you help Chef find the number of matchable permutations?
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains a single string
S.
M lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤M), the
i-th of these lines contains a single string
P
i
.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of matchable permutations.

Example Output 1
3
Explanation 1
Among the
3!=6 possible permutations of
(1,2,3), the matchable permutations are
(1,2,3),
(3,1,2) and
(1,3,2). These correspond to permutations of patterns ("ab", "ac", "b"), ("b", "ab", "ac") and ("ab", "b", "ac") respectively. Each of them can be found in
S in the given order.
Example Input 2
3 2
aaa
aa
aa
Example Output 2
0
Explanation 2
We cannot match the two patterns in such a way that their ranges do not intersect.

4 2
aaaa
aa
aa
Example Output 3
2
Explanation 3
The matchable permutations are
(1,2) and
(2,1).
