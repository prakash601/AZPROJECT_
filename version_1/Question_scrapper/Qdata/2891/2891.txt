Given an array A[]. The task is to find the maximum product possible with the subset of elements present in the array. The maximum product can be a single element also.
Since the product can be large, return it modulo (109 + 7).
Example 1:
Input:
A[] = {-1, -1, -2, 4, 3}
Output: 24
Explanation: Maximum product will be ( -2 * -1 * 4 * 3 ) = 24
Example 2:
Input:
A[] = {-1, 0}
Output: 0
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaxProduct() which takes an array of size N and returns an integer.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <= N <= 2 * 104
-10 <= A[i] <= 10
