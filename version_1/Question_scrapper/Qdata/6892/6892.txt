You are given a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You have to answer
Q queries.
In each query, you are given two integers
L and
R, and you have to find the number of ordered pairs
(X,Y) such that
L≤X,Y≤R and
A
X
≤A
X
⊕A
Y
≤A
Y
. Here,
⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,…,A
N
.
Each of the next
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
L and
R describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
