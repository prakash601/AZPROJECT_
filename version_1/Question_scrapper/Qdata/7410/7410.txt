Chef has a circular array
A of
N integers
A
1
,A
2
…A
N
where
A
N
and
A
1
are considered adjacent.
The subarray
A
i,j
defined as an array formed using elements of
A from
i
th
index element to
j
th
index element (both inclusive). Formally,
A
i,j
is defined as:
If
i≤j, then the subarray of
A from the index
i to index
j, both inclusive.
If
i>j, then it denotes the subarray of
A from index
i to index
N, followed by subarray of
A from index
1 to index
j.
A function
f(B) is defined on an array
B as the number of subarrays of
B which have sum less than
K.
Let
S=∑
N
∑
N
f(A
i,j
). Find the value of
S modulo
1,000,000,007.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
###Output: For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the value of
S modulo
1,000,000,007.

###Explanation In the second test case, the array is
[1,−1] and
K=1.
f(A
1,1
)=0
f(A
1,2
)=2, because both the subarrays
[1,−1] and
[−1] have sum
<K.
f(A
2,1
)=2, because the array we are considering now is
[−1,1], and both the subarrays
[1,−1] and
[−1] have sum
<K.
f(A
2,2
)=1
The sum of these is 5, which is the answer.
