Given two integers a and b. Find the sum of two numbers without using arithmetic operators.
Example 1:
Input:
a = 5, b = 3
Output: 8
Explanation :
5 + 3 = 8
Example 2:
Input:
a = 10, b = 30
Output: 40
Explanation:
10 + 30 = 40
Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sum() which takes two integers a and b as input and returns the sum of a and b, which is calculated without using any arithmetic operator.
  Expected Time Complexity : O(max(number of bits in 'a', number of bits in 'b'))
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)
  Constraints:
1<=a, b<=10^8
