Explanation:
Test case
1: Chefina is
10 years old when Chef is
20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be
25, Chefina would be
15.
Test case
2: Chefina is
10 years old when Chef is
20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be
36, Chefina would be
26.
Test case
3: Chefina is
10 years old when Chef is
20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be
50, Chefina would be
40.
Test case

10 years old when Chef is
20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be
44, Chefina would be
