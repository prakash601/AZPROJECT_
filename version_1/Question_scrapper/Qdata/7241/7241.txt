Chef is playing a game with two sequences of non-negative integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
. He has an integer
V, which is initially equal to
0. Chef will play for a number of turns he chooses (possibly zero); he stops playing when he gets bored. In each turn of the game, Chef must perform one of the following operations:
Choose an integer
X from
A and change
V to
V∨X, i.e. the bitwise OR of
V and
X.
Choose an integer
X from
B and change
V to
V∧X, i.e. the bitwise AND of
V and
X.
Find the number of possible distinct values which
V can have after the game ends.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

.
The third line contains
M space-separated integers
B

M
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible values of
V after the game ends.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
V can reach the values
{0,5,12,13,14,15}.
Example case 2:
V can reach the values
{0,1,3,6,7,12,13,14,15}.
Example case 3:
V can reach the values
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.
