You are given a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and an integer
M.
For any valid integers
p,q, let's define
F(p,q) as the dot product of the subsequences
A
p
,A
p+1
,…,A
p+M−1
and
A
q
,A
q+1
,…,A
q+M−1
, i.e.
F(p,q)=∑
i=0
M−1
A
p+i
⋅A
q+i
.
You should process
Q queries. In each query:
You are given two integers
pos and
val. Change the value of
A
pos
to
val.
Then, find the sum
S=∑
i=1
N−M+1
∑
j=1
N−M+1
F(i,j). Since this sum could be very large, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
Q.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers representing
A
1
,A
2
,...A
N
.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
pos and
val describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer
S modulo
998,244,353.
