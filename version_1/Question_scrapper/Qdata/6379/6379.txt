Given two numbers
l and
r, count the number of non-negative integers
x such that there exists a pair of integers
(a,b) that satisfy the following requirements:
x=a⊕b=a+b
l≤a≤b≤r.
Here
⊕ refers to the bitwise operation of XOR.
Note: You should output the number of
x. Not the number of pairs
(a,b).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input consisting of two numbers
and
r.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of non-negative integers
x that satisfy the requirements.

Explanation:
In the first case, the only possibility is
a=2 and
b=2. But
a+b=4 and
a⊕b=0. Hence, there is no
x which satisfies the requirements, and so the answer is
0.
In the second case, we can write
3=1+2=1⊕2
5=1+4=1⊕4
6=2+4=2⊕4
7=3+4=3⊕4
It can be shown that these are the non-negative integers which satisfy the requirements. Hence the total number of
x which satisfies the requirements is
4.
