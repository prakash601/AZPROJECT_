There are
N players participating in a knockout tournament. The
i-th player has the rating
A
i
. No two players have the same rating.
N−1 matches are played in the tournament. In each match,
2 random players are chosen out of the remaining players, and the player with the higher rating wins. The losing player gets eliminated from the tournament.
Can you find out the expected rating of the player ending up at the second position (that is, the expected rating of the player losing in the
(N−1)-th match)?
The expected rating of the second player can be represented as a fraction of the form
Q
P
. You are required to print
P⋅Q
−1
(mod1000000007).
Input Format
The first line contains
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the number of players participating in the tournament.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

- the ratings of the players.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the expected rating of the second player modulo
1000000007.
