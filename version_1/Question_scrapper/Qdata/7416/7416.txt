MoEngage gives you an array
A of length
N.
You are required to perform exactly
(N−1) operations on the array. In one operation, you have to pick two indices
i and
j
(1≤i<j≤N) and do the following:
Remove the elements
A
i
and
A
j
from array.
Append
∣A
i
−A
j
∣ to the array.
Note that, after each operation, the size of the array is reduced by one. Thus, after
(N−1) operations, only one element remains in the array.
Find the number of distinct values the remaining element can have after
(N−1) operations.
Input Format
First line of the input contains
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer
N denoting the length of the array.
Second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers describing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, print the number of distinct values the remaining element can have after
(N−1) operations.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The given array is
[4,8,5]. There are two possible values the remaining element can have after all the operations. These values are
1 and
7.
To get
1, we first choose
i=1 and
j=2. We remove the elements
4 and
8 and append
∣4−8∣=4 to the array. After performing the operation,
A=[5,4]. Next, we choose
i=1 and
j=2. After performing the operation,
A=[1].
To get
7, we first choose
i=1 and
j=3. We remove the elements
4 and
5 and append
∣4−5∣=1 to the array. After performing the operation,
A=[8,1]. Next, we choose
i=1 and
j=2. After performing the operation,
A=[7].
Test Case
2 : The given array is
[1]. No operations are possible in the array. So, the only possible value of the remaining element is
1.
Test Case
3 : The given array is
[2,4]. The only possible value of the remaining element after performing one operation is
2.
