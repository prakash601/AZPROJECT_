You are given
N sequences
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
. Each of them is a permutation of numbers
1 through
M.
Let's define a product of two permutations
X and
Y of numbers
1 through
M as a permutation
Z=X⋅Y such that
Z
i
=Y
X
i
for each valid
i.
You should answer
Q queries. Each query is described by two numbers
L and
R. Let's define a permutation
B=P
L
⋅P
L+1
⋅…⋅P
R
; the multiplication of permutations is evaluated left to right, i.e. as
((P
L
⋅P
L+1
)⋅…)⋅P
R
. The answer to a query is
∑
i=1
M
i⋅B
i
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers
P
i,1
,P
i,2
,…,P
i,M
denoting the permutation
P
i
.
The next line contains a single integer
Q.
Each of the following
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
L and
R describing one query.
Output
For each test case, print
Q lines. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain a single integer — the answer to the
i-th query.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
query 1:
B=[3,2,1], so the answer is
1⋅3+2⋅2+3⋅1=10
query 2:
B=[3,1,2], the answer is
11
query 3:
B=[2,3,1], the answer is
11
query 4:
B=[1,2,3], the answer is
14
query 5:
B=[2,3,1], the answer is
11
