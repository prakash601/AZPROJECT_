Chef has a binary strings
S of length
N, and an integer
K.
Hitesh wants to maximize the decimal representation of
S using
K operations of the following type:
Type
1: Insert
0 at any position in the string.
Type
2: Change any
0 to
1.
Help Hitesh find the modified string with maximum possible decimal representation after performing at most
K operations.
Note that the decimal representation of a binary string refers to the numeric value it represents when converted to the decimal number system. For instance, the decimal representation of
101 will be
5
(2
2
+2
0
), and that of
000110 will be
6
(2
2
+2
1
)
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
The second line contains the string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the modified string with maximum possible decimal representation after performing at most
K operations.
Constraints

S consists of
0 and
1 only.
The sum of
N and
K over all test cases won't exceed
5⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: We are allowed to perform two operations. We can perform both operations of type
1 to obtain
110100, having decimal value
52.
Test case
2: We are allowed to perform three operations. We can perform two operations of type
1 to obtain
00111000, and one operation of type
2 to obtain
10111000, having decimal value
184.
