Apple considers any iPhone with a battery health of
80% or above, to be in optimal condition.
Given that your iPhone has
X% battery health, find whether it is in optimal condition.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
X — the battery health.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the battery is in optimal condition, and NO otherwise.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, NO, no, No and nO, are all considered identical.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
0≤X≤100

YES
NO
Explanation:
Test case
1: The battery health is
97% which is greater than equal to
80%. Thus, the battery is in optimal condition.
Test case
2: The battery health is
42% which is less than
80%. Thus, the battery is not in optimal condition.
Test case
3: The battery health is
80% which is greater than equal to
80%. Thus, the battery is in optimal condition.
Test case
4: The battery health is
10% which is less than
80%. Thus, the battery is not in optimal condition.
