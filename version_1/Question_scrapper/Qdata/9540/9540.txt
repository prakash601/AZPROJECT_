There are
n
cities numbered from
1
to
n
, and city
i
has beauty
ai
.
A salesman wants to start at city
1
, visit every city exactly once, and return to city
1
.
For all
i≠j
, a flight from city
i
to city
j
costs
max(ci,aj−ai)
dollars, where
ci
is the price floor enforced by city
i
. Note that there is no absolute value. Find the minimum total cost for the salesman to complete his trip.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
) — the number of cities.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
ai
,
ci
(
0≤ai,ci≤109
) — the beauty and price floor of the
i
-th city.
Output
Output a single integer — the minimum total cost.

Note
In the first test case, we can travel in order
1→3→2→1
.
The flight
1→3
costs
max(c1,a3−a1)=max(9,4−1)=9
.
The flight
3→2
costs
max(c3,a2−a3)=max(1,2−4)=1
.
The flight
2→1
costs
max(c2,a1−a2)=max(1,1−2)=1
.
The total cost is
11
, and we cannot do better.
