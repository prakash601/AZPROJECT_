Logical operators are used when we want to check the truth value of certain statements. Logical operators help us in checking multiple statements together for their truthness.
Here we will learn logical operators like AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!). These operators produce either a true or a false as an output.
Example 1:
Input:
true false
Output:
false true false
Explanation:
true&&false=>false
true||false=>true
!(true) && !(false)=>false

Example 2:
Input:
true true
Output:
true true false
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function logicOp() which takes a and b as a parameter and prints (a AND b), (a OR b), (a NOT b) in separated by space. 

Note:- Don't print result with New Line, it will be handled by the driver.

Constraints:
a, b = {true, false}
