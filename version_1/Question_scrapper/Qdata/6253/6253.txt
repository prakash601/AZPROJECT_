Given an array
A of length
N.
You are allowed to perform the following operation on the array
A atmost
20 times:
Select a non-empty subsequence
S of the array
[1,2,3,…,N] and an integer
X
(0≤X≤10
6
);
Change
A
i
to
A
i
+X for all
i∈S.
You have to sort the array
A in strictly increasing order by performing atmost
20 operations.
It is guaranteed that we can always sort the array
A under given constraints.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the initial array
A.
Output Format
For each test case print
(2⋅Q+1) lines. Here
Q denotes the number of operations you performed to sort the array
A. Note that,
Q must be less than or equal to
20. For each test case,
In the first line, print
Q, the number of operations you perform.
Then, print
2⋅Q lines. The
(2⋅i−1)
th
and
(2⋅i)
th
of these lines denote the
i
th
(1≤i≤Q) operation.
To describe the
i
th
operation, print two space-separated integers
K
i
(1≤K
i
≤N) and
X
i
(0≤X
i
≤10
6
) on
(2⋅i−1)
th
line and print
K
i
space-separated integers describing subsequence
S
i
on
(2⋅i)
th
line.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can sort the array using
2 operations:
First operation: Choose
S=[2] and
X=1. Thus, we perform
A
2
=A
2
+1. The array becomes
[4,5,4].
Second operation: Choose
S=[3] and
X=2. Thus, we perform
A
3
=A
3
+2. The final array is
[4,5,6].
The array is now sorted in strictly increasing order.
Test case
2: We can sort the array using
4 operations:
First operation: Choose
S=[2] and
X=20. Thus, we perform
A
2
=A
2
+20. The array becomes
[8,28,5,2,1].
Second operation: Choose
S=[3] and
X=30. Thus, we perform
A
3
=A
3
+30. The array becomes
[8,28,35,2,1].
Third operation: Choose
S=[4] and
X=40. Thus, we perform
A
4
=A
4
+40. The array becomes
[8,28,35,42,1].
Fourth operation: Choose
S=[5] and
X=50. Thus, we perform
A
5
=A
5
+50. The final array is
[8,28,35,42,51].
The array is now sorted in strictly increasing order.
Test case
3: The array is already sorted. Thus, we require
0 operation.
