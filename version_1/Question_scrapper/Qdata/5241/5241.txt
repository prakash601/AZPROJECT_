There is a secret sequence
A

N
. We do not know the elements of this sequence, but we know another sequence
B

,…,B
N−1
such that
B

i
+A
i+1
for each valid
i.
You should process
Q queries. In each query, you are given two indices
p and
q; your task is to compute
A
p
+A
q
or determine that there is not enough information to uniquely determine this sum.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
B

,B

,…,B
N−1
.
Each of the following
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
p and
q describing a query.
Output
For each query, if it is impossible to determine the required sum, print a single line containing the string "UNKNOWN". Otherwise, print a single line containing one integer — the required sum.
