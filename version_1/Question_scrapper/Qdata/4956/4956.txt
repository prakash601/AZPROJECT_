You are given an integer
n and a string
s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'. Consider a string
t=
n times
s+s+⋯+s
, i.e. the string obtained by concatenating
n copies of
s.
Find the number of non-empty prefixes of
t in which the number of occurrences of 'a' is strictly greater than the number of occurrences of 'b'.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains the string
s and the integer
n, separated by a single space.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid prefixes.
Constraints

Explanation:
Example case 1: The string
t is "abaaba". It has five prefixes which contain more a-s than b-s: "a", "aba", "abaa", "abaab" and "abaaba".
Example case 2: The string
t is "baabaabaa". The strings "baa", "baaba", "baabaa", "baabaab", "baabaaba" and "baabaabaa" are the six valid prefixes.
Example case 3: The string
t is "bbabbabba". There is no prefix of this string which consists of more a-s than b-s. Therefore, the answer is zero.
