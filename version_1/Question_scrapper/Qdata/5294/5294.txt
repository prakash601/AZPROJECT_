Dr.D got so famous thanks to his first problem that he decided to commemorate it by making yet another problem with an almost identical statement — he only changed one word.
We want to choose exactly two integers (not necessarily distinct) from the interval
[L,R]. Find the maximum possible value of the bitwise OR of the chosen integers.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L,
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum bitwise OR.
