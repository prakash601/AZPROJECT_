Given a positive integer n, Chef has asked you to calculate the following sum in the most efficient way:
Here gcd(a,b) means greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line describing each test case contains a single integer , given to you by Chef.
Please note that input can be very large. So it's recommended to use fast IO methods.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer: answer to Chef's query.
Constraints and Subtasks
1 ≤ T ≤ 106
1 ≤ n ≤ 107

Subtask1(10 points): 1 ≤ sum of n over all testcases ≤ 107, TL=1.5s
Subtask2(20 points): 1 ≤ n ≤ 104, TL=1s
Subtask3(70 points): No additional constraints, TL=1s
