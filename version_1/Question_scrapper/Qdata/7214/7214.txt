The median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted. For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence
A=[1,3,3,5,4,7,11], the median is equal to
4, and for
A=[2,3,4,5], the median is equal to
(3+4)/2=3.5.
Fulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence
A with length
N:
read(N)
read(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])
sort(A)
# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the array A
# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged
remove(A[K], A[N mod K])
return A[(N-2)/2] # integer division
The program takes an integer
K as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between
1 and
N−1 inclusive.
Little Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence
A=[34,23,35,514], which is a counterexample for any
K≤3), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters
S,K,m,M (in addition to
N) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest proper sequence
A with length
N as a counterexample.
We say that a sequence
A with length
N (
0-indexed) is proper if it satisfies the following conditions:
it contains only positive integers
A
0
+A
1
+A
2
+⋯+A
N−1
=S
m≤A
i
≤M for each
0≤i<N
the number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter
K, is different from the correct median of the sequence
A
Can you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers
N,
S,
K,
m and
M.
Output
For each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer
−1; otherwise, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers — the lexicographically smallest proper sequence.

Explanation:
Example case 1: For the sequence
A=[1,1,4], it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements (
K=1,
N%K=0) and return the only remaining element
4. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is
1. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence.
Example case 2: The only possible sequence is
A=[1,1,1,1], which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer
1 for it.
