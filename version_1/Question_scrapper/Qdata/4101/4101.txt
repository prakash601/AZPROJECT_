Kulyash is given an integer
N. His task is to break
N into some number of (integer) powers of
2.
TO achieve this, he can perform the following operation several times (possibly, zero):
Choose an integer
X which he already has, and break
X into
2 integer parts (
Y and
Z) such that
X=Y+Z.
Find the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to accomplish his task.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
N — the original integer with Kulyash.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to break
N into powers of
2.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
3 can be broken into
2 and
1 (both are powers of
2) by using
1 operation.
Test case
2:
4 is already a power of
2 so there is no need to perform any operations.
