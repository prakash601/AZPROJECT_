 Given a Binary Search Tree. Find sum of all elements smaller than and equal to Kth smallest element.
Example 1:
Input: 
 20
 / \
 8 22
 / \
 4 12
 / \
 10 14 , K=3

Output: 22
Explanation:
Sum of 3 smallest elements are: 
4 + 8 + 10 = 22
Input:
 10
  / \
  5 11
  / \ 
 4 7
  \
  8 , K=2

Output: 9
Explanation:
The sum of two smallest elements 
is 4+5=9.
  Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sum() which takes the root node and an integer K as input parameters and returns the sum of all elements smaller than and equal to kth smallest element.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(K)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1<=Number of nodes in BST<=100
1<=K<=N
