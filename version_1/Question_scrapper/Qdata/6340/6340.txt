In a country Stone Land, there are
N stones arranged in a row from left to right. Each stone has some height represented by a positive number. The stones are numbered from
1 to
N from left to right.
You are given an array H of size
N consisting of the height of the
N stones from left to right.
Stone at
j
th
position is visible from the stone at
i
th
position if:-
j>i
max(H[i],H[i+1],H[i+2],....,H[j−1])
<
H[j]
You are asked
M queries.
Each query consists of two different positions of stones
A and
B.
You have to Print the total number of stones that are visible from both the stones at the position
A and
B.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M, where
N is the number of stones and
M is the number of queries.
The Second line consists of
N space-separated integers (array H) denoting the height of stones from left to the right separated by a space.
Next,
M lines consist of two space-separated integers
A and
B separated by space where
A and
B are positions of stones.

Output
For each query, print the total number of stones that are visible from both the stones at the position
A and
B in a new line.

Explanation
Query
1: Stone at position
1 can see the stones at position
(2,3,6) whereas stone at position
2 can see the stones at position
(3,6). Thus, the total number of stones that are visible from both stones is
2.
