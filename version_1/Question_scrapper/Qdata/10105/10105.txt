You are given
n
segments
[l1,r1],[l2,r2],…,[ln,rn]
. Each segment has one of two colors: the
i
-th segment's color is
ti
.
Let's call a pair of segments
i
and
j
bad if the following two conditions are met:
ti≠tj
;
the segments
[li,ri]
and
[lj,rj]
intersect, embed or touch, i. e. there exists an integer
x
such that
x∈[li,ri]
and
x∈[lj,rj]
.
Calculate the maximum number of segments that can be selected from the given ones, so that there is no bad pair among the selected ones.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — number of segments.
The next
n
lines contains three integers
li,ri,ti
(
1≤li≤ri≤109;ti∈{1,2}
) — description of the
i
-th segment.
Output
Print the maximum number of segments that can be selected, so that there is no bad pair among the selected segments.
