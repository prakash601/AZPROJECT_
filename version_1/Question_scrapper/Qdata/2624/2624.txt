Calculate the angle between the hour hand and minute hand.
Note: There can be two angles between hands; we need to print a minimum of two. Also, we need to print the floor of the final result angle. For example, if the final angle is 10.61, we need to print 10.

Example 1:
Input:
H = 9 , M = 0
Output:
90
Explanation:
The minimum angle between hour and minute
hand when the time is 9 is 90 degress.
Example 2:
Output:
75
Explanation:
The minimum angle between hour and minute
hand when the time is 3:30 is 75 degress.

Your Task:
You don't need to read, input, or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getAngle(), which takes 2 Integers H and M as input and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ H ≤ 12
0 ≤ M < 60
H and M are Integers
