Given 2 arrays A, B (1-indexed) each having length N. There are 2 types of queries. You have to handle Q of them.
Type 1 : 1 L
Add the subarray B1, B2, B3 ... BN-L+1 to AL, AL+1, AL+2 ... AN respectively.
i.e. Add B1 to AL, B2 to AL+1 ... BN-L+1 to AN.

Type 2 : 2 L R
Print the sum AL + AL+1 + AL+2 + ... AR
Input Format:
First line of the input contains two space separated integer denoting N, Q respectively.
Next 2 lines of the input, each containing space separating integers, denotes array A and array B respectively. Next Q lines describes a query. Each query starts with a integer t, denoting the type of query and contains one or two integer depending on type of query as described in the problem statement.
Output Format:
For each query of type 2 print the answer.
Constraints:
1<= N <=200000
1<= Q <=200000
1<= Ai <=100000
1<= Bi <=100000
1<= t <=2
For type 1 query, 1 <= L <= N
For type 2 query, 1 <= L <= R <= N
Sample Input:
4 3
1 2 1 4
2 1 2 3
1 2
2 1 1
2 2 4
Sample Output:
