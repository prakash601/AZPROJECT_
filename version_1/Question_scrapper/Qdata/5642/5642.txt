You have
N rods with you. The
i-th rod has a length of
A
i
and a beauty of
B
i
.
You'd like to arrange these rods side-by-side in some order on the number line, starting from
0.
Let
x
i
be the starting position of the
i-th rod in an arrangement. The beauty of this arrangement is
i=1
∑
N
x

What is the maximum beauty you can attain?
Note that the left endpoint of the first rod you place must be
0, and you cannot leave any space between rods.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of rods.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: Place the second rod followed by the first one. This makes
x
2
=0 and
x
1
=2, giving us a beauty of
2⋅4+0⋅6=8, which is the maximum possible.
Test case
2: Place the rods in the order
[2,4,3,1]. This gives us
x=[28,0,19,8], and the beauty is
28⋅25+0⋅27+19⋅100+8⋅45=2960.
