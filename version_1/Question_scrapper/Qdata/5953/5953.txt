Given an array
A with
N positive integers -
(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
).
A partition of the array into subarrays refers to dividing the entire array into subarrays (ie. some continuous elements) such that each of the
N elements is in exactly one subarray.
We call a partition of the array into subarrays as Valid, if this condition holds true: For all
i, if
i and
i+1 are in the same subarray then
A
i+1
must be divisible by
A
i
.
Now, among all such Valid partitions, we are interested in the partition with the minimum number of subarrays. It can be proved that there is a unique such partition. We will be interested only with this partition in the problem.
We call
S
i
the index of the subarray in which element
i lies.
We now want to support some operations on the array. In particular, there are
Q operations of the form -
1
i
X - Change
A
i
to
X
2
i - Given
i , output the smallest
j such that
S
i
=S
j
. That is, the leftmost index which belongs to the same subarray as the i-th element.
###Input:
First line will contain
N and
Q denoting the size of
A and number of operations respectively.
The second line contains
N values, the initial values of
A.
The next
Q lines contain the operations as stated above.
###Output:
The answer for each query of type 2 on a new line.

###Explanation: Initially,
A=[2,2,7,14,14] and
S=[1,1,2,2,2] (
A
2
is divisible by
A
1
,
A
3
is not divisible by
A
2
,
A
4
is divisible by
A
3
,
A
5
is divisible by
A
4
)
After the first operation
A=[3,2,7,14,14] and
S=[1,2,3,3,3] (
A
1
is 3 now and
A
2
modA
1

=0 now)
After the second operation
A=[3,6,7,14,14] and
S=[1,1,2,2,2] (
A
2
is 6 now and
A
2
is divisible by
A
1
once again)
For the queries, we can look at the
S
i
value for the given index and find the smallest index with the same value. Note here that the exact value of
S
i
is irrelevant. We just want the first element of the same chain.
