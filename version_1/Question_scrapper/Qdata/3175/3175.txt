Given a string s which contains only lower alphabetic characters, check if it is possible to remove at most one character from this string in such a way that frequency of each distinct character becomes same in the string.
Example 1:
Input:
s = xyyz
Output: 1 
Explanation: Removing one 'y' will make 
frequency of each letter 1.

Example 2:
Input:
s = xxxxyyzz
Output: 0
 Frequency can not be made same 
same by removing just 1 character.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function sameFreq() which takes a string as input parameter and returns a boolean value denoting if same frequency is possible or not.
Note: The driver code print 1 if the value returned is true, otherwise 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N) where N is length of str
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= str.length() <= 104
