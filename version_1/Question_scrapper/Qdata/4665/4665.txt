It's well known that our friend Balsa likes the digit
3 very much. He's so obsessed with this digit that he spends time thinking about it even during holidays.
Today, Balsa invented an interesting problem: For a positive integer
N, find the smallest integer greater than
N such that its decimal representation contains the digit
3 at least three times.
You are given the integer
N. Please solve this problem for Balsa.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest number greater than
N containing the digit
3 at least three times.
