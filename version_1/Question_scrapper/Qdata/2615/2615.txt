Complete the function to find spiral order traversal of a tree. For below tree, function should return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.


 
  Example 1:
Input:
      1
    /   \
   3     2
Output:1 3 2
Example 2:
Input:
           10
         /     \
        20     30
      /    \
    40     60
Output: 10 20 30 60 40 
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function findSpiral() which takes root node as input parameter and returns the elements in spiral form of level order traversal as a list. The newline is automatically appended by the driver code.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Constraints:
0 <= Number of nodes <= 105
0 <= Data of a node <= 105
