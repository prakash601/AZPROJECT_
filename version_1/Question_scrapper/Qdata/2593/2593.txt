Given a Binary Number B, find its decimal equivalent.
  Example 1:
Input: B = 10001000
Output: 136
Example 2:
Input: B = 101100
Output: 44
  Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function binary_to_decimal() which takes the binary number as string input parameter and returns its decimal equivalent.
  O(K * Log(K)) where K is number of bits in binary number.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <= number of bits in binary number  <= 16
