There are
N people standing in a line from left to right. The
i-th person from the left has a height
H
i
.
H is a permutation of
1 to
N.
First, you must assign each of them a shirt with the letter
L or
R on it. Then you may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose a person with
L on their shirt and move them to the left end of the line.
Choose a person with
R on their shirt and move them to the right end of the line.
For example, if
H=[4,1,2,3] and we assign the shirts to the people as
[(4,R),(1,L),(2,L),(3,R)], then if we move person
1 to the right end of the line the arrangement of people becomes
[(1,L),(2,L),(3,R),(4,R)]
An assignment of shirts is called good if it is possible to sort the people in the line in non-decreasing order of height from left to right by using this operation zero or more times.
How many good assignments of shirts exist? Since this number may be large, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
One assignment of shirts is different from another assignment if there exists at least one person who is assigned a shirt with a different letter on it.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N - the number of people.
The second line contains

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of good assignments of shirts modulo

Explanation:
Test case 1:
For the assignment
[L,L], we can sort the line in non-decreasing order by moving person
2 to the left end of the line.
For the assignment
[R,R], we can sort the line in non-decreasing order by moving person
1 to the right end of the line.
For the assignment
[R,L], we can sort the line in non-decreasing order by moving person
1 to the right end of the line or by moving person
2 to the left end of the line.
For the assignment
[L,R], all possible operations don't change the order of people in the line. So it is impossible to sort line in non-descending order of height.
Test case 2: A line with a single person is always sorted in non-decreasing order regardless of the operations performed, so both possible assignments of shirts are valid.
Test case 3: For any assignment of shirts, we can sort the line in non-descending order by performing zero operations as the line is already sorted in non-decreasing order. So all
2
5
=32 assignments of shirts are valid.
Test case 4: The
7 good assignments of shirts are:
LLLL
LRLL
LLRL
LRRL
RRRL
LRRR
RRRR
