Little penguin Polo likes permutations. But most of all he likes permutations of integers from 0 to n, inclusive.
For permutation p = p0, p1, ..., pn, Polo has defined its beauty — number .
Expression means applying the operation of bitwise excluding "OR" to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in language C++ and Java it is represented as "^" and in Pascal — as "xor".
Help him find among all permutations of integers from 0 to n the permutation with the maximum beauty.
Input
The single line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106).
Output
In the first line print integer m the maximum possible beauty. In the second line print any permutation of integers from 0 to n with the beauty equal to m.
If there are several suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them.
