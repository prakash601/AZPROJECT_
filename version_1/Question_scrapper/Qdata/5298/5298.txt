Given a set of N integer points on the Cartesian plane. Your task is to find an integer point satisfying its sum of distances to N given points (S) is minimum.
Input
There are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:
The first line contains a positive integer N (N â‰¤ 2,000).
N lines follow, each containing a pair of integers (each having an absolute value of 109 at most) describing coordinates of a given point.
The input is ended with N = 0.
Output
For each test case, output on a line a real number (with exactly 6 decimal places) which is the respective minimum sum S found.
