Explanation:
Test case
1: The total income is
50×2=100 coins. The juicer spends
20 coins on sugarcane,
20 coins on salt and mint leaves and
30 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is
100−(20+20+30)=30 coins.
Test case
2: The total income is
50×4=200 coins. The juicer spends
40 coins on sugarcane,
40 coins on salt and mint leaves and
60 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is
200−(40+40+60)=60 coins.
Test case
3: The total income is
50×5=250 coins. The juicer spends
50 coins on sugarcane,
50 coins on salt and mint leaves and
75 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is
250−(50+50+75)=75 coins.
Test case
4: The total income is
50×10=500 coins. The juicer spends
100 coins on sugarcane,
100 coins on salt and mint leaves and
150 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is
500−(100+100+150)=150 coins.
