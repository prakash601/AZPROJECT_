Vasya has written some permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
of integers from
1
to
n
, so for all
1≤i≤n
it is true that
1≤pi≤n
and all
p1,p2,…,pn
are different. After that he wrote
n
numbers
next1,next2,…,nextn
. The number
nexti
is equal to the minimal index
i<j≤n
, such that
pj>pi
. If there is no such
j
let's let's define as
nexti=n+1
.
In the evening Vasya went home from school and due to rain, his notebook got wet. Now it is impossible to read some written numbers. Permutation and some values
nexti
are completely lost! If for some
i
the value
nexti
is lost, let's say that
nexti=−1
.
You are given numbers
next1,next2,…,nextn
(maybe some of them are equal to
−1
). Help Vasya to find such permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
of integers from
1
to
n
, that he can write it to the notebook and all numbers
nexti
, which are not equal to
−1
, will be correct.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
 — the number of test cases (
1≤t≤100000
).
Next
2⋅t
lines contains the description of test cases,two lines for each. The first line contains one integer
n
 — the length of the permutation, written by Vasya (
1≤n≤500000
). The second line contains
n
integers
next1,next2,…,nextn
, separated by spaces (
nexti=−1
or
i<nexti≤n+1
).
It is guaranteed, that the sum of
n
in all test cases doesn't exceed
500000
.
In hacks you can only use one test case, so
T=1
.
Output
Print
T
lines, in
i
-th of them answer to the
i
-th test case.
If there is no such permutations
p1,p2,…,pn
of integers from
1
to
n
, that Vasya could write, print the only number
−1
.
In the other case print
n
different integers
p1,p2,…,pn
, separated by spaces (
1≤pi≤n
). All defined values of
nexti
which are not equal to
−1
should be computed correctly
p1,p2,…,pn
using defenition given in the statement of the problem. If there exists more than one solution you can find any of them.

Note
In the first test case for permutation
p=[1,2,3]
Vasya should write
next=[2,3,4]
, because each number in permutation is less than next. It's easy to see, that it is the only satisfying permutation.
In the third test case, any permutation can be the answer because all numbers
nexti
are lost.
In the fourth test case, there is no satisfying permutation, so the answer is
−1
.
