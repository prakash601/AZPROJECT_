A permutation of length
N is an array of
N integers
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] such that every integer from
1 to
N appears in it exactly once.
We define a function over a permutation as follows:
F(A)=(A
1
∗A
2
)+(A
2
∗A
3
)+⋯+(A
N−2
∗A
N−1
)+(A
N−1
∗A
N
)
You are given an integer
N. What is the expected value of the function
F over all possible permutations of length
N?
The expected value of the function can be represented as a fraction of the form
Q
P
. You are required to print
P⋅Q
−1
(mod1000000007).
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the expected value of the function modulo
1000000007.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: There are
2 possible permutations:
A={1,2} with
F(A)=2 and
A={2,1} with
F(A)=2. Hence the expected value of the function is
F(A)=
2

∗2+

∗2=2.
Test Case
2: There are
6 possible permutations, with the value of function as
{5,5,8,8,9,9}. Hence the expected value of the function is
F(A)=
6
5+5+8+8+9+9
=

22
. The required output will be
333333343, since
333333343⋅3≡22(mod1000000007).
