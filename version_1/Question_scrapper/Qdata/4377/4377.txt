You are given an array
A of length
N.
The interesting value of a subarray is defined as the product of the maximum and minimum elements of the subarray.
Find the minimum and maximum interesting value over all subarrays for the given array.
Note: A subarray is obtained by deletion of several (possibly zero) elements from the beginning of the array and several (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output two space-separated integers on a new line the minimum and maximum interesting value over all subarrays for the given array.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The minimum interesting value possible is
4. A subarray with interesting value equal to
4 is
[2,2]. Here, both minimum and maximum elements of the subarray are
2. It can be proven that no subarray of the array has interesting value less than
4.
The maximum interesting value possible is
4. A subarray with interesting value equal to
4 is
[2,2]. Here, both minimum and maximum elements of the subarray are
2. It can be proven that no subarray of the array has interesting value greater than
4.
Test case
2: The minimum interesting value possible is
0. A subarray with interesting value equal to
0 is
[5,0,9]. Here, minimum element is
0 and maximum element is
9. It can be proven that no subarray of the array has interesting value less than
0.
The maximum interesting value possible is
81. A subarray with interesting value equal to
81 is
[9]. Here, both minimum and maximum elements of the subarray are
9. It can be proven that no subarray of the array has interesting value more than
81.
