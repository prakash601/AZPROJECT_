There are
N cities in Chefland numbered from
1 to
N and every city has a railway station. Some cities have a train and each city has at most one train originating from it. The trains are represented by an array
A, where
A
i
=0 means the
i-th city doesn't have any train originating from it,
A
i
=1 means the train originating from the
i-th city is moving right (to a higher numbered city), and
A
i
=2 means the train originating from the
i-th city is moving left (to a lower numbered city).
Each train keeps on going forever in its direction and takes
1 minute to travel from the current station to the next one. There is a special station at city
1 which lets travellers instantaneously teleport to any other station that currently has a train. Teleportation and getting on a train once in the city both take
0 minutes and all trains start at time
0.
There are
M travellers at city
1, and the
i-th traveller has destination city
B
i
. They ask Chef to guide them to teleport to a particular station from which they can catch a train to go to their destination in the least time possible. In case it's not possible for a person to reach his destination, print
−1.
Note: The input and output of this problem are large, so prefer using fast input/output methods.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains three lines of input.

C
1
,C
2
,…,C
M
, where
C
i
is the minimum time required by the
i-th traveller to reach his destination and if the
i-th traveller can't reach his destination,
C
i
=−1.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The only person takes the train from station
1 and hence takes
∣5−1∣=4 minutes to reach his destination.
Test Case
2: The only person takes the train from station
5 and hence takes
∣5−4∣=1 minute to reach his destination.
Test Case
3: Since no train passes station
3, it's impossible for the first person to reach his destination and since the second person is already at station
1, it takes him
0 minutes to reach his destination.
