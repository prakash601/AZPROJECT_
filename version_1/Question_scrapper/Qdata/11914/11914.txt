You are given a tuple generator
f(k)=(f
(k)
1
,f
(k)
2
,…,f
(k)
n
)
, where
f
(k)
i
=(ai⋅f
(k−1)
i
+bi)modpi
and
f(0)=(x1,x2,…,xn)
. Here
xmody
denotes the remainder of
x
when divided by
y
. All
pi
are primes.
One can see that with fixed sequences
xi
,
yi
,
ai
the tuples
f(k)
starting from some index will repeat tuples with smaller indices. Calculate the maximum number of different tuples (from all
f(k)
for
k≥0
) that can be produced by this generator, if
xi
,
ai
,
bi
are integers in the range
[0,pi−1]
and can be chosen arbitrary. The answer can be large, so print the remainder it gives when divided by
109+7
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of elements in the tuple.
The second line contains
n
space separated prime numbers — the modules
p1,p2,…,pn
(
2≤pi≤2⋅106
).
Output
Print one integer — the maximum number of different tuples modulo
109+7
.

Note
In the first example we can choose next parameters:
a=[1,1,1,1]
,
b=[1,1,1,1]
,
x=[0,0,0,0]
, then
f

In the second example we can choose next parameters:
a=[1,1,2]
,
b=[1,1,0]
,
x=[0,0,1]
