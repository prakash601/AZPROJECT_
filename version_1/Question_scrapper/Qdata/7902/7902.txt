The score of a sequence
[s1,s2,…,sd]
is defined as
s1⋅s2⋅…⋅sd
d!
, where
d!=1⋅2⋅…⋅d
. In particular, the score of an empty sequence is
1
.
For a sequence
[s1,s2,…,sd]
, let
m
be the maximum score among all its subsequences. Its cost is defined as the maximum length of a subsequence with a score of
m
.
You are given a non-decreasing sequence
[a1,a2,…,an]
of integers of length
n
. In other words, the condition
a1≤a2≤…≤an
is satisfied. For each
k=1,2,…,n
, find the cost of the sequence
[a1,a2,…,ak]
.
A sequence
x
is a subsequence of a sequence
y
if
x
can be obtained from
y
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the given sequence.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — the given sequence. It is guaranteed that its elements are in non-decreasing order.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output
n
integers — the costs of sequences
[a1,a2,…,ak]
in ascending order of
k
.

Note
In the first test case:
The maximum score among the subsequences of
[1]
is
1
. The subsequences
[1]
and
[]
(the empty sequence) are the only ones with this score. Thus, the cost of
[1]
is
1
.
The maximum score among the subsequences of
[1,2]
is
2
. The only subsequence with this score is
[2]
. Thus, the cost of
[1,2]
is
1
.
The maximum score among the subsequences of
[1,2,3]
is
3
. The subsequences
[2,3]
and
[3]
are the only ones with this score. Thus, the cost of
[1,2,3]
is
2
.
Therefore, the answer to this case is
112
, which are the costs of
[1],[1,2]
and
[1,2,3]
in this order.
