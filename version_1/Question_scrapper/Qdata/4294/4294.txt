There are n villages in a line in an area. There are two kinds of tribes A and B that reside there. A village can be either empty or occupied by one of the tribes. An empty village is said to be controlled by a tribe of village A if it is surrounded by villages of tribes A from the left and from the right. Same goes for the tribe B.
Find out the number of villages that are either occupied by or controlled by tribes A and B, respectively.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Output
For each test case, output two space-separated integers denoting the number of villages either occupied by or controlled by tribe A and B, respectively.
