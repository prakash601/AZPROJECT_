After a very long time, the Chef has a vacation. Chef has planned for two trips during this vacation - one with his family and the other with his friends. The family trip will take
X days and the trip with friends will take
Y days. Currently, the dates are not decided but the vacation will last only for
Z days.
Chef can be in at most one trip at any time and once a trip is started, Chef must complete it before the vacation ends. Will Chef be able to go on both these trips if he chooses the dates optimally?
