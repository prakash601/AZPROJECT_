You're given an
N×M matrix
A, where
A
(i,j)
=i.
A mountain in the matrix is defined as a set of cells and is expressed using
K+2 integers:
P,K,L
1
,L
2
,…,L
K
.
This translates to: from the
(P+i−1)
th
row, select the first
L
i
cells
(1≤i≤K) in the row. Refer samples for more clarity.
Your task is to answer
Q queries. For the
i
th
query:
You are given an integer
S
i
and you need to find a mountain with sum
S
i
.
Input Format
The first line contains three space-separated integers
N,
M, and
Q, the dimensions of the matrix and the number of queries.
The second line contains
Q space-separated integers
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
Q
, denoting each query.
Output Format
For each query, if no possible mountain with given sum exists, output
−1.
Otherwise, output two lines:
The first line contains two space-separated integers
P,
K
(1≤P≤N,P+K−1≤N);
The second line contains
K space-separated integers
L
1
,L
2
,…,L
K
(1≤L
i
≤M).
If multiple mountains satisfy the condition, you may print any.

Explanation:
Query
1: A possible mountain that satisfies the condition is highlighted below:
Here,
P=2 and
K=3 and we are selecting
2,4, and
1 cells from the second, third, and fourth row respectively. The sum of the highlighted cells is
20.
Query
2: A possible mountain that satisfies the condition is highlighted below:
Here,
P=1 and
K=5 and we are selecting
3,1,4,1, and
3 cells from the first, second, third, fourth and fifth rows respectively. The sum of the highlighted cells is
36.
