There are
N cans lying on the X-axis at points
X
i
(1≤i≤N). Each of the N cans is associated with two values
A
i
and
B
i
. Also, the segment between the points
L and
R
(L≤R) is considered to be green zone including the points
L and
R. There are two types of operations -
1. Select a can
i out of the
N cans and move it one unit in either direction along the axis, i.e. if before the operation can is at
X
i
then after the operation, it moves to either
X
i
+1 or
X
i
−1. This costs
B
i
coins and it can be performed any number of times for each of the cans.
2. Choose any integer
k and shift the green zone to the segment between
L
′
and
R
′
, where
L
′
and
R
′
are the mirror images of points
R and
L with respect to line
X=k respectively. This operation should be performed exactly once.
After all the operations, you get number of coins equal to sum of values of
A
i
of the cans which lie in the final green zone. We define the net coins as:
Number of coins you get - Number of coins spent
Find the maximum possible net coins you can earn.

Explanation:
Test case
1 : Lets choose the axis at
X=5 and Shift the green zone in the range
[0,3], such that can lies in green zone. So, there is no need for operation of type
1 and total number of coins earned is
A
1
, i.e.
6.
Test case
2 : Choose the axis at
X=8, so the new green zone lies in the region
[6,9]. Move the can
1 to
X=6. Number of coins received is equal to
A
1
+A
2
and number of coins spent is
4⋅B
1
. So, the net coins earned is
20+6−4=22. This is also the maximum possible.
