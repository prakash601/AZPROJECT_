There is a planet named “Ruizland” having
N cities, These cities are connected in the form of a tree by a bidirectional path of specified length(in miles). Cities are numbered from
1 to
N. City number
1 is the capital city.
M pilgrims started their journey from the capital city having initial energy
E

respectively which reduces on moving from one city to another by a certain amount
(A).
A is calculated as follows:-
Consider two cities
U and
V having an edge length of
K miles. The total number of distinct cities from the capital city to the city
U is
D (city
U and capital city both are inclusive).
If a pilgrim moves from city
U to
V, then
A=K∗D.
Out of
N cities, There are some special cities (except the capital city) that are connected to only one city. All pilgrims want to reach any of the special cities. A pilgrim will stop his journey as soon as the energy of the pilgrims becomes
0 or reaches any of the special cities.
Initially, all cities have
0 pilgrims except the capital city.
Find the maximum count of special cities that is non-empty (at least one pilgrim is present) after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims given that pilgrims are allowed to take any path during their journey.
###Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
M separated by space, where
N is the number of cities and
M is the number of pilgrims.
The second line contains
M integers separated by spaces, denoting the initial energy of the pilgrims.
Next,
N−1 lines consists of three integers
U,
V and
K separated by space where city
U and
V are connected by a bidirectional path whose length is
K miles
Output
For each test case, Print the maximum count of special cities that is non-empty (at least one pilgrim is present) after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims.

Explanation:
There are
3 special cities namely
3,5 and
6. The energy expected to reach these special cities are
50,190 and
50 respectively. Special city
5 cannot be reached by any pilgrim. If Pilgrim
1 goes to the special city
3 and pilgrim
4 goes to the special city
6, then the maximum number of non-empty special cities is
2.
