We all know that Chef got a box of
N chocolates (numbered
1 through
N) as his birthday present. For each valid
i, the
i-th chocolate has a sweetness value
W
i
. Chef is going to play the following randomised game for fun with his brother:
First, an integer
k between
1 and
N (inclusive) is chosen uniformly randomly.
Then,
k times, Chef chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently (each chocolate may be chosen multiple times). For each
i (
1≤i≤k), let's denote the sweetness of the
i-th chocolate chosen by Chef by
A
.
Chef's brother does the same thing ―
k times, he also chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently from each other or Chef's choices (so each chocolate may still be chosen multiple times). For each
i (
1≤i≤k), let's denote the sweetness of the
i-th chocolate chosen by Chef's brother by
B
i
.
The score of the game is
∑
i=1
k
∑
j=1
k
gcd(A
i
,B

).
Find the expected value of the score. It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction
Q
P
, where
P and
Q are positive integers and
Q is coprime with
998,244,353. You should compute
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353, where
Q
−1
denotes the multiplicative inverse of
Q modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
W

.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353.

Explanation:
Example case 2:
When
k=1, the score is
