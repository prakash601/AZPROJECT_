Given a string, S find the rank of the string amongst all its permutations sorted lexicographically.The rank can be big. So print it modulo 1000003. 
Note: Return 0 if the characters are repeated in the string.
Example 1:
Input: S = "abc"
Output: 1
Explaination: It is the smallest 
lexicographically string of the permutation.
Example 2:
Input: S = "acb"
Output: 2
Explaination: This is the second smallest
lexicographically string of the permutation.

You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function rank() which takes string S as input parameter and returns the rank modulo 1000003 of the string.
Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)
Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 15
