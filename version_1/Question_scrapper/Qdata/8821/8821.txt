There are
n
weighted points on the
OX
-axis. The coordinate and the weight of the
i
-th point is
xi
and
wi
, respectively. All points have distinct coordinates and positive weights. Also,
xi<xi+1
holds for any
1≤i<n
.
The weighted distance between
i
-th point and
j
-th point is defined as
|xi−xj|⋅(wi+wj)
, where
|val|
denotes the absolute value of
val
.
You should answer
q
queries, where the
i
-th query asks the following: Find the minimum weighted distance among all pairs of distinct points among the points in subarray
[li,ri]
.
Input
The first line contains 2 integers
n
and
q
(2≤n≤3⋅105;1≤q≤3⋅105)
— the number of points and the number of queries.
Then,
n
lines follows, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
xi
and
wi
(−109≤xi≤109;1≤wi≤109)
— the coordinate and the weight of the
i
-th point.
It is guaranteed that the points are given in the increasing order of
x
.
Then,
q
lines follows, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
li
and
ri
(1≤li<ri≤n)
— the given subarray of the
i
-th query.
Output
For each query output one integer, the minimum weighted distance among all pair of distinct points in the given subarray.

Note
For the first query, the minimum weighted distance is between points
1
and
3
, which is equal to
|x1−x3|⋅(w1+w3)=|−2−1|⋅(2+1)=9
.
For the second query, the minimum weighted distance is between points
2
and
3
, which is equal to
|x2−x3|⋅(w2+w3)=|0−1|⋅(10+1)=11
.
For the fourth query, the minimum weighted distance is between points
3
and
4
, which is equal to
|x3−x4|⋅(w3+w4)=|1−9|⋅(1+2)=24
.
