“You can make a lot by playing such games.”
Every player has to play a game of Ddakji with the recruiter in order to enter the squid game. Gi-Hun has played many rounds but was unable to win even once. The recruiter thus decided to give him a puzzle instead.
Gi-Hun is given an array
A of
N elements. He can perform the following operation on array
A any number of times:
Select any two indexes
1≤i,j≤N such that
i

=j and replace
A
i
with
A
i
−A
j
.
His task is to find the minimum possible value of
∣A
1
∣+∣A
2
∣+…+∣A
N
∣ attainable by performing these operations several (possibly,
0) times.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains
N, the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers —
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each testcase, print on a new line one integer — minimum possible value of
∣A
1
∣+∣A
2
∣+…+∣A
N
∣.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Perform the operation with
i=1 and
j=2 four times. The array is now
[0,1], and its value is
∣0∣+∣1∣=1.
Test Case 2: No operations need to be performed.
Test Case 4: Perform the following operations:
Choose
i=4,j=2 and set
A
4
=6−2=4. The array is now
[0,2,−2,4].
Choose
i=4,j=2 and set
A
4
=4−2=2. The array is now
[0,2,−2,2].
Choose
i=2,j=4 and set
A
2
=2−2=0. The array is now
[0,0,−2,2].
The value of the array is now
∣0∣+∣0∣+∣−2∣+∣2∣=4, and it can be proved that this is the minimum possible value.
