You are given coordinates of houses on the planet. Each house has exactly one minion and his power is given. The planet of minion is considered as a 2-D plane and the river is denoted by a straight line (
y=mx+c ).
Note: None of the houses are situated on the river. ###Input:
First-line will contain
N, number of houses.
Second-line will contain two integers,
and
denoting the river.
Next
N lines will have exactly 3 integers
X[i],Y[i],P[i] denoting the coordinates of houses and the power of minion in that house
###Output:
Print the maximum power of the team which Gru can recruit.
