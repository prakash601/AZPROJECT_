Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
M lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤M), the
i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid sequences modulo
1,000,000,007, or

Explanation:
Example case 1: Both elements of
A can be any positive integers, so there is an infinite number of valid sequences.
Example case 2: There are two constraints, but they are actually identical:
lcm(A
1
,A
2
)=1. The only sequence that satisfies this is
A=[1,1].
Example case 3: The two constraints contradict each other, so there is no valid sequence.
