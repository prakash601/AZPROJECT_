"I have only one rule, never submit partially correct code" -Barney Stinson
The religious act which Barney and his friends hold most sacred, XORING the natural numbers in the given range. This time Barney is a bit busy with picking up some girls, so he asked you to help him. He gave you two numbers
L and
R, you have to find if XOR of all the numbers in range L to R (L,R both inclusive) is odd or even.
Warning!! Large Input-Output. Please use Fast IO.
###Input:
The first line will contain
T, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers
L,R.
###Constraints
1≤T≤10
6
1≤L≤R≤10
18

Explanation:
Test case -1 -> XOR (1,2,3,4) =4
Test case -2 -> XOR (2,3,4,5,6) =6
Test case -3 -> XOR (3) =3
Test case -4 -> XOR (2,3) =1
