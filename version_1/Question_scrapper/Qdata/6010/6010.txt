In an undirected weighted graph, we define an
s−t mincut cost as the minimum sum of weights of edges which have to be removed from the graph so that there would be no path between vertices
s and
t.
You are given a two-dimensional array
A with size
N×N. You are allowed to increase the value of each element of this array by any non-negative integer (these integers may be different for different elements). Afterwards, the array
A should satisfy the following condition: there is a graph
G with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) such that for each
i and
j (
1≤i,j≤N), the
i−j mincut cost in
G is equal to
A
ij
.
Let's define the cost of the above operation as the sum of all integers added to elements of the initial array
A. Compute the minimum possible cost.
Note that: We consider only non-negative weight graphs.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains
N space-separated integers
A
i1
,A
i2
,…,A
iN
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum cost.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Of course, we must increase
A
12
by
1, since
A
21
=1. This is sufficient; one possible graph
G is shown in the picture below. (Disconnecting vertices
1 and
2 costs
1.)
Example case 2: Similarly, we must increase
A
12
by
1,
A
31
by
1 and
A
32
also by
1. This is again sufficient and a possible graph
G is shown in the picture below. (Disconnecting vertices
1 and
2 costs
1, disconnecting vertices
1,3 costs
3 and disconnecting
2,3 costs
1.)
