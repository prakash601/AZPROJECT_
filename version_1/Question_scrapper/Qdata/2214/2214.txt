Given K sorted lists of integers, KSortedArray[] of size N each. The task is to find the smallest range that includes at least one element from each of the K lists. If more than one such range's are found, return the first such range found.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, K = 3
KSortedArray[][] = {{1 3 5 7 9},
 {0 2 4 6 8},
 {2 3 5 7 11}}
Output: 1 2
Explanation: K = 3
A:[1 3 5 7 9]
B:[0 2 4 6 8]
C:[2 3 5 7 11]
Smallest range is formed by number 1
present in first list and 2 is present
in both 2nd and 3rd list.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 4, K = 3
KSortedArray[][] = {{1 2 3 4},
 {5 6 7 8},
 {9 10 11 12}}
Output: 4 9
Your Task :
Complete the function findSmallestRange() that receives array , array size n and k as parameters and returns the output range (as a pair in cpp and array of size 2 in java and python)
Expected Time Complexity : O(n * k *log k)
Expected Auxilliary Space  : O(k)
Constraints:
1 <= K,N <= 500
0 <= a[ i ] <= 105
