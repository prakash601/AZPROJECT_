,…,A
N
and an integer
K. Find the number of contiguous subsequences
A
L
,A
L+1
,…,A
R
such that
R−L+1≥K and the
K-th element of the subsequence (
A
L+K−1
) is equal to the maximum of all elements of the entire sequence.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and

Explanation:
Example case 1:
(3,4,5) is the only contiguous subsequence such that its
3-rd element is equal to the maximum of the whole sequence (which is
5).
