Chef gives you an array
A of length
N, consisting of integers. He asks you to choose a subarray with at least 2 elements of the given array. Following, out of your chosen subarray, Chef will pick out any two elements.
Your net score would be the sum of the remaining elements of the subarray. Obviously, Chef adopts a strategy to minimize your score. Find the maximum score you can have.
Input Format
The first line of input contains
T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case is as follows:
The first line contains
N denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers denoting the contents of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting your maximum score.

Explanation:
Test case
1: you choose subarray
[5,9,1], and Chef chooses elements
5 and
9. So your net score is
1.
Test case
2: you choose subarray
[1,1,1], and Chef chooses elements
1 and
1. So your net score is
1.
Test case
3: you choose subarray
[1,2,3,4,5], and Chef chooses elements
5 and
4. So your net score is
1+2+3=6.
Test case
4: you can only choose the subarray
[1,2], and Chef chooses elements
1 and
2. So your net score is
0 as no elements remain in your chosen subarray.
