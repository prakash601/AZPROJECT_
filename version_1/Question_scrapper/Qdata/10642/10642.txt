Evlampiy was gifted a rooted tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered from
1
to
n
. Each of its vertices also has an integer
ai
written on it. For each vertex
i
, Evlampiy calculated
ci
 — the number of vertices
j
in the subtree of vertex
i
, such that
aj<ai
.
Illustration for the second example, the first integer is
ai
and the integer in parentheses is
ci
After the new year, Evlampiy could not remember what his gift was! He remembers the tree and the values of
ci
, but he completely forgot which integers
ai
were written on the vertices.
Help him to restore initial integers!
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(1≤n≤2000)
— the number of vertices in the tree.
The next
n
lines contain descriptions of vertices: the
i
-th line contains two integers
pi
and
ci
(
0≤pi≤n
;
0≤ci≤n−1
), where
pi
is the parent of vertex
i
or
0
if vertex
i
is root, and
ci
is the number of vertices
j
in the subtree of vertex
i
, such that
aj<ai
.
It is guaranteed that the values of
pi
describe a rooted tree with
n
vertices.
Output
If a solution exists, in the first line print "YES", and in the second line output
n
integers
ai
(1≤ai≤109)
. If there are several solutions, output any of them. One can prove that if there is a solution, then there is also a solution in which all
ai
are between
1
and
109
.
If there are no solutions, print "NO".
