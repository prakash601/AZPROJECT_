Alice is teaching Bob maths via a game called
N-guesser.
Alice has a positive integer
N which Bob needs to guess. She gives him two pieces of information with which to do this:
A positive integer
X, which denotes the sum of divisors of
N.
Two positive integers
A and
B, which denote that the sum of reciprocals of divisors of
N is
A/B.
Bob either needs to guess
N or tell that no such number exists.
It can be shown that if a valid
N exists, it is unique.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers
X,A,B.
Output Format
For each test case, output a new line containing the answer — Alice's number
N, or
−1 if no such number exists.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The divisors of
3 are
1 and
3. Their sum is
4 and the sum of their reciprocals is
4/3.
Test case
2: It can be proved that no positive integer
N exists whose divisors sum to
4 and reciprocals of divisors sum to
1.
