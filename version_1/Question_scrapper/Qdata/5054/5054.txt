Explanation:
Test case
1: Two people (numbered
1 and
2) can be thief:
Person
1 may be the thief because, the other
3 people claim that he may be the thief, whereas, he lies and claims that person
2 is the thief.
Person
2 may be the thief because, the other
3 people claim that he may be the thief, whereas, he lies and claims that person
1 is the thief.
Person
3 cannot be the thief because, he claims that the thief lies in the range
[1,3]. If he were the thief, then his statement should be false. However, since 3 lies in
[1,3], his statement would be true, which results in a contradiction. Furthermore, the first
2 people do not claim that he is the thief. Therefore, he cannot be the thief.
Person
4 cannot be the thief because the first
3 people do not claim that he is the thief.
