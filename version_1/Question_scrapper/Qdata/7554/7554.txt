There is a game played on a one-dimensional axis.
N stones will appear on this axis. Each of these stones is described by three numbers
x
i
,
t
i
,
c
i
, meaning the stone will appear at a point
x
i
, at time
t
i
, and has a value
c
i
.
There are
p players initially (at time
0) all at the point
0. If a player is at a point
x at time
t, then at time
t+1, he/she can be either at
x or at
x+1. A player is able to pick up a stone with value
c
i
if he/she is at the point
x
i
at the time
t
i
. Picking up a stone does not take any time. Each stone can be picked up at most once.
The score of a player is defined as the sum of values of stones he/she has picked up. The score of a number of players is simply the sum of their individual scores. Devise a strategy for the players to gain the maximum total score.
You should find the maximum possible total score for each number of players
p between
1 and
K inclusive.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers
x
i
,
t
i
and
c
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print
K lines. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain a single integer - the maximum total score for
i players.
