You are given an integer
K and a tree of size
N, rooted at node
1. In one operation, you can either select a node of the tree and color its entire subtree or create a new (uncolored) copy of the given tree. Find the minimum number of operations required so that the total number of colored nodes among all trees is exactly
K.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. Then
T test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers
N and
K, the size of the given tree and the number of nodes to be colored, respectively.
The next line contains
N−1 integers
p
2
,…,p
n
, where
p
i
is the parent of node
i.
###Output For each testcase, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to color exactly
K total nodes.

###Subtasks
Subtask 1 (10 points): The tree is a simple path
Subtask 2 (35 points):

###Explanation
For the first test case:
Operation
1: The subtree of node
1 is colored (coloring a total of
3 nodes).
Operation
2: A new copy of tree is generated.
Operation
3: The subtree of node
2 of the new tree is colored.
Operation
4: The subtree of node
3 of the new tree is colored.
For the second test case:
Operation
1: The subtree of node
2 is colored (coloring a total of
3 nodes).
Operation
2: A new copy of tree is generated.
Operation
3: The subtree of node
2 is colored (coloring a total of
3 more nodes).
