You are given a binary matrix
b
(all elements of the matrix are
0
or
1
) of
n
rows and
n
columns.
You need to construct a
n
sets
A1,A2,…,An
, for which the following conditions are satisfied:
Each set is nonempty and consists of distinct integers between
1
and
n
inclusive.
All sets are distinct.
For all pairs
(i,j)
satisfying
1≤i,j≤n
,
bi,j=1
if and only if
Ai⊊Aj
. In other words,
bi,j
is
1
if
Ai
is a proper subset of
Aj
and
0
otherwise.
Set
X
is a proper subset of set
Y
, if
X
is a nonempty subset of
Y
, and
X≠Y
.
It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such
n
sets exist. Note that it doesn't mean that such
n
sets exist for all possible inputs.
If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
).
The following
n
lines contain a binary matrix
b
, the
j
-th character of
i
-th line denotes
bi,j
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
1000
.
It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such
n
sets exist.
Output
For each test case, output
n
lines.
For the
i
-th line, first output
si
(1≤si≤n)
 — the size of the set
Ai
. Then, output
si
distinct integers from
1
to
n
 — the elements of the set
Ai
.
If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.
It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such
n
sets exist.

Note
In the first test case, we have
A1={1,2,3},A2={1,3},A3={2,4},A4={1,2,3,4}
. Sets
A1,A2,A3
are proper subsets of
A4
, and also set
A2
is a proper subset of
A1
. No other set is a proper subset of any other set.
In the second test case, we have
A1={1},A2={1,2},A3={1,2,3}
.
A1
is a proper subset of
A2
and
A3
, and
A2
is a proper subset of
A3
.
