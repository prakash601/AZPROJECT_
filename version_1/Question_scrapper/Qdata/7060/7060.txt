There are
N events (numbered from
1 to
N) and
M contestants (numbered from
1 to
M). For each event
i, contestant
j receives a predetermined number of points
A
i,j
.
A subset of these events will be selected, and the final score of contestant
j, denoted
s
j
, will be the sum of their points for each event selected.
Formally, if
S denotes the set of events chosen, then
s
j
=
x∈S
∑
A
x,j
for each
1≤j≤M. If
S is empty, we define
s
j
=0 for each
j.
The differentiation of the final scoreboard is equal to
i=1

Find the maximum possible differentiation over all subsets of events.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of several lines.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of events and contestants, respectively.
The next
N lines describe the events. The
i-th of these
N lines contains
M space-separated integers
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,…,A
i,M
— the
j-th of which describes the number of points the
j-th contestant earns for event
i.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum differentiation over all subsets of events.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are two possible subsets of events — either take the only event, or don't. In either case, the differentiation will be
0.
Test case
2: Take events
2 and
3 for a final scoreboard of
(2,4,2). The differentiation of this scoreboard is
4, and it can be proven that this is the maximum.
Test case
3: Take events
3 and
5, for a final scoreboard of
(7,2), which has a differentiation of
5.
