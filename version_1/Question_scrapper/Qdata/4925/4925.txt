Chef is a high-ranked army officer and he has been given the job to train the army.
The army consists of
N soldiers where each soldier has
3 parameters:
Attack points:
A
i
where
(0<A
i
<1000);
Defense points:
(1000−A
i
);
Soldier type: ATTACK or DEFENSE.
For the whole army:
Attack value of the army is defined as the sum of attack points of all ATTACK type soldiers.
Defense value of the army is defined as the sum of defense points of all DEFENSE type soldiers.
Rating of the army is defined as the product of Attack value and Defense value of the army.
Assign the soldier type to each of the soldiers to maximize the rating of the army. Print the maximum rating.
NOTE: The output may exceed the range of a
32-bit integer.
Remember to use
64-bit data types, such as long long in C++.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of soldiers in the army.
The next line contains the array
A — where
A
i
denotes the attack points of the
i
th
soldier.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible rating that can be achieved.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
2≤N≤1000
0<A
i
<1000
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2000.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Soldier
1 should be used for ATTACK while soldier
2 should be used for DEFENSE. Thus, the attack value as well as the defense value equals
500. The rating
=500⋅500=250000. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible rating that we can achieve for the given army.
Test case
2:
Soldier
1 and
2 should be used for ATTACK. So, attack value
=500+500=1000
Soldier
3 should be used for DEFENSE. So, defense value
=(1000−500)=500
So, rating
=1000⋅500=500000. This is the maximum possible rating that we can achieve for the given army.
Test case
3:
Soldier
2 and
4 should be used for ATTACK. So, attack value
=800+500=1300
Soldier
1 and
3 should be used for DEFENSE. So, defense value
=(1000−100)+(1000−300)=1600
So, rating
=1300⋅1600=2080000. This is the maximum possible rating that we can achieve for the given army.
Test case
4:
Soldier
2 and
3 should be used for ATTACK. So, attack value
=700+800=1500
Soldier
1 and
4 should be used for DEFENSE. So, defense value
=(1000−300)+(1000−200)=1500
So, rating
=1500⋅1500=2250000. This is the maximum possible rating that we can achieve for the given army.
