Valera the horse lives on a plane. The Cartesian coordinate system is defined on this plane. Also an infinite spiral is painted on the plane. The spiral consists of segments: [(0, 0), (1, 0)], [(1, 0), (1, 1)], [(1, 1), ( - 1, 1)], [( - 1, 1), ( - 1,  - 1)], [( - 1,  - 1), (2,  - 1)], [(2,  - 1), (2, 2)] and so on. Thus, this infinite spiral passes through each integer point of the plane.
Valera the horse lives on the plane at coordinates (0, 0). He wants to walk along the spiral to point (x, y). Valera the horse has four legs, so he finds turning very difficult. Count how many times he will have to turn if he goes along a spiral from point (0, 0) to point (x, y).
Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers x and y (|x|, |y| ≤ 100).
Output
Print a single integer, showing how many times Valera has to turn.
