There is a
10×10 grid with rows numbered
1 to
10 from top to bottom, and columns
1 to
10 from left to right. Each cell is identified by a pair
(r, c) which means that the cell is located at row
r and column
c.
If Chef's current location is
(a,b), then in one move Chef can go to
(c,d) if both of the following are satisfied:
a

=c
b

=d
Determine the minimum number of moves required to go from
(s
x
,s
y
) to
(e
x
,e
y
).
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains four integer
s
x
,
s

,
e
x
,
e

— the coordinates of the starting and ending cells.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the minimum number of moves required to go from
(s

,s
y
) to
(e
x
,e
y
).

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef can go from
(1,2) to
(9,8) in one move since
1

=9 and
2

=8.
Test case 2: Chef will require at least two moves. One such sequence of moves is
(5,5)→(2,3)→(5,7).
