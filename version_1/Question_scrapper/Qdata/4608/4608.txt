Sheokand is good at mathematics. One day, to test his math skills, Kaali gave him an integer
N. To impress Kaali, Sheokand has to convert
N into an integer
M that can be represented in the form
2
x
+2
y
(where
x and
y are non-negative integers such that
x

=y). In order to do that, he can perform two types of operations:
add
1 to
N
subtract
1 from
N
However, Sheokand is preparing for his exams. Can you help him find the minimum number of operations required to convert
N into a valid integer
M?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of operations.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
N=10 is already in the form
2
x
+2
y
, with
x=3 and
y=1.
Example case 2:
N=22 can be converted into
M=20=2
2
+2
4
or
M=24=2
3
+2
4
in two operations.
Example case 3:
N=4 can be converted into
M=3=2
0
+2
1
or
M=5=2
0
+2
2
in one operation.
