You are given a tree with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). There are
K special nodes
f
1
,f
2
,…,f
K
in this tree.
We define
d(p,q) to be the number of edges on the unique path from node
p to node
q.
You are given a node
a. For each node
b from
1 to
N, find the maximum value of
d(a,u)−d(b,u) where
u is a special node, as well as any special node
u for which that maximum value is attained.
###Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
K,
a.
The second line contains
K space-separated integers
f
1
,f
2
,…,f
K
.
N−1 lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
denoting an edge of the tree.
###Output For each test case, print two lines.
In the first line print
N space-separated integers. For each valid
i, the
i-th integer should be the maximum value of
d(a,u)−d(i,u) where
u is a special node.
In the second line print
N space-separated integers. For each valid
i, the
i-th integer should be any special node
u for which the maximum of
d(a,u)−d(i,u) is attained.

###Explanation Example case 1: The following picture shows the tree in the first example case with special nodes in bold:
The only special node is the node
2 and
a=3. Therefore, the desired maximum is
d(a,2)−d(b,2)=d(3,2)−d(b,2)=2−d(b,2) for each node
b and it is always attained for the special node
u=2.
Example case 2: The following picture shows the tree in the second example case with special nodes bolded:
The special nodes are
6,
5 and
8, and
a=2. The maximum values of
d(a,u)−d(b,u) (
u being a special node) for each
b are as follows:
b=1: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(1,u) is
−1 and it is achieved for
u=5 since
d(2,5)−d(1,5)=1−2=−1.
b=2: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(2,u) is
0 and it is achieved for
u=5 since
d(2,5)−d(2,5)=1−1=0.
b=3: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(3,u) is
−1 and it is achieved for
u=5 since
d(2,5)−d(3,5)=1−2=−1.
b=4: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(4,u) is
1 and it is achieved for
u=6 since
d(2,6)−d(4,6)=2−1=1.
b=5: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(5,u) is
1 and it is achieved for
u=5 since
d(2,5)−d(5,5)=1−0=1.
b=6: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(6,u) is
2 and it is achieved for
u=6 since
d(2,6)−d(6,6)=2−0=2.
b=7: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(7,u) is
0 and it is achieved for
u=5 since
d(2,5)−d(7,5)=1−1=0.
b=8: The maximum value of
d(2,u)−d(8,u) is
2 and it is achieved for
u=8 since
d(2,8)−d(8,8)=2−0=2.
