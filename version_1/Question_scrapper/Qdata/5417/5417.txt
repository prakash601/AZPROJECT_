Vanja and Miksi really like games. After playing one game for a long time, they decided to invent another game!
In this game, they have a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and two numbers
Z
1
and
Z
2
. The rules of the game are as follows:
The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja.
There is an integer
S; at the beginning,
S=0.
In each turn, the current player must choose an arbitrary element of
A and either add that number to
S or subtract it from
S. Each element can be selected multiple times.
Afterwards, if
S=Z
1
or
S=Z
2
, the current player (the player who made
S equal to
Z
1
or
Z
2
) is the winner of the game.
If the game lasts for
10
10
turns, Vanja and Miksi decide to declare it a tie.
Can you help the boys determine the winner of the game? Please note that the game can end in a tie (if nobody can make
S=Z
1
or
S=Z
2
in the first
10
10
moves).
Both players play optimally, i.e. if there is a move which guarantees the current player's victory regardless of the other player's moves, the current player will make such a move. If the current player cannot win and there is a move which guarantees that the game will end in a tie, the current player will make such a move.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
Z
1
and
Z
2
.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the final result of the game:
1 if Vanja (the first player) has a winning strategy
2 if Miksi (the second player) has a winning strategy
0 if the game ends in a tie

Explanation:
Example case 1: The first player can choose the value
A
1
=−4, subtract it from
S=0 and obtain
S=−(−4)=4=Z
2
. The winner is the first player.
Example case 2: It can be proven that neither player is able to reach
S=Z
1
or
S=Z
2
. The result is a tie.
