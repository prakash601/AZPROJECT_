You're going to generate an array
a
with a length of at most
n
, where each
ai
equals either
1
or
−1
.
You generate this array in the following way.
First, you choose some integer
k
(
1≤k≤n
), which decides the length of
a
.
Then, for each
i
(
1≤i≤k
), you set
ai=1
with probability
pi
, otherwise set
ai=−1
(with probability
1−pi
).
After the array is generated, you calculate
si=a1+a2+a3+…+ai
. Specially,
s0=0
. Then you let
S
equal to
k
max
i=0
si
. That is,
S
is the maximum prefix sum of the array
a
.
You are given
n+1
integers
h0,h1,…,hn
. The score of an array
a
with maximum prefix sum
S
is
hS
. Now, for each
k
, you want to know the expected score for an array of length
k
modulo
109+7
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases. Their description follows.
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
).
Then for the following
n
lines, each line contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
0≤xi<109+7
,
1≤yi<109+7
,
xi≤yi
), indicating
pi=
xi
yi
.
The next line contains
n+1
integers
h0,h1,…,hn
(
0≤hi<109+7
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5000
.
Output
For each test case, output
n
integers in one single line, the
i
-th of which denotes the expected score for an array of length
i
, modulo
109+7
.
Formally, let
M=109+7
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to
p⋅q−1modM
. In other words, output such an integer
x
that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Note
In the first test case, if we choose
k=1
, there are
2
possible arrays with equal probabilities:
[1]
and
[−1]
. The
S
values for them are
1
and
0
. So the expected score is
1

h0+

h1=

k=2
, there are
4
possible arrays with equal probabilities:
[1,1]
,
[1,−1]
,
[−1,1]
,
[−1,−1]
, and the
S
values for them are
2,1,0,0
. So the expected score is
1

In the second test case, no matter what the
S
value is, the score is always
1
, so the expected score is always
1
.
