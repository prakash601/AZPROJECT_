There's a tree and every one of its nodes has a cost associated with it. Some of these nodes are labelled special nodes. You are supposed to answer a few queries on this tree. In each query, a source and destination node (
SNODE and
DNODE) is given along with a value
W. For a walk between
SNODE and
DNODE to be valid you have to choose a special node and call it the pivot
P. Now the path will be
SNODE ->
P ->
DNODE. For any valid path, there is a path value (
PV) attached to it. It is defined as follows:
Select a subset of nodes(can be empty) in the path from
SNODE to
P (both inclusive) such that sum of their costs (
CTOT
1
) doesn't exceed
W.
Select a subset of nodes(can be empty) in the path from
P to
DNODE (both inclusive) such that sum of their costs (
CTOT
2
) doesn't exceed
W.
Now define
1
2
such that the absolute difference
x=∣CTOT
1
−CTOT
2
∣ is as low as possible. If there are multiple pairs of subsets that give the same minimum absolute difference, the pair of subsets which maximize
PV should be chosen.
For each query, output the path value
PV minimizing
x as defined above.
Note that the sum of costs of an empty subset is zero.
###Input
First line contains three integers
N - number of vertices in the tree,
NSP - number of special nodes in the tree and
Q - number of queries to answer.
Second line contains
N−1 integers. If the
ith integer is
V
i
then there is an undirected edge between
i+1 and
V
i
(
i starts from
1 and goes till
N−1).
Third line contains
N integers, the
ith integer represents cost of the
ith vertex.
Fourth line contains
NSP integers - these represent which nodes are the special nodes.
Following
Q lines contains three integers each -
SNODE,
DNODE and
W for each query.
###Output
For each query output a single line containing a single integer - the path value
PV between
SNODE and
DNODE.

###Explanation:
Consider query
4. The only path is
4−>2−>1−>2−>5. The two sets defined for this path are {
3,2,5} and {
3,5,7}. Pick subsets {
3,2,5} and {
3,7} from each set which minimizes
PV. Note that node
2 can repeat as it is in different paths (both to and from the pivot).
