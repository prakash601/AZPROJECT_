Chef is given a tree with
N nodes and a positive integer
K. Each node is assigned a value
A
i
.
Chef has to divide the tree into a forest of exactly
K trees, numbered from
1 to
K, such that each node belongs to exactly one tree.
Let
B
i
denote the bitwise XOR of the values of all nodes belonging to the
i
th
tree.
Find the maximum possible value of
B

, where
& denotes the bitwise AND operation.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines:
The first line contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the number of nodes in the tree and a positive integer as mentioned in the statement, respectively.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, the values assigned to each node.
The next
(N−1) lines describe the edges. The
i
th
of these
(N−1) lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between nodes
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer, the maximum possible value of

Explanation:
Test case
1: A possible way of dividing the nodes into
2 trees is
[1,3,6] and
[2,4,5].
B

=1⊕2⊕5=6
B

Thus,
B

&
7=6.
Note that this is the maximum possible value of

you can obtain.
Another way of dividing is
[1,2,4,5] and
[3,6], which leads to the same answer.
Test case
2: A possible way of dividing the nodes into
3 trees is
[1,3,6,7,8],
[4], and
[2,5]
