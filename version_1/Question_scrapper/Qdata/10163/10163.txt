You are given a tree with
n
vertices. You are allowed to modify the structure of the tree through the following multi-step operation:
Choose three vertices
a
,
b
, and
c
such that
b
is adjacent to both
a
and
c
.
For every vertex
d
other than
b
that is adjacent to
a
, remove the edge connecting
d
and
a
and add the edge connecting
d
and
c
.
Delete the edge connecting
a
and
b
and add the edge connecting
a
and
c
.
As an example, consider the following tree:
The following diagram illustrates the sequence of steps that happen when we apply an operation to vertices
2
,
4
, and
5
:
It can be proven that after each operation, the resulting graph is still a tree.
Find the minimum number of operations that must be performed to transform the tree into a star. A star is a tree with one vertex of degree
n−1
, called its center, and
n−1
vertices of degree
1
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅105
)  — the number of vertices in the tree.
The
i
-th of the following
n−1
lines contains two integers
ui
and
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
,
ui≠vi
) denoting that there exists an edge connecting vertices
ui
and
vi
. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
Output
Print a single integer  — the minimum number of operations needed to transform the tree into a star.
It can be proven that under the given constraints, it is always possible to transform the tree into a star using at most
1018
operations.

Note
The first test case corresponds to the tree shown in the statement. As we have seen before, we can transform the tree into a star with center at vertex
5
by applying a single operation to vertices
2
,
4
, and
5
.
In the second test case, the given tree is already a star with the center at vertex
4
, so no operations have to be performed.
