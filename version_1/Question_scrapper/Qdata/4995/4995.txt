You are given an array
A with
N integers. You have to tell Chef whether this array is closed under multiplication.
We say that an array is closed under multiplication if, for all sequences
1≤S
1
<S
2
<⋯<S
k
≤N, there exists
1≤x≤N such that
A
S
1
⋅A
S
2
⋅⋯⋅A
S
k
=A
x
.
Output 1 if it is closed, and 0 otherwise.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer -
N
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers - the
i
th
of which is
A
i
Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Output
1 if
A is closed under multiplication, and
0 otherwise.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
[1,0,3] is closed under multiplication.

Therefore, the answer for the first test case is
1.
Test case

=3⋅3=9 is not present in the array. Therefore,
[1,3,3] is not closed under multiplication, and the answer is
0.
