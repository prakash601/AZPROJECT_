Given a String S , print the reverse of the string as output.

Example 1:
Input: S = "GeeksforGeeks"
Output: "skeeGrofskeeG" 
Explanation: Element at first is at last and
last is at first, second is at second last and 
second last is at second position and so on .
Example 2:
Input: S = "ReversE"
Output: "EsreveR"
Explanation: "E" at first and "R" at last and
"e" at second last and "s" at second and
so on .


You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function revStr() which takes S as input parameter and returns the reversed string .

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

Constraints:
1<= |S| <=1000
