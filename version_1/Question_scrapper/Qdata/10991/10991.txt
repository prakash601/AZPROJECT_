You are given a weighted tree consisting of
n
vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles. Vertices
ui
and
vi
are connected by an edge with weight
wi
.
You are given
m
queries. The
i
-th query is given as an integer
qi
. In this query you need to calculate the number of pairs of vertices
(u,v)
(
u<v
) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between
u
and
v
doesn't exceed
qi
.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅105
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.
Each of the next
n−1
lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge
i
is denoted by three integers
ui
,
vi
and
wi
— the labels of vertices it connects (
1≤ui,vi≤n
,
ui≠vi
) and the weight of the edge (
1≤wi≤2⋅105
). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
The last line of the input contains
m
integers
q1,q2,…,qm
(
1≤qi≤2⋅105
), where
qi
is the maximum weight of an edge in the
i
-th query.
Output
Print
m
integers — the answers to the queries. The
i
-th value should be equal to the number of pairs of vertices
(u,v)
(
u<v
) such that the maximum weight of an edge on a simple path between
u
and
v
doesn't exceed
qi
.
Queries are numbered from
1
to
m
in the order of the input.
