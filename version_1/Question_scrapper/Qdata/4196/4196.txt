You are given a binary string
S of length
N.
You have to perform the following operation exactly once:
Select an index
i
(1≤i≤N) and delete
S
i
from
S. The remaining parts of
S are concatenated in the same order.
How many distinct binary strings of length
N−1 can you get after applying this operation?
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the length of the binary string
S.
The second line contains the binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct binary strings that you can get after applying the operation exactly once.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
5
2≤N≤10

Sum of
N does not exceed
2⋅10

over all testcases.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: We have
S=100. Now, we can get
00 (on deleting
S
1
),
10 (on deleting
S
2
) and
10 (on deleting
S
3
). Therefore, we can get
2 distinct strings.
Test Case 2: We have
S=1111. Now, we will always get
111 irrespective of the index
i on which we apply the operation. Therefore, we can get
1 distinct string.
