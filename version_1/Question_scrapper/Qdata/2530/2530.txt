Given an increasing sequence a[], we need to find the K-th missing contiguous element in the increasing sequence which is not present in the sequence. If no k-th missing element is there output -1.
Example 1:
Input : arr[ ] = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7} and K = 2
Output : 6
Explanation:
K = 2, We need to find the 2nd missing 
number in the array. Missing numbers are 
2 and 6. So 2nd missing number is 6.
  Example 2:
Input : arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and K = 1
Output : -1
  Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function KthMissingElement() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), an integer K and return the Kth missing number if present otherwise returns -1. The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
  Constraints:
1 ≤ N, K, A[i] ≤ 105
