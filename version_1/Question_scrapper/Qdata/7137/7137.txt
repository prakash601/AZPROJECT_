You are given a tree containing
N nodes numbered from
1 to
N such that the
i
th
node has a value
A
i
assigned to it. The root of the tree is node
1.
The power of each node is the maximum value assigned to any node present in the subtree of the node.
You are given an integer
X. Your task is to make the sum of the powers of all the nodes of the tree greater than or equal to
X. For this, you can perform the following operation:
Choose any node
i
(1≤i≤N) and set
A
i
:=A
i
+1.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the powers of all the nodes of the tree greater than or equal to
X.
Note that, the subtree of a node
V is the set of all nodes
U such that
V lies on the simple path from
U to the root.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
X — the number of nodes and the target sum
X.
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, the values assigned to the nodes.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges. The
i
th
of these
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Perform
6 operations on node
2 to make the value assigned to it equal to
22. Thus, power of each node will become
22 and
87≤22⋅4.
It can be proven that we can not satisfy the condition in less than
6 operations.
Test case
2: Sum of power already satisfies the condition.
