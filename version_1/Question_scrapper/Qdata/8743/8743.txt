You are given an integer
n
and a string
s
consisting of
2n
lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The characters of the string
s
are
s0s1s2⋯s2n−1
.
A string
t
of length
2n
(whose characters are denoted by
t0t1t2⋯t2n−1
) is a xoration of
s
if there exists an integer
j
(
0≤j≤2n−1
) such that, for each
0≤i≤2n−1
,
ti=si⊕j
(where
⊕
denotes the operation bitwise XOR).
Find the lexicographically minimal xoration of
s
.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤18
).
The second line contains a string
s
consisting of
2n
lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
Output
Print a single line containing the lexicographically minimal xoration of
s
.

Note
In the first test, the lexicographically minimal xoration
t
of
s=
"acba" is "abca". It's a xoration because, for
j=3
,
t0=s0⊕j=s3=
"a";
t1=s1⊕j=s2=
"b";
t2=s2⊕j=s1=
"c";
t3=s3⊕j=s0=
"a".
There isn't any xoration of
s
lexicographically smaller than "abca".
In the second test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing
j=4
in the definition of xoration.
In the third test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing
j=11
in the definition of xoration.
In the fourth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing
j=10
in the definition of xoration.
In the fifth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing either
j=0
or
j=1
in the definition of xoration.
