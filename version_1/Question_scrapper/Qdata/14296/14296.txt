A way to make a new task is to make it nondeterministic or probabilistic. For example, the hard task of Topcoder SRM 595, Constellation, is the probabilistic version of a convex hull.
Let's try to make a new task. Firstly we will use the following task. There are n people, sort them by their name. It is just an ordinary sorting problem, but we can make it more interesting by adding nondeterministic element. There are n people, each person will use either his/her first name or last name as a handle. Can the lexicographical order of the handles be exactly equal to the given permutation p?
More formally, if we denote the handle of the i-th person as hi, then the following condition must hold: .
Input
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of people.
The next n lines each contains two strings. The i-th line contains strings fi and si (1 ≤ |fi|, |si| ≤ 50) — the first name and last name of the i-th person. Each string consists only of lowercase English letters. All of the given 2n strings will be distinct.
The next line contains n distinct integers: p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n).
Output
If it is possible, output "YES", otherwise output "NO".

Note
In example 1 and 2, we have 3 people: tourist, Petr and me (cgy4ever). You can see that whatever handle is chosen, I must be the first, then tourist and Petr must be the last.
In example 3, if Copernicus uses "copernicus" as his handle, everything will be alright.
