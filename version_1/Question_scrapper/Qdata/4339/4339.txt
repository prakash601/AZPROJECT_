You are given an array
A of
N elements. For any ordered triplet
(i,j,k) such that
i,
j, and
k are pairwise distinct and
1≤i,j,k≤N, the value of this triplet is
(A
i
−A
j
)⋅A
k
. You need to find the maximum value among all possible ordered triplets.
Note: Two ordered triplets
(a,b,c) and
(d,e,f) are only equal when
a=d and
b=e and
c=f. As an example,
(1,2,3) and
(2,3,1) are two different ordered triplets.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum value among all different ordered triplets.
