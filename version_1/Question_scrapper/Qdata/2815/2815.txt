Given a linked list sorted in ascending order and an integer called data, insert data in the linked list such that the list remains sorted.
Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 25->36->47->58->69->80
data: 19
Output: 19 25 36 47 58 69 80
Example 2:
Input:
LinkedList: 50->100
data: 75
Output: 50 75 100
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function () which should insert the element in sorted Linked List and return the head of the linked list
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
-99999 <= A[i] <= 99999, for each valid i
