i is odd.
Chef will add
2 to
A if

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can make
A and
B equal, NO otherwise.
Note that the checker is case-insensitive. So, YES, Yes, yEs are all considered same.
