All strings in Chefland are beautiful because they are binary strings (a binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'). The beauty of a binary string
S is defined as the number of pairs
(i,j) (
1≤i≤j≤∣S∣) such that the substring
S
i
,S
i+1
,…,S
j
is special.
For a binary string
U, let's denote the number of occurrences of the characters '1' and '0' in
U by
cnt
1
and
cnt
0
respectively; then,
U is special if
cnt

Today, Chef's friend Araspa is celebrating her birthday. Chef wants to give Araspa the most beautiful binary string he can find. Currently, he is checking out binary strings in a shop, but he needs your help to calculate their beauties. Tell Chef the beauty of each binary string he gives you.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string
S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the beauty of the string
S.
Constraints
