Dr.D is now fond of matrices. He is particularly interested in Doofish Matrices. A Doofish Matrix of order
N is a matrix with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
N columns (numbered
1 through
N) such that:
Each element of this matrix is an integer between
1 and
2N−1 inclusive.
For each
i and
j (
1≤i≤N,
1≤j≤2N−1), the integer
j appears in the
i-th row and/or in the
i-th column.
Now, for a given
N, Dr.D is wondering if there is a Doofish Matrix of order
N. Find such a matrix or determine that it does not exist. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case:
First, print a line containing the string "Hooray" if a Doofish Matrix of order
N exists or "Boo" if it does not.
If it exists, print
N more lines describing one such matrix. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain
N space-separated integers ― the elements in the
i-th row.
Constraints
