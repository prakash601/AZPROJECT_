Given an integer N and an integer D, rotate the binary representation of the integer N by D digits to the left as well as right and print the results in decimal values after each of the rotation.
Note: Integer N is stored using 16 bits. i.e. 12 will be stored as 0000.....001100.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 28, D = 2
Output:
112
7
Explanation: 28 in Binary is:
000...011100
Rotating left by 2 positions, it becomes
00...1110000 = 112 (in decimal).
Rotating right by 2 positions, it becomes
000...000111 = 7 (in decimal).
â€‹Example 2:
Input: 
N = 29, D = 2
Output: 
116
16391
Explanation: 29 in Binary is:
000...011101
Rotating left by 2 positions, it becomes
00...1110100 = 116 (in decimal).
Rotating right by 2 positions, it becomes
010...000111 = 16391 (in decimal).

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function rotate() which takes the integer N and integer D as inputs and returns an array of size 2 where arr[0] = Decimal value after left rotation and arr[1] = Decimal value after right rotation.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <  216
1 <= D <= 105
