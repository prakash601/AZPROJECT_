Utkarsh is forced to play another game with Ashish.
In this game there are
N piles,
i
th
pile contains
A
i
stones. Utkarsh moves first.
In his turn a player can choose any pile with non-zero stones and remove exactly one stone from that pile. The game ends when there is exactly one pile containing non-zero stones and the player who made the last move wins the game.
Now you are given an array
B of length
N. Utkarsh wants to know for how many arrays A such that
1≤A
i
≤B
i
for every
i, he will win the game assuming that both players play optimally.
Since the answer can be large output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case consists of an integer
N.
Second line consists of
N space separated integers denoting the array
B.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the number of games Utkarsh wins modulo
998244353.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
2≤N≤500

Explanation:
For the first test case, Utkarsh wins the game for following arrays:
[1,1],
[1,2],
[1,3],
[2,1],
[3,1],
[2,3],
[3,2].
So there are total
7 possibilities.
