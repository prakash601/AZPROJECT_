In a test, there are
N problems, each carrying
X marks.
In each problem, Chef either received
X marks or
0 marks.
Determine whether is it possible for Chef to achieve exactly
Y marks.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case, output YES if Chef can achieve exactly
Y marks, NO otherwise.
You can print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings Yes, YES, yes, and yEs, are all considered identical.
