Chef is given two arrays
A and
B of length
N each.
In one operation Chef can choose one element of
A and one element of
B and increase them by
1.
More formally: Chef can pick two integers
i,j
(1≤i,j≤N) and increment
A
i
and
B
j
by
1.
Determine the minimum number of operations required to make
A and
B equal.
Output
−1 if it is not possible to make
A and
B equal.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N - denoting the length of arrays
A and
B.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to make
A and

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can choose
i=1 and
j=2 and increment
A
i
and
B
j
by
1. Thus, both arrays become
[2,2] and are equal. We require only
1 operation to make these arrays equal. It can be proven that the arrays cannot be made equal in less than one operation.
Test case
2: Both the arrays cannot be made equal using any number of operations.
Test case
3: We perform
2 operations as follows:
Choose
i=1,j=3: The arrays become
A=[5,6,8] and
B=[5,7,7].
Choose
i=2,j=3: The arrays become
A=[5,7,8] and
B=[5,7,8].
Thus, both arrays can be made equal using
2 operations.
