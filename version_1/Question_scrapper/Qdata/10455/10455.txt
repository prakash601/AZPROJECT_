You are given three integers
n
,
k
,
m
and
m
conditions
(l1,r1,x1),(l2,r2,x2),…,(lm,rm,xm)
.
Calculate the number of distinct arrays
a
, consisting of
n
integers such that:
0≤ai<2k
for each
1≤i≤n
;
bitwise AND of numbers
a[li]&a[li+1]&…&a[ri]=xi
for each
1≤i≤m
.
Two arrays
a
and
b
are considered different if there exists such a position
i
that
ai≠bi
.
The number can be pretty large so print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
k
and
m
(
1≤n≤5⋅105
,
1≤k≤30
,
0≤m≤5⋅105
) — the length of the array
a
, the value such that all numbers in
a
should be smaller than
2k
and the number of conditions, respectively.
Each of the next
m
lines contains the description of a condition
li
,
ri
and
xi
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
,
0≤xi<2k
) — the borders of the condition segment and the required bitwise AND value on it.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of distinct arrays
a
that satisfy all the above conditions modulo
998244353
.

Note
You can recall what is a bitwise AND operation here.
In the first example, the answer is the following arrays:
[3,3,7,6]
,
[3,7,7,6]
and
[7,3,7,6]
.
