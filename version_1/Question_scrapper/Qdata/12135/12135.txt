You are given a set of size
m
with integer elements between
0
and
2n−1
inclusive. Let's build an undirected graph on these integers in the following way: connect two integers
x
and
y
with an edge if and only if
x&y=0
. Here
&
is the bitwise AND operation. Count the number of connected components in that graph.
Input
In the first line of input there are two integers
n
and
m
(
0≤n≤22
,
1≤m≤2n
).
In the second line there are
m
integers
a1,a2,…,am
(
0≤ai<2n
) — the elements of the set. All
ai
are distinct.
Output
Print the number of connected components.
