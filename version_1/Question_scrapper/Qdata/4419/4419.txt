Chef is given an integer
N. Chef wants to construct a permutation
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] of
{1,2,3,…,N} that satisfies the following condition:
Let
P
i
denote the prefix of
A of length
i, i.e,
P
i
=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
]. Then, for every
1≤i<N, it must hold that
median(P
i
)

=median(P
i+1
)
Help Chef find such a permutation
A. If multiple answers exist, you may print any of them.
Note: The median of an array is defined as follows:
Let
A be an (
1-indexed) array of length
N. Let
B be the array obtained by sorting
A. Then
median(A) is defined to be
B
⌈
2
N
⌉
. For example,
median({3,1,2})=2, and
median({3,4,1,2})=2
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output the required permutation. If multiple answers are possible, you may print any of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤30
2≤N≤1000
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
1000.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The prefixes of the given permutation are
[2] and
[2,1], with medians
2 and
1 respectively.
Test case
2: The prefixes of the given permutation are
[2] (with median
2),
[2,1] (with median
1), and
[2,1,3] (with median
2). No two adjacent medians are equal.
