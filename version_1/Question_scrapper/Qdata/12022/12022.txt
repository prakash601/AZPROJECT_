You are given an integer sequence
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
.
Find the number of pairs of indices
(𝑙,𝑟)
(
1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛
) such that the value of median of
𝑎
𝑙
,
𝑎
𝑙+1
,…,
𝑎
𝑟
is exactly the given number
𝑚
.
The median of a sequence is the value of an element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.
For example, if
𝑎=[4,2,7,5]
then its median is
4
since after sorting the sequence, it will look like
[2,4,5,7]
and the left of two middle elements is equal to
4
. The median of
[7,1,2,9,6]
equals
6
since after sorting, the value
6
will be in the middle of the sequence.
Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices
(𝑙,𝑟)
(
1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛
) such that the value of median of
𝑎
𝑙
,
𝑎
𝑙+1
,…,
𝑎
𝑟
is exactly the given number
𝑚
.
