You are given
N distinct points on a two-dimensional plane. It is guaranteed that no three of them are collinear. Let's call a subset of these points compact if the convex hull of this subset has exactly four vertices.
Find the number of compact non-empty subsets of the given points. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
.
Each of the next
N lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
y denoting the coordinates of one point.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of compact subsets modulo
10
