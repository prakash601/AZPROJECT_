You are given two positive integers
a and
b, we define
f(a,b) as the maximum value of
∣gcd(a,x)−gcd(b,x)∣ where
x is some natural number. Formally,
f(a,b)=
x∈N
max
∣gcd(a,x)−gcd(b,x)∣
, where
N represents the set of natural numbers and
gcd(a,b) represents the greatest common divisor of
a and
b.
You are given an integer
k. You need to find the number of ordered pairs
(a,b) (where
a,b are positive) such that
f(a,b)=k.
Note that pairs
(a,b) and
(b,a) are considered different if
a

=b. For example, pair
(1,2) is not the same as
(2,1).
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer
k.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the number of ordered pairs
(a,b) such that
f(a,b)=k.

Explanation:
Test case
1: For
k=1, we see that
f(1,2)=f(2,1)=1. Therefore the answer is
2. It can be verified that there are no other pairs for which the
f value is
1.
Test case
2: For
k=3, there exists
6 ordered pairs for which the
f value is
3. One of them is
(4,3).
