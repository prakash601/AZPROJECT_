Implement different operations on a vector A .
  Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. The first line of input contains an integer Q denoting the no of queries . Then in the next line are Q space separated queries .
A query can be of five types 
1. a x (Adds an element x to the vector A at the end )
2. b (Sorts the vector A in ascending order )
3. c (Reverses the vector A)
4. d (prints the size of the vector)
5. e (prints space separated values of the vector)
5. f  (Sorts the vector A in descending order)


Output:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers denoting the results of each query . 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Q<=100

Example:
Input
2
6
a 4 a 6 a 7 b c e
4
a 55 a 11 d e
 
Output
7 6 4
2 55 11

Explanation :
For the first test case
There are six queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a 4 { Vector has 4  }
2. a 7 {vector has 7 }
3. a 6 {vector has 6}
4. b {sorts the vector in ascending order, vector now is 5 6 7}
5. c {reverse the vector }
6. e {prints the element of the vectors 7 6 4}

For the sec test case 
There are four queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a 55  (vector A has 55}
2. a 11  (vector A has 55 ,11}
3. d      (prints the size of the vector A ie. 2 )
4. e      (prints the elements of the vector A ie 55 11)


Note:The Input/Output format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
