You are given two positive integers
N and
K, where
K≤N. Find a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
such that:
for each valid
i,
A
i
is either
i or
−i
there are exactly
K values of
i such that
1≤i≤N and
A
1
+A
2
+…+A
i
>0
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them. It can be proved that at least one solution always exists.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
