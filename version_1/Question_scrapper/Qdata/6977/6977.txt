In other words, a sequence is unfriendly if any two elements on the distance at most

You are given a sequence

N
. Find the length of its longest unfriendly subsequence.
A sequence
C is a subsequence of a sequence
D if
C can be obtained from
D by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example,
(1,3,5) is a subsequence of
(1,2,3,4,5) while
(3,1) is not.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T
− the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

Explanation:
In the first test case, the longest unfriendly subsequences are
(1,2) and
(2,1). The subsequence
(1,2,1), for example, is not unfriendly, as its
1-st and
3-rd elements are equal.
In the second test case, the longest unfriendly subsequence is
(1,2,3,1,2,3). It's clear that the subsequence which consists of the whole sequence is not unfriendly, so the answer is
6.
In the third test case, the longest unfriendly subsequence is
(1,10,100,1).
