Chef has an ore with melting point of
X degrees.
Chef’s kiln has a initial temperature of
Y degrees. The temperature of the kiln increases by
i degrees after the
i
th
minute.
Find the minimum time in minutes after which the ore starts melting.
Note:
We are only concerned about the temperature at the end of each minute and not during a minute.
The ore starts melting if the temperature of the kiln becomes greater than or equal to the melting point.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
X and
Y — the melting point of the ore and the initial temperature of kiln.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum time in minutes after which the ore starts melting.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The initial temperature of the kiln is
2 and the melting point of ore is
3.
After first minute, the temperature of kiln increases by
1.
Thus, after
1 minute the temperature of kiln becomes
2+1=3, which is equal to the melting point. Thus, the ore starts melting.
Test case
2: The initial temperature of the kiln is
3 and the melting point of ore is
5.
After first minute, the temperature of kiln increases by
1, and becomes
4.
After second minute, the temperature of kiln increases by
2, and becomes
6.
Thus, after
2 minutes the temperature of kiln becomes
6, which is greater than the melting point. Thus, the ore starts melting.
Test case
3: The initial temperature of the kiln is
5 and the melting point of ore is
10.
After first minute, the temperature of kiln increases by
1, and becomes
6.
After second minute, the temperature of kiln increases by
2, and becomes
8.
After third minute, the temperature of kiln increases by
3, and becomes
11.
Thus, after
3 minutes the temperature of kiln becomes
11, which is greater than the melting point. Thus, the ore starts melting.
