Chiyuu has a bracket sequence
†
𝑠
of length
𝑛
. Let
𝑘
be the minimum number of characters that Chiyuu has to remove from
𝑠
to make
𝑠
balanced
‡
.
Now, Koxia wants you to count the number of ways to remove
𝑘
characters from
𝑠
so that
𝑠
becomes balanced, modulo
998244353
.
Note that two ways of removing characters are considered distinct if and only if the set of indices removed is different.
†
A bracket sequence is a string containing only the characters "(" and ")".
‡
A bracket sequence is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters + and 1. For example, sequences (())(), (), (()(())) and the empty string are balanced, while )(, ((), and (()))( are not.
Input
The first line of input contains a string
𝑠
(
1≤|𝑠|≤5⋅
10
5
) — the bracket sequence.
It is guaranteed that
𝑠
only contains the characters "(" and ")".
Output
Output a single integer — the number of ways to remove
𝑘
characters from
𝑠
so that
𝑠
becomes balanced, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, it can be proved that the minimum number of characters that Chiyuu has to remove is
2
. There are
4
ways to remove
2
characters to make
𝑠
balanced as follows. Deleted characters are noted as red.
())(()

.
In the second test case, the only way to make
𝑠
balanced is by deleting the only character to get an empty bracket sequence, which is considered balanced.
