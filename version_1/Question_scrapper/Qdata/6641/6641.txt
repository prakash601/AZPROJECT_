  One free afternoon, Chef found an old board game in his kitchen. He decided to invite his friends Miron and Slava to come play it with him.
The board is a rectangular grid of size 2 × N. Initially, Miron and Slava each put their chips at a location (x1,y1 ) and (x2,y2 ) respectively. The game then proceeds as follows :
Each player moves their chip in turns.
In each turn, a player can move his chip to an adjacent cell that has not been visited by the other player before.
Two cells are adjacent if they share a side
A player can also skip his turn
The cell that is initially occupied by a particular player's chip is considered visited by him
The outcome of the game is decided as follows :
If a player manages to visit strictly more than half the total number of cells (i.e. visited at least N+1 cells), he immediately wins and the other player loses.
if the game continued for more than 10100 turns without any player declared a winner yet then it becomes a draw.
Given that both players move optimally and Miron starts first, can you help Chef predict the winner of the game?
Input
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing five space-separated integers N, x1, y1, x2, y2.
Output
For each test case, output a single line with string Miron, Slava or Draw, denoting the answer to the problem.

1 ≤ N ≤ 1018
1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ 2
1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ N
Cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are different.
