You are given an integer
N where
N≤10. Consider any array
A with length
N where each element can either be
0,
1, or
2, we define
f(A) as the number of extrema in
A. You need to find the sum of
f(A) over all possible arrays
A.
Note:
In an array
A, we consider
A
i
as an extremum if it is strictly greater than both of its neighbors (i.e.
A
i
>A
i−1
and
A
i
>A
i+1
), or if it is strictly smaller than both of its neighbors (i.e.
A
i
<A
i−1
and
A
i
<A
i+1
). Note that first and last elements are not counted as extremum.
Extrema is the plural of extremum.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer
- the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single the sum of
f(A) over all possible arrays
A.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
A=[0]. Then
f(A)=0.
A=[1]. Then
f(A)=0.
A=[2]. Then
f(A)=0.
Therefore the answer is
0.
Test case
2: There are
10 arrays
A with
f(A)=1:
A=[0,1,0].
A=[0,2,0].
A=[0,2,1].
A=[1,2,0].
A=[1,2,1].
A=[2,1,2].
A=[2,0,2].
A=[2,0,1].
A=[1,0,2].
A=[1,0,1].
The remaining
A's has
f(A)=0. Therefore the answer is
1⋅10=10.
