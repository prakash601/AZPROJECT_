A permutation of length
N is an array of
N integers such that every integer between
1 and
N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once.
Chef creates a set from a permutation
(P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
) of length
N, as follows:
Initially Chef takes a empty set
S=ϕ, and then for every index
i(1≤i≤N), Chef insert a pair of integers
(l
i
,r
i
) into
S, where
1≤l
i
≤r
i
≤N and
(P
l
i
,P
l
i
+1
,…,P
r
i
) denotes the longest subsegment of the permutation with
P
i
as the maximum element.
Note:
The elements of the set
S are always distinct.
Two pairs
(l
i
,r
i
) and
(l
j
,r
j
) are same only if
l
i
=l
j
and
r
i
=r
j
.
For example, if the permutation is
(2,3,4,1), Chef creates the following set
S={(1,1),(1,2),(1,4),(4,4)}.
You are given a set
T containing
N distinct pairs of integers. Find the number of different permutations of length
N from which Chef can create a set
S, which is equivalent to set
T. Since the number can be very large, print it modulo
(10
9
+7).
Two sets
S and
T are considered equivalent if:
∣S∣=∣T∣, where
∣S∣ denotes the size of set
S.
Every element of
S is present in
T, i.e, for each
(l
i
,r
i
)∈S,(l
i
,r
i
)∈T.
Note that the elements of the set
T may not be given in a particular order.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the size of set
T.
Each of the next
N lines contains a pair of integers
(l
i
,r
i
), denoting the set
T.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of valid permutations, modulo
(10
9
+7).

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are two permutations of length
2.
[1,2] generates the set
S={(1,1),(1,2)} which is not equivalent to
T={(2,2),(1,2)} and
[2,1] generates the set
S={(1,2),(2,2)}, which is equivalent to
T={(2,2),(1,2)}.
Test case
2: There is no permutation of length
3 which can generate a set equivalent to
T={(3,3),(1,3),(2,2)}.
Test case
3: Some of the valid permutations are:
[2,4,5,3,1],
[1,4,5,3,2],
[1,2,5,4,3] etc. However
[1,2,3,4,5] is not a valid permutation since it generates the set
S={(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5)} which is not equivalent to set
T.
