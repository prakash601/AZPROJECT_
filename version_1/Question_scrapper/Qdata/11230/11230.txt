You're given an array
a
of length
2n
. Is it possible to reorder it in such way so that the sum of the first
n
elements isn't equal to the sum of the last
n
elements?
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
), where
2n
is the number of elements in the array
a
.
The second line contains
2n
space-separated integers
a1
,
a2
,
…
,
a2n
(
1≤ai≤106
) — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
If there's no solution, print "-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, print a single line containing
2n
space-separated integers. They must form a reordering of
a
. You are allowed to not change the order.
Examples

3
1 2 2 1 3 1

Copy
2 1 3 1 1 2

1 1
output
Copy
-1
Note
In the first example, the first
n
elements have sum
2+1+3=6
while the last
n
elements have sum
1+1+2=4
. The sums aren't equal.
In the second example, there's no solution.
