th
bullet
(1≤i≤M) has power

This means that the

Once an enemy’s strength becomes less than or equal to
0, the enemy dies and its strength becomes
0.
Find the strength of all the enemies after all
M bullets are fired.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Initial strength of the enemies is
[51,84,24,19,77,10,34].
The power of the first bullet is
3 and the capacity is
2. This means that the first bullet reduces the strength of the first and second enemies by
3. The strength of the enemies after the first bullet is fired:
[48,81,24,19,77,10,34].
The power of the second bullet is
6 and the capacity is
2. This means that the second bullet reduces the strength of first and second enemies by
6. The strength of the enemies after the second bullet is fired:
[42,75,24,19,77,10,34].
The strength of enemies after third bullet is fired:
[39,72,21,16,74,7,34].
The strength of enemies after fourth bullet is fired:
[29,62,21,16,74,7,34].
Test case
2: Initial strength of the enemies is
[10,5,4,8].
The power of the first bullet is
4 and the capacity is
2. This means that the first bullet reduces the strength of the first and second enemies by
4. The strength of the enemies after the first bullet is fired:
[6,1,4,8].
The power of the second bullet is
2 and the capacity is
4. This means that the second bullet reduces the strength of the first four enemies by
2. The strength of the enemies after the second bullet is fired:
[4,0,2,6]. Note that due to this bullet, the second enemy dies and its strength becomes
0.
The power of the third bullet is
3 and the capacity is
2. This means that the third bullet reduces the strength of the first two alive enemies by
3. The strength of the enemies after the third bullet is fired:
[1,0,0,6]. Note that since the second enemy is already dead, enemies
1 and
3 are affected by this bullet.
