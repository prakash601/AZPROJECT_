Gotham City is the home of Batman, and Batman likes to keep his people together.
There are
N houses in the city. The resident of the
i
th
house is of type
A
i
. It is known that people of the same type are friends and people of different types are not friends.
To maintain peace, Batman can do the following type of operation:
Choose indices
i and
j
(1≤i≤j≤N) and reverse the substring
A[i,j].
Determine the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most
k operations on the string for all
0≤k≤N.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of houses in Gotham city.
The next line contains a string
A with
N characters. The
i
th
character denotes the type of the
i
th
person.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line,
(N+1) space-separated integers where the
i
th
integer signifies the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most
i operations.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤2⋅10
5
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10
5
.
String
A contains lowercase English alphabets only.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All
4 people are friends. Thus, the answer is
4 for all values of
k.
Test case
2:
For
k=0, the length of the longest range of friends is
1.
For
k=1, we can choose
i=1 and
j=3. On reversing the substring
[1,3], we get cbaa. Thus, length of longest range of friends is
2.
For
k=2,3, and
4, the length of the longest range of friends is
2 as no more people of the same type can be grouped together.
