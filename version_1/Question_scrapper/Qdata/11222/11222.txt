At first, there was a legend related to the name of the problem, but now it's just a formal statement.
You are given
n
points
a1,a2,…,an
on the
OX
axis. Now you are asked to find such an integer point
x
on
OX
axis that
fk(x)
is minimal possible.
The function
fk(x)
can be described in the following way:
form a list of distances
d1,d2,…,dn
where
di=|ai−x|
(distance between
ai
and
x
);
sort list
d
in non-descending order;
take
dk+1
as a result.
If there are multiple optimal answers you can print any of them.
Input
The first line contains single integer
T
(
1≤T≤2⋅105
) — number of queries. Next
2⋅T
lines contain descriptions of queries. All queries are independent.
The first line of each query contains two integers
n
,
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
,
0≤k<n
) — the number of points and constant
k
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤a1<a2<⋯<an≤109
) — points in ascending order.
It's guaranteed that
∑n
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
Print
T
integers — corresponding points
x
which have minimal possible value of
fk(x)
. If there are multiple answers you can print any of them.
