Chefina has an array
A consisting of
N positive integers.
A permutation subsequence of length
M is a subsequence that represents a permutation of length
M.
Now, Chefina asks Chef to find the count of permutation subsequences in array
A. The count can be very large, so output it modulo
1000000007
(10
9
+7).
As a reminder:
A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A permutation of length
M is an array of length
M in which every element from
1 to
M occurs exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of array
A.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers, the elements of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the count of permutation subsequences in array
A, modulo
10
9
+7.
