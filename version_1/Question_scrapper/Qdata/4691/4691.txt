On her way to ChefLand, Marichka noticed
10
K
road signs (numbered
0 through
10
K
−1). For each valid
i, the sign with number
i had the integer
i written on one side and
10
K
−i−1 written on the other side.
Now, Marichka is wondering — how many road signs have exactly two distinct decimal digits written on them (on both sides in total)? Since this number may be large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
For example, if
K=3, the two integers written on the road sign
363 are
363 and
636, and they contain two distinct digits
3 and
6, but on the road sign
362, there are integers
362 and
637, which contain four distinct digits —
2,
3,
6 and
7. On the road sign
11, there are integers
11 and
988, which contain three distinct digits —
1,
9 and
8.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of road signs with exactly two digits, modulo
10
9
+7.
