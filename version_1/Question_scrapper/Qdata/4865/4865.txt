Chef has two integer sequences
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
. You should choose
N+M−1 pairs, each in the form
(A
x
,B
y
), such that the sums
A
x
+B
y
are all pairwise distinct.
It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

Output
Print
N+M−1 lines. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers
x and
y denoting that you chose a pair
(A
x+1
,B
y+1
).

Explanation:
The chosen pairs and their sums are:
A
3
+B
2
=100+3=103
A

+B
1
=10+4=14
A
2
+B

=1+4=5
A

=10+3=13
Since all sums are distinct, this is a correct output.
