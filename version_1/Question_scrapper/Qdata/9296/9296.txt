Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.
It's known that they have worked together on the same file for
n+m
minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already
k
lines written in the file.
Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.
Monocarp worked in total for
n
minutes and performed the sequence of actions
[a1,a2,…,an]
. If
ai=0
, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If
ai>0
, then he changes the line with the number
ai
. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order:
a1
, then
a2
, ...,
an
.
Polycarp worked in total for
m
minutes and performed the sequence of actions
[b1,b2,…,bm]
. If
bj=0
, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If
bj>0
, then he changes the line with the number
bj
. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order:
b1
, then
b2
, ...,
bm
.
Restore their common sequence of actions of length
n+m
such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence
[a1,a2,…,an]
and Polycarp's — subsequence
[b1,b2,…,bm]
. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.
Let's look at an example. Suppose
k=3
. Monocarp first changed the line with the number
2
and then added a new line (thus,
n=2,a=[2,0]
). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number
5
(thus,
m=2,b=[0,5]
).
Since the initial length of the file was
3
, in order for Polycarp to change line number
5
two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be
[0,2,0,5]
and
[2,0,0,5]
. Changes
[0,0,5,2]
(wrong order of actions) and
[0,5,2,0]
(line
5
cannot be edited yet) are not correct.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). Then
t
test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.
Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers
k
,
n
,
m
(
0≤k≤100
,
1≤n,m≤100
) — the initial number of lines in file and lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of changes respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤300
).
The third line contains
m
integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
0≤bj≤300
).
Output
For each test case print any correct common sequence of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions of length
n+m
or -1 if such sequence doesn't exist.
