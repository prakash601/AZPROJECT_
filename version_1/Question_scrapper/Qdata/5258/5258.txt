Chef has a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
; each element of this sequence is either
0 or
1. Appy gave him a string
S with length
Q describing a sequence of queries. There are two types of queries:
'!': right-shift the sequence
A, i.e. replace
A by another sequence
B
1

'?': find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of
A with length
≤K such that each element of this subsequence is equal to
1
Answer all queries of the second type.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers
N,
Q and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

.
The third line contains a string with length
Q describing queries. Each character of this string is either '?', denoting a query of the second type, or '!', denoting a query of the first type.
Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the longest required subsequence.

Explanation:
In the first query, there are two longest contiguous subsequences containing only
1-s:
A
1
,A
2
and
A
4
,A
5
. Each has length
2.
After the second query, the sequence
A is
[1,1,1,0,1].
In the third query, the longest contiguous subsequence containing only
1-s is
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
.
After the fourth query,
A=[1,1,1,1,0].
In the fifth query, the longest contiguous subsequence containing only
1-s is
A
1
,A
2
,A

,A

with length
4. However, we only want subsequences with lengths
≤K. One of the longest such subsequences is
A

, with length
