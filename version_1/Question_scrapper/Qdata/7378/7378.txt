There are two sequences
A
1
,A

,…,A
N
and
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
. Answer
Q queries on these sequences.
In each query, you should calculate the dot product of subsequences
A
x
,A
x+1
,…,A
x+l−1
and
B
y
,B
y+1
,…,B
y+l−1
, i.e. the value of the expression
∑
k=0
l−1
A
x+k
B
y+k
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A

,…,A
N
.
The third line contains
N space-separated integers
B

,…,B
N
.
Each of the following
Q lines contains three space-separated integers
x,
y and
l describing one query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the query (the dot product).
