You are given an array
A of length
2⋅N.
You also have an empty array
B. You are asked to do the following operation exactly
N times.
Choose two distinct indices
x and
y
(1≤x,y≤∣A∣);
Append
(A
x
−A
y
) to the end of array
B;
Delete the
x
th
and
y
th
elements from
A and concatenate remaining elements without changing the order.
Find whether there exists a set of operations to get array
B such that
B
i

=B
(i+1)
(1≤i<N).
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
2⋅N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
2⋅N
representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line the answer: YES if it is possible to obtain valid
B, and NO otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings Yes, YES, yes, yEs` will all be treated as identical.

Explanation:
Test case
1: No matter how we perform the operations,
B=[0,0].
Test case
2:
In first operation, we can take
x=2 and
y=3. Now we append
A
x
−A
y
=1−2=−1 at the back of
B, and delete
A
2
and
A
3
from
A. Now
A=[1,2,3,3].
In second operation, we can take
x=2 and
y=1; append
A
x
−A
y
=2−1=1 at the back of
B and delete
A
2
and
A
1
. Thus,
A=[3,3] and
B=[−1,1].
In the third operation, we take
x=1 and
y=2; append
A
x
−A
y
=3−3=0 at the back of
B and delete
A
1
and
A
2
. Thus,
A=[] and
B=[−1,1,0].
Thus, finally
B=[−1,1,0]. There are no two consecutive elements in
B that are equal.
Test case
3:
In first operation, we can take
x=2 and
y=3. Now we append
A
x
−A
y
=1−2=−1 at the back of
B, and delete
A
2
and
A
3
from
A. Now
A=[1,2].
In second operation, we can take
x=2 and
y=1; append
A
x
−A
y
=2−1=1 at the back of
B and delete
A
2
and
A
1
. Thus,
A=[] and
B=[−1,1].
Thus, finally
B=[−1,1]. There are no two consecutive elements in
B that are equal.
