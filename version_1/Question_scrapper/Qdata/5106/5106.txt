You are given an array
B of length
2N . You have an unknown array
A which is sorted and contains distinct elements. You need to find out the array
A.
B contains all the medians of each prefix and suffix of the array
A.
A median is the middle element in a sorted array .
[1,2,3,4] has median
2 and
[1,3,4] has
3 as median.
Determine whether
B is a valid array of some array
A. If yes find the array
A else print
−1.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
.
The second line of each test case contains
2N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each testcase, output the valid array
A or
−1 if not possible.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Assume the array
A be
[5,6,7]. The medians of the prefix arrays of
A are
[5] =
5
[5,6] =
5
[5,6,7] =
6
The medians of the suffix arrays of
A are
[7] =
7
[6,7] =
6
[5,6,7] =
6
Hence
B contains all the medians above with the element
5 repeating exactly
2 times,
6 repeating exactly
3 times and
7 repeating only once.
Test case
2: no valid array
A can be found.
