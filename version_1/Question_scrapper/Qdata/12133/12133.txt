Let the main characters of this problem be personages from some recent movie. New Avengers seem to make a lot of buzz. I didn't watch any part of the franchise and don't know its heroes well, but it won't stop me from using them in this problem statement. So, Thanos and Dr. Strange are doing their superhero and supervillain stuff, but then suddenly they stumble across a regular competitive programming problem.
You are given a tree with
n
vertices.
In each vertex
v
there is positive integer
av
.
You have to answer
q
queries.
Each query has a from
u
v
x
.
You have to calculate
∏w∈Pgcd(x,aw)mod(109+7)
, where
P
is a set of vertices on path from
u
to
v
. In other words, you are to calculate the product of
gcd(x,aw)
for all vertices
w
on the path from
u
to
v
. As it might be large, compute it modulo
109+7
. Here
gcd(s,t)
denotes the greatest common divisor of
s
and
t
.
Note that the numbers in vertices do not change after queries.
I suppose that you are more interested in superhero business of Thanos and Dr. Strange than in them solving the problem. So you are invited to solve this problem instead of them.
Input
In the first line of input there is one integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the size of the tree.
In the next
n−1
lines the edges of the tree are described. The
i
-th edge is described with two integers
ui
and
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
) and it connects the vertices
ui
and
vi
. It is guaranteed that graph with these edges is a tree.
In the next line there are
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤av≤107
).
In the next line there is one integer
q
(
1≤q≤105
) — the number of queries.
And in the next
q
lines the queries are described. Each query is described with three integers
ui
,
vi
and
xi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
,
1≤xi≤107
).
Output
Print
q
numbers — the answers to the queries in the order they are given in the input. Print each answer modulo
109+7=1000000007
. Print each number on a separate line.
