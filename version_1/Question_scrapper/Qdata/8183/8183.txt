The score of an array
v1,v2,…,vn
is defined as the number of indices
i
(
1≤i≤n
) such that
v1+v2+…+vi=0
.
You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
of length
n
. You can perform the following operation multiple times:
select an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) such that
ai=0
;
then replace
ai
by an arbitrary integer.
What is the maximum possible score of
a
that can be obtained by performing a sequence of such operations?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
) — array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print the maximum possible score of the array
a
after performing a sequence of operations.

Note
In the first test case, it is optimal to change the value of
a2
to
−2
in one operation.
The resulting array
a
will be
[2,−2,1,−1,0]
, with a score of
3
:
a1+a2=2−2=0
;
a1+a2+a3+a4=2−2+1−1=0
;
a1+a2+a3+a4+a5=2−2+1−1+0=0
.
In the second test case, it is optimal to change the value of
a3
to
−2000000000
, giving us an array with a score of
1
.
In the third test case, it is not necessary to perform any operations.
