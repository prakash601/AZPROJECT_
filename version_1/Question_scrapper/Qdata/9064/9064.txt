Theofanis has a riddle for you and if you manage to solve it, he will give you a Cypriot snack halloumi for free (Cypriot cheese).
You are given an integer
n
. You need to find two integers
l
and
r
such that
−1018≤l<r≤1018
and
l+(l+1)+…+(r−1)+r=n
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1018
).
Output
For each test case, print the two integers
l
and
r
such that
−1018≤l<r≤1018
and
l+(l+1)+…+(r−1)+r=n
.
It can be proven that an answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the first test case,
0+1=1
.
In the second test case,
(−1)+0+1+2=2
.
In the fourth test case,
1+2+3=6
.
In the fifth test case,
18+19+20+21+22=100
.
In the sixth test case,
(−2)+(−1)+0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=25
.
