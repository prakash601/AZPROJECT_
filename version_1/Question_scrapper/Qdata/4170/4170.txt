Dazzler has a blank canvas and
(N−1) colours numbered from
2 to
N.
Let
B denote the beauty of the canvas. The beauty of a blank canvas is
1.
Dazzler paints the canvas by using all the
(N−1) colours exactly once. On applying the
i
th
colour
(2≤i≤N):
If
i is odd,
B=B
&
i.
If
i is even,
B=B⊕i.
Find the beauty of the canvas after applying all
(N−1) colours.
Note: The colours are applied in ascending order. Colour number
2 is applied first. The
i
th
numbered colour is applied after
(i−1)
th
numbered colour for all
i>2.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer, the beauty of the canvas after applying all
(N−1) colours.

Explanation:
Initially,
B=1.
On applying colour
2: Since
2 is even,
B=B⊕2=1⊕2=3.
On applying colour
3: Since
3 is odd,
B=B&3=3&3=3.
On applying colour
4: Since
4 is even,
B=B⊕4=3⊕4=7.
On applying colour
5: Since
5 is odd,
B=B&5=7&5=5.
On applying colour
6: Since
6 is even,
B=B⊕6=5⊕6=3.
On applying colour
7: Since
7 is odd,
B=B&7=3&7=3.
On applying colour
8: Since
8 is even,
B=B⊕8=3⊕8=11.
On applying colour
9: Since
9 is odd,
B=B&9=11&9=9.
On applying colour
10: Since
10 is even,
B=B⊕10=9⊕10=3.
Test case
1: There are
3 colours numbered
2,3, and
4. Initially,
B=1.
The final beauty of the canvas is
7.
Test case
2: There are
9 colours numbered
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and
10. Initially,
B=1.
The final beauty of the canvas is
3.
