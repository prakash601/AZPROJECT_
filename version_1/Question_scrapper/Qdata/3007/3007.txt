X = 9
Output:
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function sortedInsert() that takes head reference and x as arguments and returns the head of the modified list. The printing and checking tasks are done by the driver code.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 103
