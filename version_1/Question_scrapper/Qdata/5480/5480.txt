Bob has a string (S), which is initially empty. In one operation, he can select a lowercase character (a-z) uniformly at random and appends it to S. He then evaluates whether S is a palindrome or not; if it is, he gets 1 point.
Given that Bob performs N operations in total, find the expected no. of points Bob gets.
It is guaranteed that the answer can always be represented as a rational number
b
a
. You must print this number modulo 1000000007. By this we mean that you must print,
a×b
−1
modulo 1000000007 where
b
−1
denotes the modulo inverse of
b with respect to 1000000007.
Also observe that 1000000007 is a prime number.
Input
First line of the input will contain T denoting the number of test-cases.For every test case, first line will contain N.
Output
• For every test case, print the required answer in a separate line % 10^9+7.

Explanation:
For n = 2, the answer is 27/26 points.
We have to print this number modulo 1000000007 which equals 27 * 26
−1
% 1000000007 = 576923082.
