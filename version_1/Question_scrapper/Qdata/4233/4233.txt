Consider the following
4×4 pattern:
 1  2  4  7
 3  5  8 11
 6  9 12 14
10 13 15 16
You are given an integer
N. Print the
N×N pattern of the same kind (containing integers
1 through
N
2
).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print
N lines; each of them should contain
N space-separated integers.
