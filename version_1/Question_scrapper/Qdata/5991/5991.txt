Chef likes sequences of integers and in particular, he likes arithmetic progressions.
There are two integers
N and
K. Chef wants to choose a starting positive integer
A, create the sequence
(A,A+K,A+2⋅K,…,A+(N−1)⋅K) and compute the product of all elements of this sequence; let's denote this product by
X. For example, if
N=3 and
K=2, then Chef can create the sequence
(4,6,8), for which
X=192.
Find the largest integer that divides
X regardless of the value of
A that Chef chooses. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10
9
+7).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the largest number that always divides
X, modulo
1,000,000,007.

Explanation:
Example case 1: If Chef chooses
A=1, the sequence he creates is
(1,3) and then,
X is
3, and if he chooses
A=2, the sequence is
(2,4) and
X is
8. We can see that the largest integer that divides them both is
1.
Example case 2: The product of any
3 consecutive integers is always divisible by
6.
