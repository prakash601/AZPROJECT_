Given an integer array of N elements. You need to find the maximum sum of two elements such that sum is closest to zero.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {-8 -66 -60}
Output: -68
Explanation: Sum of two elements closest to 
zero is -68 using numbers -60 and -8.
Example 2:
Input: 
N = 6
arr[] = {-21 -67 -37 -18 4 -65}
Output: -14
Explanation: Sum of two elements closest to
zero is -14 using numbers -18 and 4.
Note : In Case if we have two of more ways to form sum of two elements closest to zero return the maximum sum.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. You just need to complete the function closestToZero() which takes an array arr[] and its size n as inputs and returns the maximum sum closest to zero that can be formed by summing any two elements in the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 5 * 105
-106 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
