Let
f be a function, such that, for an array
A of size
M,
f(A) is defined as
$f(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{M}\sum_{j=1, j \ne i}^{j=M} (A_i\cdot A_j)$
You are given an array
C of size
N. In one operation on the array, you can:
Choose an index
i
(1≤i≤∣C∣)
Select two positive integers
X and
Y such that
X+Y=C
i
Remove the element
C
i
from the array
C
Insert the elements
X and
Y to the array
C
Find the maximum value of
f(C) that can be obtained using any (possibly zero) number of given operations. Since this value can be huge, output the answer modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, denoting the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum value of
f(C) that can be obtained using any (possibly zero) number of given operations. Since this value can be huge, output the answer modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Using one operation, we choose
i=2, set
X=1 and
Y=1, remove
2 from the array, and insert
X and
Y. Thus, the final array is
C=[1,1,1].
Here,

Test case
2:
Operation
1: We choose
i=2, set
X=1 and
Y=2, remove
3 from the array, and insert
X and
Y. Thus, the final array is
C=[1,1,2].
Operation
2: We choose
i=3, set
X=1 and
Y=1, remove
3 from the array, and insert
X and
Y. Thus, the final array is
C=[1,1,1,1].
Here,
f(C)=12.
