You should answer
Q queries. In each query, you are given a range
[f,t]. Consider the points
(x

,y
f
),(x
f+1
,y

),…,(x
t
,y
t
); the answer to a query is the square of the maximum Euclidean distance between any two of these points.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
i
and
i
.
The next line contains a single integer
Q.
Each of the next
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
f and
t describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the squared maximum distance.
