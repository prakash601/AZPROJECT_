An input string
S of length
N is transferred through the network using a special protocol. The protocol can send the string through a series of operations. In one operation, we can choose a lowercase english alphabet
C and do one of the following:
Transfer
1 copy of
C through the network.
Transfer
2 copies of
C through the network.
Each of the above transfers take
1 unit of time.
Find the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string
S through the network.
Input Format
The first line will contain
- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains
N - the length of the string
S.
Second line of each test case contains the string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to transfer the string.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤10
5
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10

.
String
S contains lowercase english alphabets only.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: String can be transferred through following operations: send
1 copy of character
c, send
1 copy of character
b, send
1 copy of character
c, send
1 copy of character
d, and send
1 copy of character
c. Thus, total
5 operations are required.
Test Case
2: String can be transferred through following operations: send
2 copies of character
a, send
1 copy of character
b, send
1 copy of character
e, and send
2 copies of character
e. Thus, total
4 operations are required.
