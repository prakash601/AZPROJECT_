You have an infinitely long digital panel. Using various combinations of
7 segments, we can represent each digit. The picture shows how all
10 decimal digits are displayed.
Initially, all segments in the panel are off. You are given seven integers
A,B,C,D,E,F and
G representing the number of coins required to turn on the respective segment, as shown above.
Given an integer
N, find the minimum number of coins you need to spend to display some of
N on the panel.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains eight space-separated integers
N,A,B,C,D,E,F and
G, denoting the integer
N and the number of coins required to turn on each of the seven segments.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer - the minimum number of coins you need to spend to display some factor of
N on the panel.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
10 has four factors:
1,
2,
5, and
10. Their costs are:
Display
1:
31+21=52.
Display
2:
1+31+5+3+9=49.
Display
5:
1+21+5+12+9=48.
Display
10:
31+21+1+31+21+5+3+12=125.
The minimum number of coins are required to display
5, which costs
48 coins.
Test case
2:
69697 has two factors:
1 and
69697. The cost to display
1 is only
5 coins, while the cost to display
69697 is much larger, so the answer is
5.
