Given a string S containing only digits, Your task is to complete the function genIp() which returns a vector containing all possible combinations of valid IPv4 IP addresses and takes only a string S as its only argument.
Note: Order doesn't matter. A valid IP address must be in the form of A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers from 0-255. The numbers cannot be 0 prefixed unless they are 0.


For string 11211 the IP address possible are 
1.1.2.11
1.1.21.1
1.12.1.1
11.2.1.1
Example 1:
Input:
S = 1111
1.1.1.1
Example 2:
Input:
S = 55
Output: -1

Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function genIp() which returns a vector containing all possible combinations of valid IPv4 IP addresses or -1 if no such IP address could be generated through the input string S, the only argument to the function.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N * N * N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N * N * N * N)
Constraints:
1<=N<=16
here, N = length of S.
S only contains digits(i.e. 0-9)
