Find the
K-th term of this sequence.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
A,B,C,K — the first three terms of the sequence, and the index of the term that you have to find.
For each test case, output on a new line the
K-th term of the corresponding sequence.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: The sequence is
(16,12,9,7,5,4,3,2,…). It can be seen that the eighth term is
2.
