Chef has an array
A of
N numbers. He also has
N functions. The
i
th
function will return the sum of all
A
j
where (
L
i
≤j≤R
i
). You have to answer
Q queries of two types:
1
x
y - Change the
x
th
element of the array to
y.
2
l
r - Print the sum of all functions from
l to
r.
Can you solve this problem?
Input
First line contains a single integer -
N, the length of the array and the number of functions
Next line contains
N space separated integers, the
i
th
of which is
A
i
The next N lines each contain two space separated integers, the
i
th
line contains
L
i
and
R
i
.
The next line contains a single integer
Q
The next
Q lines contain queries in the format described aboce.
Output
For each query of type
2, output the answer on a separate line.

Explanation
Functions values initially :
F[1]=1+2+3=6
F[2]=2+3+4+5=14
F[3]=4+5=9
F[4]=3+4+5=12
F[5]=1+2=3
Query
1:F[1]+F[2]+F[3]+F[4]=41
After the update , the functions are :
F[1] = 10
F[2] = 18
F[3] = 9
F[4] = 16
F[5] = 3
Query
3:F[1]+F[2]+F[3]+F[4]=53
