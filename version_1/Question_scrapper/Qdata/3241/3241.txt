Given a string 'str' of size ‘n’. The task is to remove or delete the minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is a palindrome. Find the minimum numbers of characters we need to remove.
Note: The order of characters should be maintained.
Example 1:
Input: n = 7, str = "aebcbda"
Output: 2
Explanation: We'll remove 'e' and
'd' and the string become "abcba".
â€‹Example 2:
Input: n = 3, str = "aba"
Output: 0
Explanation: We don't remove any
character.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minDeletions() which takes the string s and length of s as inputs and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|str|2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |str| ≤ 103
