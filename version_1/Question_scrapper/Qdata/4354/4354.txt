Chef Tobby is playing a rapid fire with Bhuvan. He gives Bhuvan a string S and each time, Bhuvan has to guess whether there exists 2 equal subsequences in the string or not.
Bhuvan got a perfect score in the game with Chef Tobby. However, Chef Tobby has now asked Bhuvan to write a program that will do this automatically given a string S. Bhuvan is an intelligent man but he does not know how to write a code. Can you help him?
Find two different subsequences such that they are equal in their value, more formally, find two sequences of indices (a, a, ..., a, a) and (b, b, ..., b, bk) such that:
1≤ ai, bi ≤ |S|
ai < ai+1 for all valid i
bi < bi+1 for all valid i
Sai = Sbi for all valid i
there exist at least one i such that ai is not equal to bi
Input section
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contain one string S each.
Input will only consist of lowercase english characters
Output section
For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) as the solution to the problem.
Input constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 100

Explanation:
In test case 2, one of the possible equal subsequence is "vi" and "vi". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 7}, assuming 0-based indexing).
In test case 4, one of the possible equal subsequence is "ce" and "ce". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 6}, assuming 0-based indexing).
