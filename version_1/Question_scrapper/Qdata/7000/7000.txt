For a given array
B, we can divide the array into
2 non-empty subsequences, such that, each element of the array is present in exactly one of the subsequences.
Let
X and
Y denote the GCD of all elements of the first and second subsequence respectively.
We define the maximum diversity of the array
B as:
MXDV(B)=max(X−Y), over all possible pairs of subsequences.
Given an array
A of
N non-negative integers and a non-negative integer
K, find the length of the smallest subarray
S of array
A such that
MXDV(S)≥K.
If no such subarray exists, print
−1.
Input Format
First line contains
T − the number of test cases. The description of the test cases is as follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N,
K − the length of array
A and the value of
K.
The second line of each test case contains
N integers
A

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer − the length of the smallest subarray
S of array
A such that
MXDV(S)≥K. If no such subarray exists, print
−1.

Explanation:
Test case
1: One possible subarray
S can be
[3,9] and the subsequences thus formed can be
[9],
[3]. The value of
X−Y=9−3=6. It can be shown that this is the smallest array for which
MXDV(S)=6≥5.
Test case
2: One of the possible subarray
S can be
[10,3,9] and the subsequences thus formed can be
[9],
[10,3]. The value of
X−Y=9−1=8. It can be proven that there is no subarray
S with less than
3 elements which can have
MXDV(S)=8≥8.
