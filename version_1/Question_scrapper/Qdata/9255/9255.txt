You have an array
a
consisting of
n
distinct positive integers, numbered from
1
to
n
. Define
pk
as
pk=
∑
1≤i,j≤k
aimodaj,
where
xmody
denotes the remainder when
x
is divided by
y
. You have to find and print
p1,p2,…,pn
.
Input
The first line contains
n
— the length of the array (
2≤n≤2⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
space-separated distinct integers
a1,…,an
(
1≤ai≤3⋅105
,
ai≠aj
if
i≠j
).
Output
Print
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
.
