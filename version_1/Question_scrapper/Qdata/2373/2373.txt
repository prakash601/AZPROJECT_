Given a string, check if all its characters are the same or not.
Example 1:
Input:
s = "geeks"
Output: False

character 'g', 'e', 'k' and 's'.
Example 2:
Input: 
s = "gggg"
Output: True

character 'g'.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function check() which takes a string as input and returns True if all the characters in the string are the same. Else, it returns False.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 104
