Pasha has a string
A, of length
N, and an integer
K.
Consider a string
B of length
M. A character
c in string
B is said to be good, if the difference between the total occurrences of
c and the total remaining characters in
B (other than
c), is equal to
K.
Formally, if
freq(c, B) denotes the frequency of character
c in string
B of length
M, then, the following condition should hold true for
c to be good:
freq(c, B)−(M−freq(c, B))=2⋅
freq(c, B)−M=K
Pasha ordered you to find the sum of count of good characters across all substrings of string
A.
Note that a substring is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of the string and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of the string.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the length of string
A and an integer as defined in statement, respectively.
The second line contains a string
A consisting of
N lowercase english alphabets.
Output Format
For each test case, output the sum of count of good characters across all substrings of string
A.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider all the substrings of
A:
For substrings of length
1, for each character, the value of
2⋅
freq(c, B)−M=2⋅1−1=1

=K.
For substrings of length
3, for each character, the value of
2⋅
freq(c, B)−M=2⋅1−3=−1

=K.
For substring of length
4, for each character, the value of
2⋅
freq(c, B)−M=2⋅1−4=−2

=K.
In the substring
ab, for both characters
a and
b, the frequency is
1 and
2⋅1−2=0. The same satisfies for both characters of substring
bc and substring
cd.
Thus, each substring of length
2 has
2 good characters each. The sum of count of good characters is
2+2+2=6.
Test case
2: In this case, only the substrings of length
3 have good characters:
Consider
B as
aba. Here
b is a good character, as
2⋅
freq(b, B)−M=2⋅1−3=−1.
Consider
B as
bac. Here, all characters are good characters since the frequency is
1 for all characters and
2⋅1−3=−1.
The sum of count of good characters is
1+3=4.
Test case
3: In this case,
All the substrings of length
1 have good characters.
Consider
B as
aab. Here
a is a good character, as
2⋅
freq(a, B)−M=2⋅2−3=1.
The sum of count of good characters is
3+1=4.
