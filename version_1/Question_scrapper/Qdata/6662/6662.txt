Chef has a sequence
A of
2⋅N integers containing all natural numbers from
1 to
N exactly twice.
Let a sequence
B containing
K elements be a subsequence of
A. We define a strictly increasing index sequence
I(B)=[I
1
,I
2
,…,I
K
] such that,
B can be written as
[A
I
1
,A
I
2
,…,A

].
A pair of subsequences
(P,Q) is said to be good if all of the following conditions satisfy:
Both subsequences have the same length. In other words,
∣P∣=∣Q∣, where
∣P∣ and
∣Q∣ denote the lengths of
P and
Q respectively;
The subsequences
P and
Q are disjoint. In other words, there are no common elements between
I(P) and
I(Q);
The subsequences are equal. In other words,
j
j
for all
.
Find the total number of distinct ordered pairs of subsequences
(P,Q) that are good.
Two ordered pairs
(P
1
,Q
1
) and
(P
2
,Q
2
) are considered different iff
I(P
1
)

=I(P
2
) or
I(Q
1
)

=I(Q
2
).
Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
First line contains
T − the number of test cases. The description of the test cases is as follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N − the value of
N.
The second line of each test case contains
2⋅N integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
2⋅N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer − the total number of distinct ordered pairs of subsequences
(P,Q) that are good modulo
998244353.
