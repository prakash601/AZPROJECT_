You are given a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. This sequence is circular ― for each valid
i, the element
A
i+1
follows after
A
i
, and the element
A
1
follows after
A
N
.
You may insert any positive integers at any positions you choose in this sequence; let's denote the resulting sequence by
B. This sequence is also circular. For each pair of its elements
B
s
and
B
f
, let's denote the (non-circular) sequence created by starting at
B
s
and moving from each element to the one that follows after it, until we reach
B
f
, by
B(s,f). This sequence includes the elements
B
s
and
B
f
.
For each
K from
2 to
N inclusive, find the smallest possible number of elements that need to be inserted into
A to form a sequence
B for which there is no subsequence
B(p,q) such that:
The size of
B(p,q) is at least
K.
There is no pair of consecutive elements in
B(p,q) such that their GCD is equal to
1.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N−1 space-separated integers. For each
i (
1≤i≤N−1), the
i-th of these integers should be the smallest number of inserted elements in a valid sequence
B for
K=i+1.
