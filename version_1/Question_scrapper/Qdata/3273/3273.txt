Given a circular linked list, your task is to complete the method printList() that prints the linked list.
Input:
The printList function takes a single argument as input the reference pointer to the head of the linked list.
There are multiple test cases and for each test, the function will be called separately. 
Output: You just need to print the LinkedList in the same line and the next line will be added by the Driver Code.
Example:
Input:
2
7
374 363 171 497 282 306 426
2
162 231
Note : Input items are inserted at the front of linked list that is why output is in reverse order.
Constraints:
1<=T<=50
1<=N<=50
