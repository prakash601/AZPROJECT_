For a non-empty array
C containing positive integers, let
B be a subsequence of array
C of size
M
(1≤M≤∣C∣). We are going to play a drawing game based on the sequence
B:
Select
M points with positive integer coordinates on the
XY
− plane such that the points
(B
i
,0),
(0,B
i
) and the
i
th
selected point are collinear. Please note that multiple selected points can have the same coordinates.
Next, draw
M line segments. The
i
th
line segment should connect the origin
(0,0) with the
i
th
selected point.
The beauty of a line segment is equal to the number of points on the line segment that have integer coordinates. We want to maximize the sum of beauty over all line segments.
Let
W(B) denote the number of ways to select
M points based on the sequence
B such that the sum of beauty over all line segments is maximized. Let
S be the sum of
W(B) over all non-empty subsequences
B of the array
C.
You are given an array
A of size
N and
Q queries. In each query:
L
R : Given two integers
L and
R
(1≤L≤R≤N), define the array
C by keeping some elements in the range
A
L…R
and deleting the rest of the elements from
A without changing the order. Find out the number of distinct values of
S you can obtain over all the arrays
C.
Note that the array
C cannot be empty. In other words, you must keep at least one element from the range
A
L…R
.
Since this number can be quite large, output your answer modulo
10

+7.
Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N positive integers
A

N
where
A
i
is the
i
th
integer of the array
A.
Each of the next
Q lines contains two integers
L
j
and
R
j
denoting the
j
th
query.
Output Format
For each query, print the number of distinct values of
S you can obtain, if you can keep some elements in the range
A
L…R
and then delete the rest from
A without changing the order modulo
(10

Explanation:
Query
1: Given
L=1 and
R=3, the possible arrays
C made using the subarray
A[1,3] are:
C=[2]: The only possible subsequence
B=[2]. The only point collinear with
(2,0) and
(0,2) that has positive integer coordinates is
(1,1).
The line segment connecting origin with the selected point
(1,1) can be denoted by the line
y=−x+2.
The number of points lying on this line segment that have integer coordinates are
(0,0) and
(1,1). Thus, the beauty is
2.
There is only one way to maximize the beauty, thus the value of
W(B)=1.
Since there is only one possible subsequence, the value of
S is also
1.
C=[3]:S=2
C=[4]:S=1
C=[2,3]:S=5
C=[2,4]:S=3
C=[3,4]:S=5
C=[2,3,4]:S=11
There are
5 distinct values of
S, which are
{1,2,3,5,11}.
