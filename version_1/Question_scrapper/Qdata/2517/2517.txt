Given an array arr of N integers and an integer K, find the number of subsets of arr having XOR of elements as K.
  Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
k = 6
arr: 6 9 4 2
Output:
2
Explanation:
The subsets are 
{4,2} and {6}
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
K = 4
arr: 1 2 3 4 5
Output:
4
Explanation:
The subsets are {1, 5},
{4}, {1, 2, 3, 4},
and {2, 3, 5}

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function subsetXOR() which takes the array arr[], its size N, and an integer K as input parameters and returns the number of subsets having xor as K
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N*M)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N*M)
Note: M = maximum value any XOR subset will acquire
  Constraints:
1<=N<=20
1<=K<=100
0<=arr[i]<=100
