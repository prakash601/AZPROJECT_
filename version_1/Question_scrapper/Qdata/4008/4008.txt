You notice that you only ever score a boundary on the
M
th
ball, if
N
mod
M≤N/2, where
N is the lucky number of your T-shirt. Now you wanna know how many boundaries will you hit in total?
Formally, you are given a positive integer
N and you need to find the number of positive integers
M such that
N
mod
M≤N/2.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, which denotes the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.
The first and the only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print in a new line, the number of integers
M which follow the above condition.

Explanation:
For
N=3,
N
mod
M≤N/2 only for
M=1,2,3. Hence, the number of possible values of
M are 3.
