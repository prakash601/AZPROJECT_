This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version
n≤2000
. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
There are
n
potions in a line, with potion
1
on the far left and potion
n
on the far right. Each potion will increase your health by
ai

ai
can be negative, meaning that potion will decrease will health.
You start with
0
