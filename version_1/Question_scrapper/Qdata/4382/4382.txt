Eidi gifts are a tradition in which children receive money from elder relatives during the Eid celebration.
Chef has three children (numbered
1,2,3) and he wants to give them Eidi gifts. The oldest child, Chefu, thinks that a distribution of money is fair only if an older child always receives more money than a younger child; if two children have the same age, they should receive the same amounts of money.
For each valid
i, the
i-th child is
A
i
years old and it received
C
i
units of money. Determine whether this distribution of money is fair.

Explanation:
Example case 2: All children have same age which is 5, but second child got less money than the other children, so it's not fair.
Example case 3: First child is older than second child but he got less money than him, so it's not fair.
Example case 4: First and third children have same age, but didn't get same amount of money, so it's not fair.
