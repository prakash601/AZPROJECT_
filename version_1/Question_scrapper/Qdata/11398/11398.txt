An array of integers
p1,p2,…,pn
is called a permutation if it contains each number from
1
to
n
exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations:
[3,1,2]
,
[1]
,
[1,2,3,4,5]
and
[4,3,1,2]
. The following arrays are not permutations:
[2]
,
[1,1]
,
[2,3,4]
.
Polycarp invented a really cool permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
of length
n
. It is very disappointing, but he forgot this permutation. He only remembers the array
q1,q2,…,qn−1
of length
n−1
, where
qi=pi+1−pi
.
Given
n
and
q=q1,q2,…,qn−1
, help Polycarp restore the invented permutation.
Input
The first line contains the integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the permutation to restore. The second line contains
n−1
integers
q1,q2,…,qn−1
(
−n<qi<n
).
Output
Print the integer -1 if there is no such permutation of length
n
which corresponds to the given array
q
. Otherwise, if it exists, print
p1,p2,…,pn
. Print any such permutation if there are many of them.
