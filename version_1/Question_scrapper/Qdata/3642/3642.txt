There is a cricket match in Chefland. Chef's team requires
N runs to win in
M overs.
Given that
1 over consists of
6 balls and a player can score a maximum of
6 runs in a ball, find whether Chef's team can win.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of runs required to win the game and the remaining number of overs.
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef's team can win the game. Otherwise, output NO.
You can print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example NO, no, No, and nO are all considered identical.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1000
1≤M≤100

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef's team requires
500 runs to win. If they hit
6 runs on every ball for
13 overs, they will score
6⋅6⋅13=468 runs.
In the
14
th
over they can hit
6 runs in the first five balls and
2 runs in the sixth ball to get a total of
468+6⋅5+2=500 runs.
Thus, Chef's team can win the game.
Test case
2: Since
100 is greater than the maximum runs that can be scored
2 overs, it is not possible for Chef's team to win the game.
Test case
3: Since
30 is less than the maximum runs that can be scored in
1 over, it is possible for Chef's team to win the game.
Test case
4: Since
216 is equal to the maximum runs that can be scored in
6 overs, it is possible for Chef's team to win the game.
