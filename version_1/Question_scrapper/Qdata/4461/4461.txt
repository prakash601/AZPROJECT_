Mr. Pr and Ms. Ad are at
a and
b respectively on an infinite number line. Mr. Pr wants to meet Ms. Ad.
Mr. Pr can choose to move
c or
d units in 1 second. If Mr. Pr moves
c units then Ms. Ad will move
d units and vice versa. (Both of them always moved in positive x-direction)
You have to determine if Mr. Pr can meet with Ms. Ad after some integral amount of time, given that Mr. Pr chooses optimally. Note that meeting after a fractional amount of time does not count.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains four space separated integers,
a,
b,
c, and
d.
###Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if Mr. Pr meets with Ms. Ad, otherwise "NO".
###Constraints

YES
NO
Explanation:
In the first test case, Mr. Pr will move 2 units in the first second and Ms. Ad moves 1 unit simultaneously and they meet.
In the second test case, it is impossible to meet (fractional time is not allowed).
