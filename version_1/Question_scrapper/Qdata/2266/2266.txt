Given an array A of size N, your task is to do some operations, i.e., search an element x, insert an element y at index yi, and delete an element z by completing the functions. Also, all functions should return a boolean value.
Note: 
In delete operation return true even if element is not present.
N is never greater than 10000.
Input Format:
N
A1 A2 . . . An
x y yi z
Example:
Input:
5
2 4 1 0 6

Output:
1 1 1
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you only need to complete the provided functions.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= Ai <= 1000
