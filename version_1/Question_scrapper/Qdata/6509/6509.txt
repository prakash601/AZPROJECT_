You are given an array
A consisting of
N distinct positive integers.
Find the smallest positive integer
d such that there exists no pair of integers
(i,j)
(1≤i<j≤N) where
abs(A
i
−A
j
) is divisible by
d.
In other words,
d∤abs(A
i
−A
j
) for all
(1≤i<j≤N).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integers
N — the number of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
space-separated distinct integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the smallest positive integer
d such that
d∤(A
i
−A
j
) for all
(1≤i<j≤N).
