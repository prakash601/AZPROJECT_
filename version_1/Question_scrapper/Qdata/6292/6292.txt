Chef has a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N). The tree is rooted at the vertex
1. For each valid
i, the weight of the
i-th vertex is
w
i
.
For a vertex
u with depth
d (the root has depth
1), let's denote the sequence of vertices on the path from
u to the root by
(v
1
,v
2
,…,v
d
), where
v
1
=u and
v
d
=1. Then, let
F
u
be the vector (i.e. sequence)
(w
v
1
,w
v
2
,…,w
v
d
), where the
i-th element is
F
u,i
=w
v
i
for each valid
i.
For any two vertices
u and
v with the same depth
d, let's define the dot product
F
u
⋅F
v
=∑
i=1
d
F
u,i
⋅F
v,i
.
Your task is to answer
Q queries. In each query, you are given two vertices
u and
v with the same depth, and you should find
F
u
⋅F
v
. Since the dot product can be large, compute it modulo
2
32
.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
w
1
,w
2
,…,w
N
.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that vertices
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer
F
u
⋅F
v
modulo
2
32
.

Explanation:
In the first query,
F
2
=(4,5) and
F
3
=(3,5), so the scalar product is
4⋅3+5⋅5=37.
In the second query,
F
4
=(2,4,5) and
F
5
=(1,4,5), so the scalar product is
2⋅1+4⋅4+5⋅5=43.
