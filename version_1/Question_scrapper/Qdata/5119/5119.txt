Chef made
N pieces of cakes, numbered them
1 through
N and arranged them in a row in this order. There are
K possible types of flavours (numbered
1 through
K); for each valid
i, the
i-th piece of cake has a flavour
A
i
.
Chef wants to select a contiguous subsegment of the pieces of cake such that there is at least one flavour which does not occur in that subsegment. Find the maximum possible length of such a subsegment of cakes.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum length of a valid subsegment.
