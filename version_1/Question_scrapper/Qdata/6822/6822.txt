In the problem CHEFRUN, Chef and Kefa were looking for a secret recipe. Their adventure continues here!
It turned out that the recipe has three pieces. They already have the first piece of the recipe, but the other two pieces are located at the coast of lake Piecal opposite to them.
The lake can be represented as a rectangular grid with
N rows and
M columns. Some cells of the grid are filled with water, other cells contain big stones.
In order to avoid wasting time, the cooks have agreed that their paths must not intersect and neither of them can visit any cell twice. From each cell, a boat can move one cell up, down or right (if a cell in that direction exists); of course, the boats can't enter the cells with stones.
Your task is to find the number of ways in which Chef and Kefa can obtain the full recipe (the number of pairs of their paths across the lake), modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The following
N lines describe the grid. Each of these lines contains a single string with length
M containing only characters '.' (representing water) or '#' (representing stones).
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible ways to get the recipe modulo
10
9
+7.
Constraints
1≤T≤3
2≤N,M≤300
all corner cells do not contain stones
