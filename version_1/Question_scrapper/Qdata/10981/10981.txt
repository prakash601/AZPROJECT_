You are given a sequence
a1,a2,…,an
consisting of
n
non-zero integers (i.e.
ai≠0
).
You have to calculate two following values:
the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(l≤r)
such that
al⋅al+1…ar−1⋅ar
is negative;
the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(l≤r)
such that
al⋅al+1…ar−1⋅ar
is positive;
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(1≤n≤2⋅105)
— the number of elements in the sequence.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(−109≤ai≤109;ai≠0)
— the elements of the sequence.
Output
Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.
