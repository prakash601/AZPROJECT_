There is a town with
N people and initially, the
i
th
person has
A
i
coins. However, some people of the town decide to become monks. If the
i
th
person becomes a monk, then:
He leaves the town thereby reducing the number of people in the town by
1.
He distributes
X
(0≤X≤A
i
) coins to the remaining people of the town (not necessarily equally). Note that each monk can freely choose his value of
X, and different monks may choose different values of
X.
He takes the remaining
A
i
−X coins with him.
For example, initially, if
A=[1,3,4,5] and
4
th
person decides to become a monk then he can leave the town and can give
2 coins to the
1
st
person,
1 coin to the
2
nd
person, no coins to the
3
rd
person and take
2 coins along with him while going. Now
becomes
[3,4,4].
Determine the minimum number of people who have to become monks, so that in the end, everyone remaining in the town has an equal number of coins.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All the people already have an equal number of coins.
Test case
2: The
2
nd
person can become a monk and give his
1 coin to the person with
4 coins. After this, both the remaining people will have
5 coins.
Test case
3: One way of two people becoming monks is as follows:
The
2
nd
person becomes a monk, and takes his
1 coin with him
The
3
rd
person becomes a monk, and gives one coin each to the
4
th
and
5
th
people
Everyone remaining in the town now has
2 coins.
