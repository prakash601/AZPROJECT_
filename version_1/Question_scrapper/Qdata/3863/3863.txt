The World Chess Championship
2022 is about to start.
14 Classical games will be played between Chef and Carlsen in the championship, where each game has one of three outcomes — it can be won by Carlsen, won by Chef, or it can be a draw. The winner of a game gets
2 points, and the loser gets
0 points. If it’s a draw, both players get
1 point each.
The total prize pool of the championship is
100⋅X. At end of the
14 Classical games, if one player has strictly more points than the other, he is declared the champion and gets
60⋅X as his prize money, and the loser gets
40⋅X.
If the total points are tied, then the defending champion Carlsen is declared the winner. However, if this happens, the winner gets only
55⋅X, and the loser gets
45⋅X.
Given the results of all the
games, output the prize money that Carlsen receives.
The results are given as a string of length
14 consisting of the characters C, N, and D.
C denotes a victory by Carlsen.
N denotes a victory by Chef.
D denotes a draw.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Since Carlsen won all the games, he will be crowned the champion and will get
60⋅X as the prize money which is
60⋅100=6000
Test case
2: Carlsen won
7 games and drew
7, so his score is
2⋅7+1⋅7=21. Chef lost
7 games and drew
7, so his score is
0⋅7+1⋅7=7. Since Carlsen has more points, he will be crowned the champion and will get
60⋅X as the prize money which is
60⋅400=24000
Test case
3: Carlsen and Chef both end up with
14 points. So, Carlsen is declared the winner, but because the points were tied, he receives
55⋅X=55⋅30=1650 in prize money.
