Alice and Bob will play a game on an array
A, consisting of
N numbers. The rules of the games are:
Alice and Bob will construct a binary tree of exactly
N leaves.
Each node of the tree is given a value:
If the node is a leaf, its value will be one of the unused array's elements.
Else, the node's value will be the sum of its two children.
The ugliness of the tree is defined as the sum of all the nodes' values.
Bob wins the game if the ugliness of Bob's tree is strictly lower than that of Alice's tree. Otherwise, Alice wins the game.
Note that each array’s elements,
A
i
 (1≤i≤N), will correspond to one and only one leaf.
Alice, after a lot of mindboggling, found that the optimal structure of a binary tree will be such that each non-leaf node has at least one child which is a leaf.
Bob is too eager to win the game. Before the game starts he can do the following operations any number of times (possibly 0):
Select two integers
x,i (1≤X≤10
12
,1≤i≤N), change
A
i
to
x.
After performing all the operations, he draws all possible binary trees and chooses the best one.
Note that Alice and Bob will play on the modified array
A.
Find the minimum number of operations Bob must perform to win the game or state that Bob can't win the game.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of elements in the array
A.
The second line of input contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
— the elements of the array
A.
Output Format
For each testcase - print "YES", if it is possible for Bob to win the game, followed by
N integers in the next line denoting the elements of the modified array
A, after performing all the operations. Otherwise, print "No".
You can output the answer "YES" (and "NO") in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

Explanation:
In the first testcase, getting the ugliness less than that of Alice's tree is impossible. Alice's tree will have the node values: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
In the second testcase, Alice's tree will have the nodes' values: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bob can make the binary tree with nodes' values: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 4.
Bob can't win from Alice in zero operations.
