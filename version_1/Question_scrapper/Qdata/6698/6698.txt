You are given an array
A of size
N.
You may perform at most
M operations, where each operation allows you to increase an element of the array by
1.
An array is considered
K-beautiful if all subarrays of size
K have equal sum of elements.
Find the number of ways to make the array
K-beautiful using no more than
M operations. Since the answer can be large, output your answer modulo
998244353.
Note that, two ways of making the array
K-beautiful are considered different, if the final arrays in both the ways are different.
Input Format
The first line contains a single positive integer
T, indicating the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three positive integers
N,
M, and
K, denoting the size of the array, the maximum number of operation to be performed, and the subarray size respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

Output Format
For each test case, output one non-negative positive integer, denoting the number of ways to make the array
K-beautiful, modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can make the array
A=[1,2,1,2,1], as
3-beautiful using at most
4 operations. There are
5 ways to make the array
3-beautiful. The final arrays in these ways are:
[2,2,1,2,2],
[2,2,2,2,2],
[2,2,3,2,2],
[2,3,1,2,3], and
[3,2,1,3,2].
Test case
2: We can make the array
A=[7,3,4], as
2-beautiful using at most
3 operations. There is only
1 way to make the array
2-beautiful. The final array in that way would be
[7,3,7].
