Given an array arr[ ] of size N consisting of distinct integers, write a program that returns 1 if given array can represent preorder traversal of a possible BST, else returns 0.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr = {2, 4, 3}
Output: 1
Explaination: Given arr[] can represent
preorder traversal of following BST:
  2
  \
  4
  /
  3
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
Arr = {2, 4, 1}
Output: 0
Explaination: Given arr[] cannot represent
preorder traversal of a BST.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function canRepresentBST() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as input parameters and returns 1 if given array can represent preorder traversal of a BST, else returns 0.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
