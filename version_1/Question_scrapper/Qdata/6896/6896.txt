Consider
N families (numbered
0 through
N−1). Each year, each family gives gifts to all other families based on the gifts they received in the previous year. Let's say that in some year, family
i received gifts with value
a
i
(from all families in total). Then, for each valid
j, the value of the gifts given by family
i to family
j in the next year is
G(i,j)⋅a
i
, where
G(i,j)=2⋅(i∨j)−(i+j); note that
∨ denotes bitwise OR.
For each valid
i, you are given the total value of gifts received by family
i in the year
0. Find the total values of gifts received by each family in the year
K. Since these values can be very large, compute them modulo
10

+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

. For each valid
i,
a

denotes the total value of gifts received by family
i in the year
0.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N integers. For each
i (
0≤i<N), the
i+1-th of these integers should be the total value of gifts received by family
i in the year
K, modulo
