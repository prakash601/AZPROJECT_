Doctor Kunj installed new software on cyborg Shresth. This software introduced Shresth to range minimum queries.
Cyborg Shresth thought of
T different problems in each of which you will be given an array
A of length
N and an array
B of length
M. In each of these problems, you have to calculate:
∑
i=1
m
∑
j=i
m
rangeMin(B[i],B[j])
Where
rangeMin(i,j) returns the minimum element in the range of indices
i to
j (both included) in array
A.
It is given that array
B consists of pairwise distinct elements and is in ascending order.
First line will contain
T, the number of different problems Cyborg Shresth thought of.
Each problem's input data will be given in three different lines.
The first line will contain
N and
M, the length of array
A and
B respectively.
The second line will contain
N space separated positive integers, which form the array
A. -
The third line will contain
M space separated positive integers, which form the array
B.
###Output Format:
For each different problem, print on a new line the answer to the problem, i.e. the value of
∑
i=1
m
∑
j=i
m
rangeMin(B[i],B[j]) .
Constraints:
1≤T≤10
5
1≤N≤10
5
1≤M≤10
5
1≤A[i]≤10
9
1≤B[i]≤N
It is guaranteed that the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Sample Input:
1
7 3
10 3 7 9 1 19 2
1 4 6
Sample Output:
43
###Explanation:
For the given array
A, we have to calculate
rangeMin(1,1)+rangeMin(1,4)+rangeMin(1,6)+rangeMin(4,4)+rangeMin(4,6)+rangeMin(6,6).
This is equal to
10+3+1+9+1+19=43.
