Your teacher gave you an assignment — given an integer
N, construct a binary string
B=b
1

…b
N
of length
N such that:
max(b
i
,b
i+1
)=1
for every
i from
1 to
N−1.
What is the minimum number of
1's such a binary string can contain?
Note: A binary string is a string consisting of only the digits
0 and
1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer
— the length of binary string you'd like to construct.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of
1's required to complete the assignment.

Explanation:
Test case
1: One possible binary string is
010101. This has three
1's, and it can be verified that the maximum of any two adjacent characters is
1.
Achieving this with less than three
1's is not possible.
Test case
2: One possible binary string is
10101010. This has four
1's, and it can be verified that the maximum of any two adjacent characters is
1.
Achieving this with less than four
1's is not possible.
Test case
3: One possible binary string is
10. This has one
1, and it can be verified that the maximum of any two adjacent characters is
1.
Test case
4: One possible binary string is
010. This has one
1, and it can be verified that the maximum of any two adjacent characters is
1.
