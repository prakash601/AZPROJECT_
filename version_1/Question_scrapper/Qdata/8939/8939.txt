You are given an array of integers
a1,a2,…,an
and an integer
x
.
You need to select the maximum number of elements in the array, such that for every subsegment
al,al+1,…,ar
containing strictly more than one element
(l<r)
, either:
At least one element on this subsegment is not selected, or
al+al+1+…+ar≥x⋅(r−l+1)
.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
): the number of test cases.
The descriptions of
t
test cases follow, three lines per test case.
In the first line you are given one integer
n
(
1≤n≤50000
): the number of integers in the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−100000≤ai≤100000
).
The third line contains one integer
x
(
−100000≤x≤100000
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of elements that you can select.

Note
In the first example, one valid way to select the elements is
[
1
_
,2,
3
_
,
4
_
,
5
_
]
. All subsegments satisfy at least one of the criteria. For example, for the subsegment
l=1
,
r=2
we have that the element
2
is not selected, satisfying the first criterion. For the subsegment
l=3
,
r=5
we have
3+4+5=12≥2⋅3
, satisfying the second criterion.
We can't select all elements, because in this case for
l=1
,
r=2
all elements are selected and we have
a1+a2=3<2⋅2
. Thus, the maximum number of selected elements is
4
.
In the second example, one valid solution is

In the third example, one valid solution is

In the fourth example, one valid solution is
