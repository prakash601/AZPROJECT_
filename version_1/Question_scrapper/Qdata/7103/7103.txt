There is a communication channel with
N+1 stations (numbered
0 through
N). Station
0 wants to send a message to station
N. You may install memory disks at up to
K of the stations
1,2,…,N−1. Let's denote the increasing sequence of stations at which memory disks are installed by
(v
1
,v
2
,…,v
k
), where
k≤K is the number of such stations, and let
v
0
=0 and
v
k+1
=N. In stations other than
v
0
,v
1
,…,v
k+1
, it is only possible to send the message forward without storing it for later.
For each
i (
0≤i<N), if the message is currently at the station
i, this station can send the message to the station
i+1. This transfer takes one second regardless of its success or failure. With probability
p
i
, the transfer succeeds and the message reaches the station
i+1. Otherwise, the transfer fails and the message instantly goes back to the station
v
j
, where
j is the unique index such that
v
j
≤i<v
j+1
(if
i=v
j
, the message simply stays in the station
v
j
), and this station has to send it forward again.
Your task is to choose stations where memory disks should be installed, in such a way that the expected value of time needed for the message to reach station
N is the smallest possible. Find this smallest expected time.
You are not given the probabilities directly. Instead, you are given a non-increasing integer sequence
F

. For each valid
i,

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N+1 space-separated integers
F

,…,F

.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the smallest possible expected time needed for the message to reach station
N. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6

Explanation
Example case 1: The probabilities of success are
p
0
=p
1
=1/2. If no memory disks are installed, the expected amount of time the message needs to reach station
2 is
6 seconds.
If a memory disk is installed at station
1, the expected time is
4 seconds (
2 seconds to transfer from station
0 to station
1 and further
2 seconds to transfer from station
1 to station
2).
