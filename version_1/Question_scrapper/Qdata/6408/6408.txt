You are given two strings
P and
Q. Consider some uniformly randomly and independently chosen non-empty prefix
X and non-empty suffix
Y of
P. A string
Z is formed by concatenating
X and
Y in this order. Find the probability that
Z is a substring of
Q.
It can be shown that the answer can be represented as a fraction
U/V, where
U and
V are non-negative integers and
V is coprime with
998,244,353. You should compute
U⋅V
−1
modulo
998,244,353, where
V
−1
denotes the multiplicative inverse of
V modulo
998,244,353.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string
P.
The second line contains a single string
Q.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
U⋅V
−1
modulo
998,244,353.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤∣P∣,∣Q∣≤100,000
P and
Q contain only lowercase English letters

Explanation:
Example case 1: There are
4 possible prefixes
X and
4 suffixes
Y. The only combinations that result in a string
Z that is a substring of
Q are:
X = "a",
Y = "ac"
X = "a",
Y = "c"
X = "ab",
Y = "c"
The probability that
Z is a substring of
Q is
3/16.
