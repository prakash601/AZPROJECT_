We know that a sequence of
N integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
A
K− beautiful permutation is a permutation for which
K is the minimum number of good consecutive segments into which the sequence can be partitioned.
A good consecutive segment is a non-empty continuous segment where all elements of the segment have the same parity.
For example, the permutation
[1,2,4,3] can be divided into minimum
3 segments
{[1],[2,4],[3]} where in each segment, all elements have same parity. Thus, this is a
3− beautiful permutation. Note that you can not divide
[1,2,4,3] into less than
3 consecutive segments which satisfy the given condition.
Chef had a permutation of size
N which was
K− beautiful but he forgot the elements at some of the positions of the permutation. Find the number of distinct permutations of length
N that are
K− beautiful and can be generated by filling the remaining positions of Chef's permutation.
Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo
(10

+7).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.

position.
Output Format
For each test case, print the number of distinct permutations of length
N that are
K− beautiful and can be generated by filling the remaining positions of Chef's permutation.

Explanation:
Test case
1 : Following are the distinct
2− beautiful permutations which satisfy
[1,0,0,0,4] :
[1,3,5,2,4] : Divided into
{[1,3,5],[2,4]}
[1,5,3,2,4] : Divided into
{[1,5,3],[2,4]}
Test case
2 : The permutations which are
3− beautiful and satisfy given permutation are
[2,1,3,5,4],
[2,1,5,3,4],
[2,3,1,5,4],
[2,5,1,3,4],
[2,3,5,1,4], and
[2,5,3,1,4]. So, our answer is
6.
