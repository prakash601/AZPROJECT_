Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob received a gift from his friend recently — a recursive sequence! He loves this sequence very much and wants to play with it.
Let
f1,f2,…,fi,…
be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Bob knows that for
i>k
,
fi
can be obtained by the following recursive equation:
fi=(f
b1
i−1
⋅f
b2
i−2
⋅⋯⋅f
bk
i−k
)modp,
which in short is
fi=(
k
∏
j=1
f
bj
i−j
)modp,
where
p=998244353
(a widely-used prime),
b1,b2,…,bk
are known integer constants, and
xmody
denotes the remainder of
x
divided by
y
.
Bob lost the values of
f1,f2,…,fk
, which is extremely troublesome – these are the basis of the sequence! Luckily, Bob remembers the first
k−1
elements of the sequence:
f1=f2=…=fk−1=1
and the
n
-th element:
fn=m
. Please find any possible value of
fk
. If no solution exists, just tell Bob that it is impossible to recover his favorite sequence, regardless of Bob's sadness.
Input
The first line contains a positive integer
k
(
1≤k≤100
), denoting the length of the sequence
b1,b2,…,bk
.
The second line contains
k
positive integers
b1,b2,…,bk
(
1≤bi<p
).
The third line contains two positive integers
n
and
m
(
k<n≤109
,
1≤m<p
), which implies
fn=m
.
Output
Output a possible value of
fk
, where
fk
is a positive integer satisfying
1≤fk<p
. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no such
fk
makes
fn=m
, output
−1
instead.
It is easy to show that if there are some possible values of
fk
, there must be at least one satisfying
1≤fk<p
.

Note
In the first sample, we have

. Therefore, applying
f3=4
, we have
f4=16
. Note that there can be multiple answers.
In the third sample, applying
f7=1
makes
f23333=1
.
In the fourth sample, no such
f1
makes
f88888=66666
. Therefore, we output
−1
instead.
