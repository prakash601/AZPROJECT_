You are given a multiset
S
. Over all pairs of subsets
A
and
B
, such that:
B⊂A
;
|B|=|A|−1
;
greatest common divisor of all elements in
A
is equal to one;
find the sum of
∑x∈Ax⋅∑x∈Bx
, modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
m
(
1≤m≤105
): the number of different values in the multiset
S
.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
ai
,
freqi
(
1≤ai≤105,1≤freqi≤109
). Element
ai
appears in the multiset
S
freqi
times. All
ai
are different.
Output
Print the required sum, modulo
998244353
.

Note
A multiset is a set where elements are allowed to coincide.
|X|
is the cardinality of a set
X
, the number of elements in it.
A⊂B
: Set
A
is a subset of a set
B
.
In the first example
B={1},A={1,2}
and
B={2},A={1,2}
have a product equal to
1⋅3+2⋅3=9
. Other pairs of
A
and
B
don't satisfy the given constraints.
