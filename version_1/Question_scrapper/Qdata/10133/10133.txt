Koa the Koala has a directed graph
G
with
n
nodes and
m
edges. Each edge has a capacity associated with it. Exactly
k
edges of the graph, numbered from
1
to
k
, are special, such edges initially have a capacity equal to
0
.
Koa asks you
q
queries. In each query she gives you
k
integers
w1,w2,…,wk
. This means that capacity of the
i
-th special edge becomes
wi
(and other capacities remain the same).
Koa wonders: what is the maximum flow that goes from node
1
to node
n
after each such query?
Help her!
Input
The first line of the input contains four integers
n
,
m
,
k
,
q
(
2≤n≤104
,
1≤m≤104
,
1≤k≤min(10,m)
,
1≤q≤2⋅105
) — the number of nodes, the number of edges, the number of special edges and the number of queries.
Each of the next
m
lines contains three integers
u
,
v
,
w
(
1≤u,v≤n
;
0≤w≤25
) — the description of a directed edge from node
u
to node
v
with capacity
w
.
Edges are numbered starting from
1
in the same order they are listed in the input. The first
k
edges are the special edges. It is guaranteed that
wi=0
for all
i
with
1≤i≤k
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains
k
integers
w1,w2,…,wk
(
0≤wi≤25
)  — the description of the query.
wi
denotes the capacity of
i
-th edge.
Output
For the
i
-th query, print one integer
resi
 — the maximum flow that can be obtained from node
1
to node
n
given the
i
-th query's special edge weights.

Note
For the second sample, the following images correspond to the first two queries (from left to right respectively). For each edge there is a pair flow/capacity denoting flow pushed through the edge and edge's capacity. The special edges are colored in red.
As you can see in first query maximum flow from node
1
to node
4
equals
0
and in second query equals
1
.
