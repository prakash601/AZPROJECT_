Joey is low on money. His friend Chandler wants to lend Joey some money, but can't give him directly, as Joey is too proud of himself to accept it. So, in order to trick him, Chandler asks Joey to play a game.
In this game, Chandler gives Joey an array
a1,a2,…,an
(
n≥2
) of positive integers (
ai≥1
).
Joey can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:
Take two indices
i
and
j
(
1≤i<j≤n)
.
Choose two integers
x
and
y
(
x,y≥1
) such that
x⋅y=ai⋅aj
.
Replace
ai
by
x
and
aj
by
y
.
In the end, Joey will get the money equal to the sum of elements of the final array.
Find the maximum amount of money
ans
Joey can get but print
2022⋅ans
. Why multiplied by
2022
? Because we are never gonna see it again!
It is guaranteed that the product of all the elements of the array
a
doesn't exceed
1012
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤4000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤50
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤106
) — the array itself.
It's guaranteed that the product of all
ai
doesn't exceed
1012
(i. e.
a1⋅a2⋅…⋅an≤1012
).
Output
For each test case, print the maximum money Joey can get multiplied by
2022
.

Note
In the first test case, Joey can do the following:
He chooses
i=1
and
j=2
(so he has
a[i]⋅a[j]=6
), chooses
x=6
and
y=1
and makes
a[i]=6
and
a[j]=1
.
[2,3,2]
i=1,j=2
→
x=6,y=1
[6,1,2]
He chooses
i=1
and
j=3
(so he has
a[i]⋅a[j]=12
), chooses
x=12
and
y=1
and makes
a[i]=12
and
a[j]=1
.
[6,1,2]
i=1,j=3
→
x=12,y=1
[12,1,1]
The sum is
14
which is the maximum of all possible sums. The answer is
2022⋅14=28308
.
