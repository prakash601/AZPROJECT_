You are given a tree with
N nodes, where the
i
th
node has a value
A
i
associated to it.
You need to answer
Q queries. Each query is of the form:
X
Y : Given two nodes
X and
Y
(1≤X,Y≤N), find the length of the longest arithmetic progression formed using the values of nodes on the shortest path between
X and
Y.
More formally, let there be
M nodes on the shortest path between nodes
X and
Y, and
G denote the shortest path from node
X to node
Y, where
G
1
=X,
G
M
=Y, and there exists an edge between nodes
G
i
and
G
i+1
for all
(1≤i<M).
Let
B denote the array
[A
G
1
,A
G
2
,…,A
G
M
]. Find the length of the longest subarray of
B which is an arithmetic progression.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, the values assigned to each node.
Next
N−1 lines contains
2 space-separated integers
u and
v denoting edge between nodes
u and
v.
Next line contains
Q, the number of queries.
Next
Q lines contain
2 space-separated integers
X and
Y.
Output Format
For each query, print the length of the longest arithmetic progression formed using the values of nodes on the shortest path between
X and
Y.

Explanation:
The tree looks like:
Query
1: The shortest path between nodes
9 and
10 is
[9,5,4,1,2,3,7,10]. The corresponding array
B=[A
9
,A
5
,A
4
,A
1
,A
2
,A
3
,A
7
,A
10
]=[6,5,3,1,3,6,5,4].
The longest subarray of
B which is also an arithmetic progression are
[5,3,1] and
[6,5,4]. Thus, the length of the longest subarray is
3.
Query
2: The shortest path between nodes
6 and
5 is
[6,3,2,1,4,5]. The corresponding array
B=[A
6
,A
3
,A
2
,A
1
,A
4
,A
5
]=[4,6,3,1,3,5].
The longest subarray of
B which is also an arithmetic progression is
[1,3,5]. Thus, the length of the longest subarray is
3.
