Before implementing any algorithm, we should be thorough with taking inputs. Here, we will learn how to read inputs.
You are given two inputs: a(integer), and b(string). You need to take the input and print a and b separated by a space.
Note : You don't have to print any new lines.
Example 1:
Input:
a = 5
b = Hello
Output:
5 Hello
Example 2:
Input:
a = 7
b = Geeks
Output:
7 Geeks
  Constraints:
1 <= a <= 106
