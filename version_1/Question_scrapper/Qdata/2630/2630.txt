Given an integer, check whether it is a palindrome or not.

Example 1:
Input: n = 555
Output: Yes

Example 2:
Input: n = 123
Output: No
  Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function is_palindrome() which takes the number as input parameter and returns "Yes" if it is palindrome otherwise returns "No"(Without quotes).
  Expected Time Complexity: O(x)
Expected Space Complexity: O(x) where x is number of digits in n.
  Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
