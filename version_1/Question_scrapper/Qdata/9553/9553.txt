You are given two strings
x
and
y
, both consist only of lowercase Latin letters. Let
|s|
be the length of string
s
.
Let's call a sequence
a
a merging sequence if it consists of exactly
|x|
zeros and exactly
|y|
ones in some order.
A merge
z
is produced from a sequence
a
by the following rules:
if
ai=0
, then remove a letter from the beginning of
x
and append it to the end of
z
;
if
ai=1
, then remove a letter from the beginning of
y
and append it to the end of
z
.
Two merging sequences
a
and
b
are different if there is some position
i
such that
ai≠bi
.
Let's call a string
z
chaotic if for all
i
from
2
to
|z|
zi−1≠zi
.
Let
s[l,r]
for some
1≤l≤r≤|s|
be a substring of consecutive letters of
s
, starting from position
l
and ending at position
r
inclusive.
Let
f(l1,r1,l2,r2)
be the number of different merging sequences of
x[l1,r1]
and
y[l2,r2]
that produce chaotic merges. Note that only non-empty substrings of
x
and
y
are considered.
Calculate
∑
1≤l1≤r1≤|x|1≤l2≤r2≤|y|
f(l1,r1,l2,r2)
. Output the answer modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a string
x
(
1≤|x|≤1000
).
The second line contains a string
y
(
1≤|y|≤1000
).
Both strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters.
Output
Print a single integer — the sum of
f(l1,r1,l2,r2)
over
1≤l1≤r1≤|x|
and
1≤l2≤r2≤|y|
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example there are:
6
pairs of substrings "a" and "b", each with valid merging sequences "01" and "10";
3
pairs of substrings "a" and "bb", each with a valid merging sequence "101";
4
pairs of substrings "aa" and "b", each with a valid merging sequence "010";
2
pairs of substrings "aa" and "bb", each with valid merging sequences "0101" and "1010";
2
pairs of substrings "aaa" and "b", each with no valid merging sequences;
1
pair of substrings "aaa" and "bb" with a valid merging sequence "01010";
Thus, the answer is
6⋅2+3⋅1+4⋅1+2⋅2+2⋅0+1⋅1=24
.
