Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sort() which takes the string as inputs and returns the modified string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S| * log |S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
S contains only lowercase alphabets.
