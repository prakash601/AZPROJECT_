Given a 2D binary matrix A of dimensions NxM, determine the row that contains a minimum number of 1's.
Note-The matrix contains only 1s and 0s. Also, if two or more rows contain the minimum number of 1's, the answer is the lowest of those indices.
Example 1:
Input:
N=4,M=4
A=[[1,1,1,1],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1],[1,1,1,1]]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Rows 2 and 3 contain the minimum number 
of 1's(2 each).Since, 2 is less than 3.
Thus, the answer is 2.
Example 2:
Input:
N=3,M=3
A=[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output:
1
Explanation:
All the rows contain the same number 
of 1's(0 each).Among them, index 1 
is the smallest, so the answer is 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minRow() which takes the two integers N, M as well as the 2D matrix A as input parameters and returns the minimum index of the row which contains the least number of 1's.

Expected Time Complexity:O(N*M)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N,M <= 1000
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1
