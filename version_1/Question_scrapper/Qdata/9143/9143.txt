Mr. Chanek wants to knit a batik, a traditional cloth from Indonesia. The cloth forms a grid
a
with size
n×m
. There are
k
colors, and each cell in the grid can be one of the
k
colors.
Define a sub-rectangle as an ordered pair of two cells
((x1,y1),(x2,y2))
, denoting the top-left cell and bottom-right cell (inclusively) of a sub-rectangle in
a
. Two sub-rectangles
((x1,y1),(x2,y2))
and
((x3,y3),(x4,y4))
have the same pattern if and only if the following holds:
they have the same width (
x2−x1=x4−x3
);
they have the same height (
y2−y1=y4−y3
);
for every pair
(i,j)
where
0≤i≤x2−x1
and
0≤j≤y2−y1
, the color of cells
(x1+i,y1+j)
and
(x3+i,y3+j)
are equal.
Count the number of possible batik color combinations, such that the subrectangles
((ax,ay),(ax+r−1,ay+c−1))
and
((bx,by),(bx+r−1,by+c−1))
have the same pattern.
Output the answer modulo
109+7
.
Input
The first line contains five integers
n
,
m
,
k
,
r
, and
c
(
1≤n,m≤109
,
1≤k≤109
,
1≤r≤min(106,n)
,
1≤c≤min(106,m)
) — the size of the batik, the number of colors, and size of the sub-rectangle.
The second line contains four integers
ax
,
ay
,
bx
, and
by
(
1≤ax,bx≤n
,
1≤ay,by≤m
) — the top-left corners of the first and second sub-rectangle. Both of the sub-rectangles given are inside the grid (
1≤ax+r−1
,
bx+r−1≤n
,
1≤ay+c−1
,
by+c−1≤m
).
Output
Output an integer denoting the number of possible batik color combinations modulo
109+7
.
