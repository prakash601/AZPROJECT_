Chef has an array
A of length
N and an integer
X.
In one operation, Chef does the following:
Find the smallest element in the current array. Let this be
S.
Next, pick any one index
i such that
A
i
=S
Finally, replace
A
i
with
A
i
⊕X
Here
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
For example, if
A=[1,1,2] and
X=4, then in one move Chef can turn the array into either
[5,1,2] or
[1,5,2].
Chef performs this operation exactly
Y times. Let
B be final array obtained.
Output the array
B in sorted order. Note that under this restriction, the output is unique.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
X, and
Y.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output array
B in sorted order.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The array is initially
[9]. Since there is only one element, it will be modified in each step. So,
After the first operation, the array is
[15] (since
9⊕6=15)
After the second operation, the array is
[9] (since
15⊕6=9)
Continuing the above, it can be verified that after
99 steps, the array is
[15].
Test case
3: The sequence of steps is as follows:
Initially, the array is
[5,10,15,20,25]
After operation
1, it is
[17,10,15,20,25]
After operation
2, it is
[17,30,15,20,25]
After operation
3, it is
[17,30,27,20,25]
After operation
4, it is
[5,30,27,20,25]
After operation
5, it is
[17,30,27,20,25]
After operation
6, it is
[5,30,27,20,25]
Remember to print the output in sorted order.
