Chef has an integer
N and he wants to generate a matrix
M with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
N columns (numbered
1 through
N). He thinks that
M would be delicious if:
Each element of this matrix is an integer between
1 and
N
2
inclusive.
All the elements of the matrix are pairwise distinct.
For each square submatrix containing cells in rows
r through
r+a and in columns
c through
c+a (inclusive) for some valid integers
r,
c and
a≥0:
M
r,c
+M
r+a,c+a
is even
M
r,c+a
+M
r+a,c
is even
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print
N lines describing a delicious matrix
M. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain
N space-separated integers
M
i,1
,M
i,2
,…,M
i,N
.
Constraints

Explanation:
Example case 1: The matrix
M has five square submatrices. Four of them (
[1],
[2],
[4],
[3]) have
a=0, so they obviously satisfy all conditions. The last square submatrix is the whole matrix
M, with
r=c=a=1, and we can see that
M
1,1
+M

=1+3=4 and
M
1,2
+M
2,1
=2+4=6 are both even.
