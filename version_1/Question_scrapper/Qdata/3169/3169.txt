Given a Binary Tree. Find the difference between the sum of node values at even levels and the sum of node values at the odd levels.
Example 1:
Input:
 1
 / \
 2 3

Output: -4

Explanation:
sum at odd levels - sum at even levels
= (1)-(2+3) = 1-5 = -4
Example 2:
Input:
 10
 / \
 20 30
 / \ 
 40 60 

Output: 60

Explanation:
sum at odd levels - sum at even levels
= (10+40+60) - (20+30)
= 110 - 50
= 60

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function getLevelDiff() which takes root node as input parameter and returns an integer.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(height of tree)
  Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
