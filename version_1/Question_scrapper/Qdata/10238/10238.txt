Ashish has
n
elements arranged in a line.
These elements are represented by two integers
ai
 — the value of the element and
bi
 — the type of the element (there are only two possible types:
0
and
1
). He wants to sort the elements in non-decreasing values of
ai
.
He can perform the following operation any number of times:
Select any two elements
i
and
j
such that
bi≠bj
and swap them. That is, he can only swap two elements of different types in one move.
Tell him if he can sort the elements in non-decreasing values of
ai
after performing any number of operations.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(1≤t≤100)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(1≤n≤500)
 — the size of the arrays.
The second line contains
n
integers
ai
(1≤ai≤105)
 — the value of the
i
-th element.
The third line containts
n
integers
bi
(bi∈{0,1})
 — the type of the
i
-th element.
Output
For each test case, print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes) depending on whether it is possible to sort elements in non-decreasing order of their value.
You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
For the first case: The elements are already in sorted order.
For the second case: Ashish may first swap elements at positions
1
and
2
, then swap elements at positions
2
and
3
.
For the third case: The elements are already in sorted order.
For the fourth case: No swap operations may be performed as there is no pair of elements
i
and
j
such that
bi≠bj
. The elements cannot be sorted.
For the fifth case: Ashish may swap elements at positions
3
and
4
, then elements at positions
1
and
2
.
