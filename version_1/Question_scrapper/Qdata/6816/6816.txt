Let's call an integer sequence nice if the sum of its elements is divisible by a given integer
K. You are given an integer sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Hasan wanted to find the number of nice subsequences of this sequence. However, this problem is too easy, so Hasan decided to add an extra constraint.
For an arbitrary non-empty sequence of indices
i
1
<i
2
<…<i
L
, let's call a subsequence
A

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
K and
W.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of very nice subsequences modulo
