Chef recently discovered a function
XOR(), which computes the XOR of all elements of a sequence:
XOR(a
1..n
)=a
1
⊕a
2
⊕⋯⊕a
n
.
Chef has a sequence
A with size
N. He generated a new sequence
B with size
N
2
using the following formula:
B
iN+j+1
=(A
i+1
+A
j+1
)∀0≤i,j<N.
Compute the value of
XOR(B).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the problem.
