Given an array of N positive integers. You need to write a program to print the minimum product of k integers of the given array.

Note: Since output could be large, hence module 10^9+7 and then print answer.
Example 1:
Input : Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, K = 2
Output : 2
Explanation:
If we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 
We will get the minimum product after multiplying
1 and 2 that is 2.
So, the answer is 2.
Example 2:
Arr[] = {9, 10, 8}, K = 3
Output : 720
  Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function minProduct() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), element K, and return the minimum product. The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ K, N ≤ 105
