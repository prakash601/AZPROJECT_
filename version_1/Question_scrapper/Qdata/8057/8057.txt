Hossam woke up bored, so he decided to create an interesting array with his friend Hazem.
Now, they have an array
𝑎
of
𝑛
positive integers, Hossam will choose a number
𝑎
𝑖
and Hazem will choose a number
𝑎
𝑗
.
Count the number of interesting pairs
(
𝑎
𝑖
,
𝑎
𝑗
)
that meet all the following conditions:
1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛
;
𝑖≠𝑗
;
The absolute difference
|
𝑎
𝑖
−
𝑎
𝑗
|
must be equal to the maximum absolute difference over all the pairs in the array. More formally,
|
𝑎
𝑖
−
𝑎
𝑗
|=
max
1≤𝑝,𝑞≤𝑛
|
𝑎
𝑝
−
𝑎
𝑞
|
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤100
), which denotes the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
𝑛
(
2≤𝑛≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
𝑛
integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
𝑛
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print an integer — the number of interesting pairs
(
𝑎
𝑖
,
𝑎
𝑗
)
.

Note
In the first example, the two ways are:
Hossam chooses the fourth number
8
and Hazem chooses the fifth number
1
.
Hossam chooses the fifth number
1
and Hazem chooses the fourth number
8
.
In the second example, the four ways are:
Hossam chooses the second number
2
and Hazem chooses the sixth number
10
.
Hossam chooses the sixth number
10
and Hazem chooses the second number
2
.
Hossam chooses the fifth number
2
and Hazem chooses the sixth number
10
.
Hossam chooses the sixth number
10
and Hazem chooses the fifth number
2
.
