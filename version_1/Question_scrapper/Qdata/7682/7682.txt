You are given
N distinct points
(P
1,x
,P
1,y
),(P
2,x
,P
2,y
),…,(P
N,x
,P
N,y
) on the coordinate plane, and
Q queries in the form L R X.
In each query, consider the polygon formed by the points in the interval
[L,R] (i.e. the points
(P
L,x
,P
L,y
),(P
L+1,x
,P
L+1,y
),…,(P
R,x
,P
R,y
)), along with
(0,0) and
(X,0).
If this polygon is not convex, that is the polygon contains an angle greater than
180
∘
, output
−1.
Otherwise, the polygon can be dissected into
R−L+1 triangles that all contain
(X,0) as a vertex. Out of these triangles, consider the triangle with the maximum area, and let this area be
A. Output
2A.
Input Format
The first line contains one integer
N - the number of points.
The
i-th line of the next
N lines contain two integers
P
i,x
and
P
i,y
- the
x and
y coordinate of the
i-th point.
The next line contains one integer
Q - the number of queries.
Each of the next
Q lines contain three integers
L,
R, and
X representing a query.
Output Format
For each query, output on a single line
−1 if the polygon is not convex, otherwise output
2A, where
A is the area of the largest triangle the polygon can be dissected into per the statement's description.

Explanation:
Query
1:
In the diagram above, note how the polygon can be dissected into
2 triangles that both include vertex
(X,0). The purple triangle has an area of
3 and the blue triangle has an area of
4.
Therefore,
2A=2×4=8.
