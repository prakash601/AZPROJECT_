Manao is solving a problem with the following statement:
He came up with a solution that produces the correct answers but is too slow. You are given the pseudocode of his solution, where the function getAnswer calculates the answer to the problem:

getAnswer(a[1..n], b[1..len], h)
  answer = 0
  for i = 1 to n-len+1
    answer = answer + f(a[i..i+len-1], b, h, 1)
  return answer

f(s[1..len], b[1..len], h, index)
  if index = len+1 then
    return 1
  for i = 1 to len
    if s[index] + b[i] >= h
      mem = b[i]
      b[i] = 0
      res = f(s, b, h, index + 1)
      b[i] = mem
      if res > 0
        return 1
  return 0
Your task is to help Manao optimize his algorithm.
Input
The first line contains space-separated integers n, len and h (1 ≤ len ≤ n ≤ 150000; 1 ≤ h ≤ 109). The second line contains len space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., blen (1 ≤ bi ≤ 109). The third line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).
Output
Print a single number — the answer to Manao's problem.
