Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering
N points.
To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length.
He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number
M.
Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as
M, to cover all the points.
###Input:
The first line contains two integers
N and
M, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
The next n lines contain two space separated integers
X and
Y, the coordinates of the point.
###Output: Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than
10
−6
.
###Constraints
2≤N≤1000000
−1000≤M≤1000
−1000000≤X≤1000000
−1000000≤Y≤1000000
###Sample Input: 4 1 0 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 0
###Sample Output: 5.656854249492380
Note:
As the input size is large, it is recommended to use Fast IO.
