Chef has an array
A of length
N.
In one operation, Chef can choose any subsequence of the array and any integer
X and then add
X to all the elements of the chosen subsequence.
Determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array distinct.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the length of Array

Explanation:
Test case
1:
Operation
1: Choose the subsequence
{A
1
} and add
X=1 to the elements. The array becomes
A=[4,3,3].
Operation
2: Choose the subsequence
{A
2
} and add
X=2 to the elements. The array becomes
A=[4,5,3].
Thus, we require, minimum
2 operations to make all the elements distinct.
Test case
2:
Operation
1: Choose the subsequence
{A
1
,A
6
} and add
X=4 to the elements. The array becomes
A=[5,3,2,1,2,6].
Operation
2: Choose the subsequence
{A
3
} and add
X=5 to the elements. The array becomes
A=[5,3,7,1,2,6].
Thus, we require, minimum
2 operations to make all the elements distinct.
Test case
3:
Operation
1: Choose the subsequence
{A
3
,A
4
} and add
X=2 to the elements. The array becomes
A=[1,2,3,4].
Thus, we require, minimum
1 operation to make all the elements distinct.
Test case
4: All the elements are distinct. We need zero operations.
