A sequence is almost-increasing if it does not contain three consecutive elements
x,y,z
such that
x≥y≥z
.
You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
and
q
queries.
Each query consists of two integers
1≤l≤r≤n
. For each query, find the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray
al,al+1,…,ar
.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers,
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤200000
)  — the length of the array
a
and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
)  — the values of the array
a
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains the description of a query. Each line contains two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
)  — the query is about the subarray
al,al+1,…,ar
.
Output
For each of the
q
queries, print a line containing the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray
al,al+1,…,ar
.

Note
In the first query, the subarray is
a1,a2,a3=[1,2,4]
. The whole subarray is almost-increasing, so the answer is
3
.
In the second query, the subarray is
a1,a2,a3,a4=[1,2,4,3]
. The whole subarray is a almost-increasing, because there are no three consecutive elements such that
x≥y≥z
. So the answer is
4
.
In the third query, the subarray is
a2,a3,a4,a5=[2,4,3,3]
. The whole subarray is not almost-increasing, because the last three elements satisfy
4≥3≥3
. An almost-increasing subsequence of length
3
can be found (for example taking
a2,a3,a5=[2,4,3]
). So the answer is
3
.
