Chef Ceil has some matchsticks in his kitchen.
Detail of matchsticks:
There are
N matchsticks in total. They are numbered from to
0 to
N−1 inclusive. The
i
th
matchstick takes
b
i
time to burn when lighted at one end, and it burns at a uniform rate.
If lighted at both ends simultaneously, the matchstick will take only half of the original time to burn down.
Arrangement:
He ties rear end of the all the matchsticks together at one point and the front end is kept free. The matchstick numbered
i is adjacent to matchstick numbered
i for all
iN.
Bodies of matchsticks do not touch each other, except at the rear end.
Task:
There are
Q queries, in each query we ask: If he lights the free end of all matchsticks numbered between
L and
R inclusive, what will be the time needed for all matchsticks to get completely burnt?
Input
First line of input contains a single integer
N.
The next line contains
N space separated integers, the
i
th
of which is
b
i
The next line contains a single integer
Q
The next
Q lines each contain two space separated integers -
L and
R. The
i
th
line represents the
i
th
query.
Output
For each query, print the answer on a new line.

Explanation:
Test Case 3: , in the figure above, yellow colored matches are lighted by a lighter simultaneously.
The numbers indicate the time required to burn that matchstick (if lighted at one end).
Now the first lighted matchstick will completely burn in
5 seconds. Then it will light up all the rest matches from the rear end.
Some matches will have fire at both ends and thus after
5 seconds, they will start burning with twice the original rate.
Thus time taken for matches to burn completely will be : (from left to right):
8.0,
9.0,
7.0,

9.0 (the maximum among these).
