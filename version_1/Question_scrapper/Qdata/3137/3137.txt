Given an array and a number k, find the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers. It may be assumed that the size of array is at-least k.
  Example 1:
Input : 
n = 4
arr[] = {-4, -2, 1, -3}
k = 2
Output : 
-1
Explanation :
The sub array is {-2, 1}
  Example 2:
Input :
n = 6
arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
k = 2
Output : 
6
Explanation :
The sub array is {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
  Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxSumWithK() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer K as inputs and returns the value of the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
  Constraints:
1<=n<=105
-105<=a[i]<=105
1<=k<=n
