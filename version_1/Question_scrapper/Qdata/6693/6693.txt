There is a grid containing
N rows and
N columns. The cell at the
i
th
row from the top and
j
th
column from the left is a passable space if
S
i,j
is '.' and a blocked cell if
S
i,j
is '#'.
Chef is at the top-left cell and wants to reach the bottom-right cell. Chef can move one cell down, or right to a passable cell. He can't leave the grid. If Chef is at the cell
(i,j), he can collect
A
i,j
coins.
Now, Chef has a special ability using which he can make all the blocked cells in a path of length
K into passable cells. Chef uses this ability before moving from the top-left cell. It is possible that some of the cells in the chosen
K length path are already passable. More formally, Chef can choose a sequence of
K cells such that for each
i
(1≤i<K), the
i
th
and
(i+1)
th
cells of the sequence are adjacent and make all these
K cells passable.
Find the maximum amount of coins Chef can collect in the path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. Print
−1 if it is impossible to reach the bottom-right cell.
Note: Two cells are considered to be adjacent if they share a common side. The cell
(i,j) has four adjacent cells i.e. the cells
(i−1,j),
(i+1,j),
(i,j−1) and
(i,j+1). It is guaranteed that the top-left cell of the grid is a passable cell.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N,K.
N lines follow. The
i
th
of these lines contains a string
S
i
of length
N. The
j
th
character of
S
i
is '.' if the cell
(i,j) is passable, or '#' if it is a blocked cell.
Next
N lines follow. The
i
th
of these lines contains
N space-separated integers
A
i,j
, denoting the number of coins in the cell
(i,j).
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum amount of coin Chef can collect in the path or
−1 if it is impossible to reach the bottom-right cell.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef breaks the blocked cell
(2,1) and choose the path -
(1,1)→(2,1)→(2,2). Total coins collected in the path is
1+3+4=8.
Test case
2: There is no way to choose a path of length
3 such that after breaking the blocked cells in the path, it is possible to reach the bottom-right cell.
Test case
3: Chef chooses the path of consisting of cells
(2,3),
(2,4),
(3,4),
(4,4) and break the blocked cells in this path. Then Chef chooses the path -
(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(2,4)→(3,4)→(4,4)→(5,4)
→(5,5). Total coins collected in the path is
2+3+4
+15+12+8
+9+4+5=62.
