There are
N dungeons in a row. The
i
th
dungeon is guarded by a monster with strength
S
i
.
Saber has a sword with
D damage points. To defeat a monster of strength
S
i
, Saber's sword must have at least
S
i
damage points:
If
D<S
i
, Saber loses the fight.
If
D=S
i
, Saber defeats the monster but has a close call and her sword loses exactly one damage point
(D:=D−1).
If
D>S
i
, Saber defeats the monster with no change in the damage points of her sword.
You are given
Q queries of the following type:
Given
L and
R, find the minimum damage points
D required by Saber to make it through dungeons
S

defeating all monsters in them in the same order.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains
T, the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
Q, the number of dungeons and the number of queries.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
S

N
, the strengths of the monsters in each of the dungeons.
The next
Q lines each contain two integers
L

and
R

, the descriptions of the queries.
Output Format
For each test case, print
Q lines, each with a single integer, the answer to the query.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
5 monsters and
3 queries.
Query
1:
L=2,R=4 corresponds to the subarray
[3,2,2]. If Alice starts with
D<3, she would not be able to defeat the first monster. If Alice starts with
D=3,
She defeats the first monster but has a close call, so now
D=2.
Then she defeats the second one too and again has a close call, so now
D=1.
She is unable to defeat the last monster.
It is easy to show that
D=4 is sufficient for Alice to defeat all of the above monsters.
