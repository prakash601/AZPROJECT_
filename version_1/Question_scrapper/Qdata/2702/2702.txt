Given a binary tree. Find the postorder traversal of the tree without using recursion.
Example 1
Input:
 1
 / \
 2 3
 / \
 4 5

Output: 4 5 2 3 1
Explanation:
Postorder traversal (Left->Right->Root) of 
the tree is 4 5 2 3 1.
Example 2
Input:
 8
 / \
 1 5
 \ / \
 7 10 6
 \ /
  10 6

Output: 10 7 1 6 10 6 5 8 
Explanation:
Postorder traversal (Left->Right->Root) 
of the tree is 10 7 1 6 10 6 5 8 .
  Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function postOrder() which takes the root of the tree as input and returns a list containing the postorder traversal of the tree, calculated without using recursion.
  Expected time complexity: O(N)
Expected auxiliary space: O(N)
  Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
1 <= Data of a node <= 105
