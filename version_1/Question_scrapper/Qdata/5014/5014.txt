As New Year is approaching, Salik is studying functions in order to sharpen his math skills. Instead of regular functions, he is studying a strange function F which operates on non-negative integers. The value of F(A) is obtained by the following process:
Compute the sum of digits of A; let's denote this sum by S.
If S is a single-digit integer, then F(A) = S.
Otherwise, F(A) = F(S).
It's guaranteed that this process correctly defines the function F.
Since this problem was pretty straightforward, he invented a new problem: Given two integers A and N, compute F(AN). Can you help him solve this task?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the value of F(AN).
Constraints

Explanation:
Example case 1: F(5 · 5) = F(25) = F(2+5) = F(7) = 7
Example case 2: F(7 · 7) = F(49) = F(4+9) = F(13) = F(1+3) = F(4) = 4
Example case 3: F(127) = F(1+2+7) = F(10) = F(1+0) = F(1) = 1
