Given an array of size
N and two integers
K and
S, the special sum of a subarray is defined as follows:
(Sum of all elements of the subarray) * (
K -
p *
S)
Where
p = number of distinct prime factors of “product of all elements of the subarray”.
Find the maximum special sum by considering all non-empty subarrays of the given array.
###Input
First line contains 3 integers
N,
K and
S.
Second line contains
N integers, the elements of the array.
###Output
Output a single integer. The maximum special sum considering all non-empty subarrays of the array.
###Constraints:
1≤N,K,S≤10
5
0≤K/S≤20
1< Any element of array
<10

###Sample Input
4 10 2
14 2 7 15
###Sample Output
138
###Sample Explanation
Consider the subarray {14, 2, 7}
Total number of distinct prime factors in it is 2 (2 and 7).
Therefore, value of special sum is (14 + 2 + 7) * (10 - 2 * 2) = 138.
This is the subarray with the maximum special sum.
