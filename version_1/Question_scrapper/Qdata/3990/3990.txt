Chef has a number
X whose value is initially
0. In one move, he can do one of the following:
Increment
X by
2 i.e.
X:=X+2
Decrement
X by
1 i.e.
X:=X−1
He can perform at most
Y moves. He wants to determine how many distinct values can
X have after performing at most
Y moves.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
Y — the maximum number of moves Chef can perform.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct values
X can have after performing at most
Y moves.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef can not perform any moves. Therefore final value of
X is
0.
Test Case 2: Chef can perform at most
1 move. Therefore the final value of
X can be
−1,
0,
2.
Test Case 3: Chef can perform at most
2 moves.
X=0 (no moves performed)
X=0
