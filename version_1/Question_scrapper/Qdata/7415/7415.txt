Chef's professor gave him homework to find a permutation of length
2
N
such that each integer from
0 to
2
N
−1 appears exactly once in the permutation and the maximum bitwise XOR of any even length subarray is minimized.
Chef wonders how many such permutations are there. Help Chef to find out the number of permutations modulo
(10
9
+7), satisfying the above conditions and also help him find one such permutation.
Input Format
First-line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer
N.
For each test case, print two lines of output.
In the first line, print the number of permutations modulo
(10
9
+7), for which maximum bitwise xor of any even-length subarray is minimized.
In the next line, print
2
N
space-separated numbers denoting any such permutation.
Constraints
1≤T≤18
1≤N≤18
Sum of
2
N
over all test cases does not exceed
10

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are two optimal permutations:
[0,1] and
[1,0].
Test case
2: The maximum xor value of any even-sized subarray will be
2 and there are
8 such permutations.
