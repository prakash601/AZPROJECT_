N one dimensional kingdoms are represented as intervals of the form [ai , bi] on the real line. A kingdom of the form [L, R] can be destroyed completely by placing a bomb at a point x on the real line if L ≤ x ≤ R.
Your task is to determine minimum number of bombs required to destroy all the one dimensional kingdoms.
Input
First line of the input contains T denoting number of test cases.
For each test case, first line contains N denoting the number of one dimensional kingdoms.
For each next N lines, each line contains two space separated integers ai and bi.
Output
For each test case , output an integer denoting the minimum number of bombs required.
Constraints
Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 , 0 ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤500
Subtask 2 (30 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 , 0 ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤ 1000
Subtask 3 (50 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 105, 0 ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤ 2000

Explanation:
There are three kingdoms [1,3] ,[2,5] and [6,9]. You will need at least 2 bombs to destroy the kingdoms. In one of the possible solutions, you can place two bombs at x = 2 and x = 6 .
