Edward Elric is chasing after Scar. To stop Edward, Scar creates
N barriers in the way, numbered from
1 to
N. Each barrier Scar created is either one of the following two types.
Type 1 barrier - This barrier starts from a height
X above the ground and extends till the sky.
Type 2 barrier - This barrier starts from the ground and extends up to height
X above the ground.
The height of Edward is
H units and he has an alchemic life force of
L units. Moreover, he can duck by
Y
1
units and jump by height
Y
2
units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier
1 till the barrier
N. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier. However, this costs him a single unit of his alchemic life force.
If after breaking a barrier no life force is left, Edward gets completely exhausted, unable to pass that barrier.
How many barriers can Edward cross?
And remember never to call him a pipsqueak if his height is too short!
Input:
The first line contains
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains five integers
N,
H,
Y
1
,
Y
2
and
L.
The i-th of the next
N lines contains two integers
t
i
and
X
i
for the
i
th
barrier where
t
i
=1 denotes a Type 1 Barrier and
t
i
=2 denotes a Type 2 barrier.
Output:
For each test case print a single line containing the number of barriers Edward can pass.

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
Given
N=6,
H=5,
Y
1
=1,
Y
2
=2 and
L=3.
He passes the first three barriers by either ducking or jumping. He uses alchemic life force for breaking
4
th
,
5
th
and
6
th
barriers because he cannot pass them by either jumping or ducking. He gets exhausted after breaking the
6
th
barrier and is unable to pass it. So, in total he passes
5 barriers.
