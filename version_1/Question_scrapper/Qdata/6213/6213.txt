Ridbit is given an array
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
. He needs to find the number of ways to divide the array into contiguous subarrays such that:
Each element of the sequence
a belongs to exactly one of the subarrays.
There is an integer
m such that the MEX of every subarray is equal to
m. The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in this sequence.
Help Ridbit with this task.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to divide the sequence, modulo
10
9
+7.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤100,000
0≤a

Explanation:
Example case 1: The five valid ways to divide the sequence are:
[1,0,0,1,0,1]
[1,0],[0,1,0,1]
[1,0,0],[1,0,1]
[1,0,0,1],[0,1]
[1,0],[0,1],[0,1]
