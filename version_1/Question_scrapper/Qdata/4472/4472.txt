Vasya has ordered a pizza delivery. The pizza can be considered a perfect circle. There were
n premade cuts in the pizza when it was delivered. Each cut is a straight segment connecting the center of the pizza with its boundary.
Let
O be the center of the pizza,
P
i
be the endpoint of the
i-th cut lying on the boundary, and
R be the point of the boundary straight to the right of
O. Then the counterclockwise-measured angle
∠ROP
i
is equal to
a
i
degrees, where
a
i
is an integer between
0 and
359. Note that angles between
0 and
180 angles correspond to
P
i
in the top half of the pizza, while angles between
180 and
360 angles correspond to the bottom half.
Vasya may cut his pizza a few more times, and the new cuts still have to be straight segments starting at the center. He wants to make the pizza separated into several equal slices, with each slice being a circular sector with no cuts inside of it. How many new cuts Vasya will have to make?
###Input:
The first line of input contains
T , i.e number of test cases per file.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n− the numbers of premade cuts (
2≤n≤360).
The second lines contains
n integers

###Output: Print a single integer
− the smallest number of additional cuts Vasya has to make so that the pizza is divided into several equal slices.

Explanation:
In the first sample the pizza is already cut into four equal slices.
In the second sample the pizza will be cut into three equal slices after making one extra cut at
330 degrees.
In the third sample Vasya will have to cut his pizza into
360 pieces of
1 degree angle each.
