Given a sequence of
N elements, Chef defines a function
F(i)
(1≤i≤N) as the median of the first
i elements of the sequence.
Chef wants to get a permutation
P of length
N such that
P
i
=F(i)
∀
1≤i≤N. Can you help Chef in achieving this?
Note that:
The median of a sequence is the middle element in the sorted order of the sequence. If
N is even, choose the element at
2
N
position in the sorted order. If
N is odd, choose the middle element.
A permutation of length
N is an array of
N integers
P=[P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
] such that every integer from
1 to
N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. For example,
[2,5,4,1,3] is a permutation of length
5 while
[2,5,2,1,3] is not.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, an integer
N, the length of the required permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a new line,
N space-separated integers, denoting a permutation satisfying the condition.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test Case
1:
[1] is the only permutation and it satisfies the condition as the median of the sequence
[1] is
1.
Test Case
2: The possible permutations of length
2 are
[1,2] and
[2,1]. The only permutation that satisfies the condition is
[2,1]. Here,
P
1
=2=median([2]) and
P
2
=1=median([2,1]).
Test Case
3: There are
6 possible permutations out of which only
[3,1,2] satisfies the above condition. Here,
P
1
=3=median([3]),P
2
=1=median([3,1]), and
P
3
=2=median([3,1,2]).
