Given integers
N and
X, generate a palindrome of length
N consisting of lowercase English alphabets such that the number of distinct characters in the palindrome is exactly
X.
If it is impossible to do so, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers
N,X, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, a palindrome of length
N consisting of such that the number of distinct characters in the palindrome is
X. If it is not possible to do so, print
−1 instead.
Constraints

1≤N≤10
5
1≤X≤min(N,26)
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: A possible palindrome of length
1 having
1 distinct character is z.
Test case
2: A possible palindrome of length
2 having
1 distinct character is aa.
Test case
3: It can be proven that there exists no possible palindrome of length
3 having
3 distinct characters.
Test case
4: The palindrome xyyx has length
4 and contains
2 distinct characters namely x and y.
