There are some hidden non-negative numbers
A and
B, with
0≤A<B<2
29
. You were not able to determine them and were gonna cry. Luckily, XOR The Detective decided to save your day!
XOR The Detective is a great interrogator. In one query, he can ask any integer
X such that
0≤X<2
30
, and learn the value of
(A+X)⊕(B+X). Here
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Help XOR The Detective to determine both
A and
B in at most
30 queries.
Interaction
Begin the interaction by reading a single integer
T
− the number of test cases.
For each test case, first read a single integer
Q
− the maximum allowed number of queries to ask.
To ask a question about number
X, output ?
X. Then, read the value of
(A+X)⊕(B+X).
To give your answer, output !
A
B. Right after this, if it wasn't your last test case, proceed to the next test case.
It's guaranteed that
A and
B are fixed before the start of the interaction.
Example Input
You             Interactor
                1
                30
? 0
                1
? 1             
                7 
! 2 3               
Explanation
The hidden numbers are
A=2 and
B=3.
In the first query, we get
(2+0)⊕(3+0)=1.
In the second query, we get
(2+1)⊕(3+1)=7.
Even though we can't uniquely determine
A,B from this information, we might still answer. Here, we got lucky.
