  Charles: "This is what life looks like. People who love each other. Home!! You should take a moment. Feel it ! You still have time"
Charles is brutally killed by X-24, and it is time for Logan to save and help Laura as soon as possible because even his healing factor is decreasing drastically.
Dr. Zander Rice reveals that the destruction of mutantkind is due to a genetic dampener created by his corporation, and after getting to know this Logan is extremely agitated.
Logan needs to increase his healing factor anyhow, and he will get the required serum only when he solves the given question.
Logan is provided an empty array A followed by Q queries. Each query will be of the following type :
1 Z : Insert an element Z at the end of array A.
2 X : Delete an element present at the Xth location in A.
3 X Z : Replace element present at the Xth location by Z.
4 L R K : Print Kth minimum number present in A in the range from L to R (inclusive).
Since Logan doesn't have much time, you need to help him.
  Input
First line of the input contains an integer Q denoting number of queries.
Next Q line contains queries in one of four forms described above.
  Output
For each type of 4th query print answer in new line.
  Constraints
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ Z ≤ 109
1 ≤ K ≤ R-L+1
L, R, X will be valid 1-based array indexes.
