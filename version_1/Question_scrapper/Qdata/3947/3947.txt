75% of the working days in the semester. If not, the student is failed.
Chef has been taking a lot of holidays, and is now concerned whether he can pass the attendance requirement or not.
N working days have already passed, and you are given
N bits -
B
1
,
B
2
, ...,
B
N
.
B
i
=
0 denotes that Chef was absent on the
i
th
day, and
B
i
=
1 denotes that Chef was present on that day.
Can Chef hope to pass the requirement by the end of the semester?
###Input:
First line will contain
T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer,
N, the number of days till now.
The second line of each testcase contains a string
B of length
N where
B
i
represents the status of the
i
th
day.
###Output: For each testcase, output the answer in a single line - "YES" if Chef can pass the attendance requirement and "NO" if not.

Explanation:
For Case 1, even if Chef attends all the remaining 70 days, he'll only have an attendance percentage of
70/120 =
58.33% which is less than
75%.
For Case 2, maximum attendance possible is
79.167% which is more than
75%.
For Case 3, maximum attendance possible is
99.167% which is more than
75%.
