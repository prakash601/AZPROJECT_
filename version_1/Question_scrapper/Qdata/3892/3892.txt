N candidates (numbered from
1 to
N) join Chef's firm. The first
5 candidates join on the first day, and then, on every subsequent day, the next
5 candidates join in.
For example, if there are
12 candidates, candidates numbered
1 to
5 will join on day
1, candidates numbered
6 to
10 on day
2 and the remaining
2 candidates will join on day
3.
Candidate numbered
K decided to turn down his offer and thus, Chef adjusts the position by shifting up all the higher numbered candidates. This leads to a change in the joining day of some of the candidates.
Help Chef determine the number of candidates who will join on a different day than expected.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two space-separated integers
N and
K denoting the number of candidates and the candidate who turned down the offer.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of candidates whose joining day will be changed.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The original joining day of each candidate is given as
[1,1,1,1,1,2,2] but as candidate
3 turns down his offer, the new joining days are now
[1,1,NA,1,1,1,2]. Candidate numbered
6 is the only one to have his joining day changed.
Test case
2: The original joining day of each candidate is given as
[1,1,1,1,1,2] but as candidate
6 turns down his offer, the new joining days are now
[1,1,1,1,1,NA]. No candidate got his joining day changed.
Test case
3: The original joining day of each candidate is given as
[1,1] but as candidate
1 turns down his offer, the new joining days are now
[NA,1]. No candidate got his joining day changed.
Test case
4: The original joining day of each candidate is given as
[1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3] but as candidate
2 turns down his offer, the new joining days are now
[1,NA,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3]. Candidate numbered
6 and
11 are the only ones to have their joining days changed.
