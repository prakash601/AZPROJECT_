You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. In one move, you can jump from the position
i
to the position
i−ai
(if
1≤i−ai
) or to the position
i+ai
(if
i+ai≤n
).
For each position
i
from
1
to
n
you want to know the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position
j
such that
aj
has the opposite parity from
ai
(i.e. if
ai
is odd then
aj
has to be even and vice versa).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of elements in
a
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
), where
ai
is the
i
-th element of
a
.
Output
Print
n
integers
d1,d2,…,dn
, where
di
is the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position
j
such that
aj
has the opposite parity from
ai
(i.e. if
ai
is odd then
aj
has to be even and vice versa) or -1 if it is impossible to reach such a position.
