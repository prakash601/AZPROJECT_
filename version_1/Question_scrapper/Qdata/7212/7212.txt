Given an array
C of
M integers and a square matrix
A (with integer entries) of dimension
N×N, verify whether the following equation is true,

(mod998244353)
where
0
N
is the square null matrix (matrix in which all elements are zero) and
I
N
is the identity matrix, both having dimensions
N×N.
Note:
Two matrices
A,B each with integer entries are said to be congruent modulo
M iff all entries of
A−B are divisible by
M. This is denoted as
A≡B(modM).
Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
M denoting the length of
C.
The second line of each testcase contains
M space separated integers,
C
0
,C
1
,…C
M−1
representing the array
C.
The third line of each testcase contains a single integer
N denoting the size of the square matrix
A.
The
i-th line of the next
N lines contains
N space-separated integers
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,…,A
i,N
denoting the elements of the
i-th row of the matrix
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line YES if the equation

Explanation:
Both test cases have the same co-efficients. Since
998244351≡−2(mod998244353) and
998244348≡−5(mod998244353), for convenience of explanation, we shall take the co-efficients as
−2,−5,1. Note that this does not affect the answer.
Test case
1: The given matrix,
A=[
1
3
2
4
], satisfies the equation
−2I
2
−5A+A
2
=0
2
, so the answer is YES.
Test case
2: For the given matrix,
A=[
1
1
1
1
], the left hand side of the equation evaluates to,
−2I
2
−5A+A
2
=[
−5
−3
−3
−5
]. Clearly none of the entries are divisible by
998244353, so the answer is NO.
