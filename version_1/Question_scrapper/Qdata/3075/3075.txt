Given an integer N represented in the form of a string, remove consecutive repeated digits from it.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 1224
Output: 124
Explanation: Two consecutive occurrences of 
2 have been reduced to one.
â€‹Example 2:
Input: 
N = 1242
Output: 1242
Explanation: No digit is repeating 
consecutively in N.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the integer N as input and returns the modified integer by removing all the consecutive duplicate occurrences in N.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=N<=1018
