You are given a positive integer
X which is at most
10
8
.
Find three distinct non-negative integers
A,B,C that do not exceed
10
9
and satisfy the following equation:
(A∣B)&(B∣C)&(C∣A)=X
Here,
∣ denotes the bitwise OR operator and
& denotes the bitwise AND operator.
It can be shown that a solution always exists for inputs satisfying the given constraints. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
, the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer,
X.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line three different space-separated integers
A,B,C.
Your output will be considered correct only if
A,B,C are distinct non-negative integers not exceeding
10
9
that satisfy the equation given in the problem statement.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤X≤10

Explanation:
Test case
1:
(1∣2)&(2∣3)&(3∣1)=3&3&3=3 and hence
A=1,B=2,C=3 is one valid solution when
X=3. However there are several other solutions.
For example,
A=1,B=6,C=3 is also valid and will also be considered correct.
Test case
2:
(2∣3)&(3∣4)&(4∣2)=(3&7)&6=3&6=2.
Test case
3:
(6∣9)&(9∣13)&(13∣6)=(15&13)&15=13&15=13.
