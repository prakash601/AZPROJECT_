MoEngage has given you an array
A consisting of
N positive integers.
You should perform
Q queries of the following two types:
1
i
X : Set
A
i
to
X.
2
L
R : Find the minimum non-negative integer
K such that the sequence
[∣A
L
−K∣,∣A
L+1
−K∣,…,∣A
R−1
−K∣,∣A
R
−K∣] is sorted in non-decreasing order. Print
−1 if no such
K exists.
For each query of type
2, output the minimum non-negative integer
K satisfying the constraint, or
−1 if there isn't any.
Input Format
The first line contains two integers
N,Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Then, the
i
th
of the next
Q lines contains three integers describing the queries
1
i
X or
2
L
R.
Output Format
For each query of type
2, output the minimum integer
K satisfying the constraint, or
−1 if there isn't any in a new line.

Explanation:
In the first query, selecting
K=4 makes the sequence
[∣A
1
−K∣,∣A
2
−K∣,∣A
3
−K∣,∣A
4
−K∣,∣A
5
−K∣]=[1,1,2,2,4]. This sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order. Also, there exists no value of
K less than
4 satisfying this.
In the second query, change
A
2
=7. After the second query, the array
A becomes
[5,7,2,6,0].
In the third query, there exists no value of
K satisfying the constraints.
