This is an interactive task
Let's clear things up with some definitions:
Two binary strings
S and
T are anagrams of each other if it is possible to rearrange the letters in the string
S to get a string equal to
T.
Let
S[l,r] be the substring of
S starting at
l and ending at
r both inclusive.
Let
f(S,l,r) be the frequency of character 1 in
S[l,r].
Chef has two hidden binary strings
A and
B both of which are of size
N. It is known that
A and
B are not anagrams.
You can make queries on the two strings. Each query is of the form:
? l r
The judge will reply with the value of
∣f(A,l,r)−f(B,l,r)∣
You have to find any such index
i such that both conditions are fulfilled:
A[1,i−1] and
B[1,i−1] are anagrams.
A[i+1,N] and
B[i+1,N] are anagrams.
If there is no such index then print -1.
You can make atmost
35 queries per test case.
Note:
i can be
1 or
N as well. We consider all of
A[1,0],B[1,0],A[N+1,N],B[N+1,N] to be empty strings.
Interaction
Begin the interaction by reading a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for
T test cases follows.
Then for each test case read a single integer
N denoting the size of
A and
B.
To ask a query, output ? i j (
1≤i≤j≤N) and then read a single integer.
To print the answer, output ! then print the index.
If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1000
A and
B are not anagrams of each other

Explanation
Test case
1:
A=0101,
B=1011
The query ? 1 3 gives
∣1−2∣=1
The query ? 2 4 gives
∣2−2∣=0
We can see that
A[1,2] and
B[1,2] are anagrams.
A[4,4] and
B[4,4] are anagrams.
Therefore
3 is a valid answer.
Test case
2:
A=111,
B=000
The query ? 1 1 gives
∣1−0∣=1
The query ? 2 3 gives
∣2−0∣=2
There is no index satisfying the conditions, so we print
−1.
Test case
3:
A=110,
B=001
The query ? 1 2 gives
∣2−0∣=2
The query ? 1 3 gives
∣2−1∣=1
We can see that
A[1,0] and
B[1,0] are anagrams (both are empty strings).
A[2,3] and
B[2,3] are anagrams.
Therefore
1 is a valid answer.
Note: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.
