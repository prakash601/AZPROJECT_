JJ loves playing with medians. He has an array
A of length
N (
N is odd). He wants to partition the array
A into two non-empty subsets
P and
Q such that the value of
∣median(P)−median(Q)∣ is as small as possible. (Note that each
A
i
must belong to either subset
P or subset
Q).
Help him find this minimum value of
∣median(P)−median(Q)∣.
As a reminder, the median of a subset
X of size
N is the element which occupies the
⌊
2
N+1
⌋
th
position after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example,
median([3,1,4])=3,
median([3,1,4,2])=2. (Here
⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer which does not exceed
x).
Input Format
The first line contains

The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can divide the array into following two subsets:
P=[2,8],Q=[7,4,2], which has
∣median(P)−median(Q)∣=∣2−4∣=2. It can be proven that the answer can not be improved further.
Test case
2: We can divide the array into following two subsets:
P=[1,3],Q=[2], which has
∣median(P)−median(Q)∣=∣1−2∣=1. It can be proven that the answer can not be improved further.
Test case
3: Observe that, for any partition of the array into any two non-empty subsets, the median of both the subsets will be
1. Therefore the answer is
∣1−1∣=0.
