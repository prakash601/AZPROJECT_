Chef has two integers
A and
B
(A≤B).
Chef can choose any non-negative integer
X and add them to both
A and
B. Find whether it is possible to make
A a divisor of
B.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to make
A a factor of
B, NO otherwise.
You can print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings Yes, YES, yes, and yEs, are all considered identical.

YES
YES
NO
Explanation:
Test case
1: We can choose
X=0 and add them to
3 and
6. Thus,
3 is a factor of
6.
Test case
2: We can choose
X=1 and add them to
4 and
14. Thus,
4+1=5 is a factor of
14+1=15.
Test case
3: There is no possible value of
X to add such that
A becomes a factor of
B.
