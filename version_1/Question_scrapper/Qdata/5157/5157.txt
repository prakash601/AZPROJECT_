You are given an array
A of
N integers. You must perform some (possibly zero) operations to make the elements of
A distinct.
In one operation, you can either:
Remove one element from the beginning of the array
A and append any positive integer to the end.
Or remove one element from the end of the array
A and prepend any positive integer to the beginning.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array distinct.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Test case
1: Initially
A=[1,3,3,5,1,2,4,1]. Consider the following sequence of operations.
[1,3,3,5,1,2,4,

[3,5,1,2,4,7,8,9]
All the elements of
A are now distinct. It can be shown that it is not possible in less than
4 operations.
Test case
2: No operations are required since all the elements of
A are already distinct.
