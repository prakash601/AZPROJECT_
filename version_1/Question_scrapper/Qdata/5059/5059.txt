Chef found a matrix
A with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
M columns (numbered
1 through
M), where for each row
r and column
c, the cell in row
r and column
c (denoted by
(r,c)) contains an integer
A
r,c
.
This matrix has two interesting properties:
The integers in each row form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for each valid
i,
A
i,1
≤A
i,2
≤…≤A
i,M
.
The integers in each column also form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for each valid
j,
A
1,j
≤A
2,j
≤…≤A
N,j
.
A
K-worthy submatrix is a square submatrix of
A, i.e. a submatrix with
l rows and
l columns, for any integer
l, such that the average of all the integers in this submatrix is
≥K.
Chef wants you to find the number of
K-worthy submatrices of
A.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
K.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,A
i,3
,…,A
i,M
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of
K-worthy submatrices of
A.
