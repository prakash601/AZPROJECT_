Consider a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, where initially,
A
i
=i for each valid
i. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose two valid indices
i and
j, compute the greatest common divisor of
A
i
and
A
j
(let's denote it by
g), and change both
A
i
and
A
j
to
g.
You are given a sequence
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
. Is it possible to obtain this sequence, i.e. change
A to
B, using the given operations?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain
A=B or "NO" if it is impossible.
Constraints
1≤N≤10
4
1≤B
i
≤i for each valid
i
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points):
N≤4
Subtask #2 (20 points): there is at most one valid index
p such that
B
p

=p
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

YES
Explanation:
Example case 1: We cannot make the third element of the sequence
(1,2,3) become
2.
Example case 2: We can perform one operation with
(i,j)=(2,4), which changes the sequence
(1,2,3,4) to
(1,2,3,2).
