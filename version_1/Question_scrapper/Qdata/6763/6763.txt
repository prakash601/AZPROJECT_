It's not always easy to make up stories around problems ― like this one.
We know that there is a hidden sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
which contains only integers between
1 and
K inclusive. We have acquired
M triplets
(X
1
,Y
1
,Z
1
),(X
2
,Y
2
,Z
2
),…,(X
M
,Y
M
,Z
M
). A very reliable source has given us intel that for each valid
i, the
Y
i
-th occurrence of the integer
X
i
in the sequence
A is
A
Z
i
, i.e.
A
Z
i
=X
i
and there are
Y
i
−1 indices
j<Z
i
such that
A
j
=X
i
.
Find any sequence
A consistent with this information or determine that no such sequence exists.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
K and
M.
M lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤M), the
i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers
X
i
,Y
i
and
Z
i
.
Output
For each test case:
If no valid sequence exists, print a single line containing the string "No".
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain the string "Yes".
The second line should contain
N space-separated integers
A
