Chef is playing a game on the non-negative x-axis. It takes him
1 second to reach from
i
th
position to
(i−1)
th
position or
(i+1)
th
position. The chef never goes to the negative x-axis. Also, Chef doesn't stop at any moment of time.
The movement of chef can be described as follows.
At the start he is standing at
x=0 at time
0.
In the first round, he moves towards
x=1 and comes back to the
x=0 position.
In the second round, he moves towards the
x=2 and comes back again to
x=0.
Generalizing, in the
k
th
round, he moves from
x=0 to
x=k and then returns back to
x=0 at the end of the round. This goes on as the game progresses.
For Example, the path of Chef for
3
rd
round is given below.
0−1−2−3−2−1−0
The overall path followed by Chef would look somewhat like this:
0−1−0−1−2−1−0−1−2−3−2−1−0−1−2−3−4−3−…
You are given two non-negative integers
N and
K. You have to tell the time at which Chef arrives at
x=N for the
K
th
time.
Note - Chef can not skip a position while visiting the positions.
###Input:
The first line contains
T the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of two integers
N and
K.
###Output: For each test case, print a single line containing one integer -- the time taken by the chef to arrive at
x=N for the
K
th
time by modulo
1,000,000,007.

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
Chef starts the journey from the
N=0 at time
t=0 and it's the first time
(K=1), he is here. So, the answer is
0.
Test Case 2:
Chef starts the journey from the
N=0 at time
t=0 then goes to
N=1 at
t=1 and it's the first time
(K=1), he is here. So, the answer is
1.
Test Case 4:
The path followed by Chef to reach
1 for the third time is given below.
0−1−0−1−2−1
He reaches
1 for the third time at
t=5.
