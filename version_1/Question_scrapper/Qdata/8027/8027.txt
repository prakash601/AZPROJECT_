ChthollyNotaSeniorious gives DataStructures a number axis with
m
distinct segments on it. Let
f(l,r)
be the number of ways to choose an even number of segments such that the union of them is exactly
[l,r]
, and
g(l,r)
be the number of ways to choose an odd number of segments such that the union of them is exactly
[l,r]
.
ChthollyNotaSeniorious asked DataStructures
q
questions. In each query, ChthollyNotaSeniorious will give DataStructures two numbers
l,r
, and now he wishes that you can help him find the value
f(l,r)−g(l,r)
modulo
998244353
so that he wouldn't let her down.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
m
(
1≤m≤2⋅105
) and
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅105
)  — the number of segments and queries, correspondingly.
The
i
-th of the next
m
lines contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi<yi≤109
), denoting a segment
[xi,yi]
.
It is guaranteed that all segments are distinct. More formally, there do not exist two numbers
i,j
with
1≤i<j≤m
such that
xi=xj
and
yi=yj
.
The
i
-th of the next
q
lines contains two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li<ri≤109
), describing a query.
Output
For each query, output a single integer  —
f(li,ri)−g(li,ri)
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first query, we have to find
f(1,4)−g(1,4)
. The only subset of segments with union
[1,4]
is
{[1,3],[2,4]}
, so
f(1,4)=1,g(1,4)=0
.
In the second query, we have to find
f(1,5)−g(1,5)
. The only subsets of segments with union
[1,5]
are
{[1,3],[2,4],[3,5]}
and
{[1,3],[3,5]}
, so
f(1,5)=1,g(1,5)=1
.
