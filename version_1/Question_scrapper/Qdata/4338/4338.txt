Chef is given an array
A consisting of
N positive integers. Chef shuffles the array
A and creates a new array
B of length
N, where
B
i
=(A
i
+i)mod2, for each
i(1≤i≤N).
Find the maximum possible sum of integers of the array
B, if Chef shuffles the array
A optimally.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum sum of integers of the array
B.

Explanation:
Test case
1: One of the optimal ways to shuffle the array
A is
[2,1,3]. Then the array
B=[(2+1)mod2,(1+2)mod2,(3+3)mod2]=[1,1,0]. So the sum of integers of array
B is
2. There is no other possible way to shuffle array
A such that the sum of integers of array
B becomes greater than
2.
Test case
2: One of the optimal ways to shuffle the array
A is
[2,5,4]. Then the array
B=[(2+1)mod2,(5+2)mod2,(4+3)mod2]=[1,1,1]. So the sum of integers of array
B is
