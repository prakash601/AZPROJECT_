Sereja has an undirected graph consisting of
N vertices and
M edges. Sereja is interested in one question: is it possible to delete edges from the graph in a way such that the degree of each vertex in the final graph is exactly
1?
The degree of any vertex in the graph is defined as the number of edges connected to that vertex.
Please help Sereja.
Input
The first line contains a single integer -
T, the number of test cases.
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers -
N and
M. The description of the edges follows.
The next
M lines contain two space separated integers —
U and
V - representing an edge connecting vertex
U and vertex
V.
Output
For each test case print YES if it is possible, otherwise print NO.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N,M≤100
1≤U,V≤N
There can be multiple edges but no self loops in the graph.
