Consider any two sets of integers strictly larger than
1, denoted by
P and
Q. The set
P is said to be divisible by
Q if each integer in
P is divisible by at least one (not necessarily the same for each of them) integer in
Q.
You are given a set
A={A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
}, where
A
i
≤C for each valid
i (note that
C does not necessarily equal
max(A)). Find any set
B={B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
} such that:
A is divisible by
B
2≤B
i
≤C for each valid
i
M is the smallest positive integer such that there is at least one set satisfying the previous two conditions
If there are multiple answers, you may find any one of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
C.
The second line contains
N distinct space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer
M. The second line should contain
M space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
satisfying the given conditions.
