Let
f(X) denote the number of set bits in
X.
Given integers
N and
K, construct an array
A of length
N such that:
0≤A
i
≤K for all
(1≤i≤N);
∑
i=1
N
A
i
=K
Over all such possible arrays, find the maximum value of
∑
i=1
N
f(A
i
).
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains integers
N and
K- the length of the array and sum of elements respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum value of
∑
i=1
N
f(A
i
).

Explanation:
Test case
1: Only one array is possible that is
A=[7]. As
7=(111)
2
, the number of set bits in
7 is
3. Thus,
∑
i=1
N
f(A
i
)=f(7)=3.
Test case
2: A possible array satisfying all the conditions is
A=[3,0,3]. As
3=(11)
2
, the number of set bits in
3 is
2. Similarly, the number of set bits in
0 is
0. Thus,
∑
i=1
N
f(A
i
)=f(3)+f(0)+f(3)=4. It can be proven that answer never exceeds
4.
