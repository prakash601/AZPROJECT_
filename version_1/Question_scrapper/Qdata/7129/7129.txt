For two strings
A and
B with the same length
N, we will say that they are equivalent if the following rule holds: For each pair of integers
l and
r (
1≤l≤r≤N), the substring of
A between the
l-th and
r-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome if and only if the substring of
B between the
l-th and
r-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome.
You are given a string
S with length
N. Find the number of sets
P⊂{1,2,…,N} such that there is a character
c and a string
X which is equivalent to
S and satisfies
X
p
=c for each
p∈P. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string
S with length
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of subsets of characters that can be equal to each other in some string equivalent to
S, modulo
998,244,353.
Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤2,000
S contains only lowercase Latin letters
