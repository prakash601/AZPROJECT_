Given a string S, your task is to find the number of patterns of form 1[0]1 where [0] represents any number of zeroes (minimum requirement is one 0) there should not be any other character except 0 in the [0] sequence.

Example 1:
Input:
S = "100001abc101"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The two patterns are "100001" and "101".

Example 2:
Input:
S = "1001ab010abc01001"
2
Explanation:
The two patterns are "1001"(at start)
and "1001"(at end).

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function patternCount() which takes a single argument(string S) and returns the count of patterns. You need not take any input or print anything.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=Length of String<=10^5
