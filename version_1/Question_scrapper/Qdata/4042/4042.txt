Given an even integer
N, output a permutation
P of length
N, such that:
The value of
P
i
+P
N+1−i
is distinct for all
1≤i≤
2
N
.
It is guaranteed that a possible solution always exists. If multiple such permutations exist, print any.
Note that, a permutation
P of length
N, consists of all integers from
1 to
N exactly once. For example,
[2,1,3,4] is a permutation, while
[2,2,1,3] is not.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing a single even integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N space-separated integers, denoting the permutation
P of length
N.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤2000
N is even.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider the permutation
P=[2,1].
The value
P
i
+P
N+1−i
=2+1=3 for
i=1, which is distinct.
Test case
2: Consider the permutation
P=[1,3,2,4,5,6].
For
i=1: The value
P
i
+P
N+1−i
=1+6=7.
For
i=2: The value
P
i
+P
N+1−i
=3+5=8.
For
i=3: The value
P
i
+P
N+1−i
=2+4=6.
Thus, the values are distinct for each
1≤i≤
2
N
.
Test case
3: Consider the permutation
P=[2,1,3,4].
For
i=1: The value
P
i
+P
N+1−i
=2+4=6.
For
i=2: The value
P
i
+P
N+1−i
=1+3=4.
Thus, the values are distinct for each
1≤i≤
2
N
.
