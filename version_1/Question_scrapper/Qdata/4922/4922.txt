At ShareChat, there are are plenty of interesting problems to solve. Here is one of them.
Given integers
A,
B and
N, you should calculate the GCD of
A
N
+B
N
and
∣A−B∣. (Assume that
GCD(0,a)=a for any positive integer
a). Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo
1000000007 (
10
9
+7).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
A,
B and
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the required GCD modulo
10
9
+7.
