Chef has an array
A of length
N.
In one operation, Chef can:
Choose any two distinct indices
i,j
(1≤i,j≤N) and change both
A
i
and
A
j
to
(A
i
+A
j
). Note that both the elements
A
i
and
A
j
are getting replaced by the same value.
Find the minimum number of operations required by Chef to make all the elements divisible by
3.
It is guaranteed that we can make all the elements divisible by
3 using some finite number of operations.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can make all the elements divisible by
3 using
2 operations.
Operation
1: Choose
i=1 and
j=2. Thus, we replace both
A
1
and
A
2
by
A
1
+A
2
=4+8=12. The array becomes
[12,12,20,16].
Operation
2: Choose
i=3 and
j=4. Thus, we replace both
A
3
and
A
4
by
A
3
+A
4
=20+16=36. The array becomes
[12,12,36,36].
All elements of the array are divisible by
3. It can be shown that this is the minimum number of operations required to do so.
Test case
2: We can make all the elements divisible by
3 using
6 operations.
Operation
1: Choose
i=1 and
j=2. Thus, we replace both
A
1
and
A
2
by
A
1
+A
2
=4+3=7. The array becomes
[7,7,6,9].
Operation
2: Choose
i=1 and
j=3. Thus, we replace both
A
1
and
A
3
by
A
1
+A
3
=7+6=13. The array becomes
[13,7,13,9].
Operation
3: Choose
i=1 and
j=2. Thus, we replace both
A
1
and
A
2
by
A
1
+A
2
=13+7=20. The array becomes
[20,20,13,9].
Operation
4: Choose
i=3 and
j=4. Thus, we replace both
A
3
and
A
4
by
A
3
+A
4
=13+9=22. The array becomes
[20,20,22,22].
Operation
5: Choose
i=1 and
j=3. Thus, we replace both
A
1
and
A
3
by
A
1
+A
3
=20+22=42. The array becomes
[42,20,42,22].
Operation
6: Choose
i=2 and
j=4. Thus, we replace both
A
2
and
A
4
by
A
2
+A
4
=20+22=42. The array becomes
[42,42,42,42].
All elements of the array are divisible by
3. It can be shown that this is the minimum number of operations required to do so.
