Chef has a garden containing
N cells. The
i-th cell has
R
i
red flowers and
B
i
blue flowers. Chef can collect only one type of flowers (either red or blue) from each cell.
Let
X denote the total number of red flowers Chef collects and
Y denote the total number of blue flowers Chef collects. Chef wants to maximize the value of
min(X,Y). Can you help Chef?
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of cells in Chef's garden.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case 1: If Chef collects
101 red flowers from the cell, Chef will have a total of
101 red flowers
(X=101) and
0 blue flowers
(Y=0).
If Chef collects the
3 blue flowers from the cell, Chef will have a total of
0 red flowers
(X=0) and
3 blue flowers
(Y=3).
Either way,
min(X,Y)=0, the answer is
0.
Test case 2: Chef collects the
199 blue flowers from the first cell and the
200 red flowers from the second cell, so
min(X,Y)=199, which is maximum.
Test case 3: Chef collects blue cells from the first three cells
(Y=3+1+3) and red flowers from the fourth cell
(X=10), so
min(X,Y)=7, which is maximum.
