Alice and Bob created
N and
M recipes, respectively (
N,M≥1), and submitted them to Chef for evaluation. Each recipe is represented by a string containing only lowercase English letters. Let's denote Alice's recipes by
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and Bob's recipes by
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
M
.
Accidentally, Chef mixed up those recipes ― now, he has
L=N+M recipes in a sequence
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
L
. Thankfully, the recipes created by Alice and Bob are distinguishable from each other. It is well-known that for each recipe
s created by Alice, the following property holds, and for each recipe created by Bob, it does not hold: For each
1≤l<r≤∣s∣, the substring
s
l
s
l+1
s
r
contains at least as many vowels as consonants. The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are vowels, while the other letters are consonants.
The score of a candidate who made
K recipes is calculated as the product of
fx
c
K
x
c
for all letters
c that occur in at least one of these recipes; here,
x
c
is the number of recipes which contain the letter
c and
fx
c
is the total number of occurrences of this letter in all
K recipes.
Let's denote the scores of Alice and Bob by
sc
A
and
sc
B
respectively. Chef wants to know their ratio
sc
A
/sc
B
. We know that Chef is a legendary cook, but he is not very good at calculating, so he is asking you to find that number.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
L.
L lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains a single string
S
i
.
Output
For each test case, if the ratio of scores exceeds
10
7
, print a single line containing the string "Infinity" (without quotes); otherwise, print a single line containing one real number
sc
A
/sc
B
.
Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
. It is guaranteed that
sc
A
/sc
B
does not lie in the range
10
7
±10.
