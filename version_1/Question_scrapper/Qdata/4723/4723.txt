You are given
N binary strings of length
N each. You need to find a binary string of length
N which is different from all of the given strings.
Note:
A binary string is defined as a string consisting only of '0' and '1'.
A string is considered different from another string when they have different lengths, or when they differ in at least one position.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the number of strings and length of strings.
Each of the next
N lines contains a binary string of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print on one line a binary string of length
N, which is different from all of the given strings. If there are multiple possible answers, print any.
