You are given an array
a
with
n
non-negative integers. You can apply the following operation on it.
Choose two indices
l
and
r
(
1≤l<r≤n
).
If
al+ar
is odd, do
ar:=al
. If
al+ar
is even, do
al:=ar
.
Find any sequence of at most
n
operations that makes
a
non-decreasing. It can be proven that it is always possible. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.
An array
a1,a2,…,an
is non-decreasing if and only if
a1≤a2≤…≤an
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
)  — the array itself.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer
m
(
0≤m≤n
), the number of operations, in the first line.
Then print
m
lines. Each line must contain two integers
li,ri
, which are the indices you chose in the
i
-th operation (
1≤li<ri≤n
).
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Note
In the second test case,
a
changes like this:
Select indices
3
and
4
.
a3+a4=3
is odd, so do
a4:=a3
.
a=[1,1000000000,3,3,5]
now.
Select indices
1
and
2
.
a1+a2=1000000001
is odd, so do
a2:=a1
.
a=[1,1,3,3,5]
now, and it is non-decreasing.
In the first and third test cases,
a
is already non-decreasing.
