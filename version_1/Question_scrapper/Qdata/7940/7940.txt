You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
of
n
integers. Consider
S
as a set of segments satisfying the following conditions.
Each element of
S
should be in form
[x,y]
, where
x
and
y
are integers between
1
and
n
, inclusive, and
x≤y
.
No two segments in
S
intersect with each other. Two segments
[a,b]
and
[c,d]
intersect if and only if there exists an integer
x
such that
a≤x≤b
and
c≤x≤d
.
For each
[x,y]
in
S
,
ax+ax+1+…+ay≥0
.
The length of the segment
[x,y]
is defined as
y−x+1
.
f(S)
is defined as the sum of the lengths of every element in
S
. In a formal way,
f(S)=∑[x,y]∈S(y−x+1)
. Note that if
S
is empty,
f(S)
is
0
.
What is the maximum
f(S)
among all possible
S
?
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
).
The next line is followed by
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
Output
Print a single integer, the maximum
f(S)
among every possible
S
.

Note
In the first example,
S={[1,2],[4,5]}
can be a possible
S
because
a1+a2=0
and
a4+a5=1
.
S={[1,4]}
can also be a possible solution.
Since there does not exist any
S
that satisfies
f(S)>4
, the answer is
4
.
In the second example,
S={[1,9]}
is the only set that satisfies
f(S)=9
. Since every possible
S
satisfies
f(S)≤9
, the answer is
9
.
In the third example,
S
can only be an empty set, so the answer is
0
.
