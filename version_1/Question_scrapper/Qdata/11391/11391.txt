Recently Lynyrd and Skynyrd went to a shop where Lynyrd bought a permutation
𝑝
of length
𝑛
, and Skynyrd bought an array
𝑎
of length
𝑚
, consisting of integers from
1
to
𝑛
.
Lynyrd and Skynyrd became bored, so they asked you
𝑞
queries, each of which has the following form: "does the subsegment of
𝑎
from the
𝑙
-th to the
𝑟
-th positions, inclusive, have a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of
𝑝
?" Please answer the queries.
A permutation of length
𝑛
is a sequence of
𝑛
integers such that each integer from
1
to
𝑛
appears exactly once in it.
A cyclic shift of a permutation
(
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,…,
𝑝
𝑛
)
is a permutation
(
𝑝
𝑖
,
𝑝
𝑖+1
,…,
𝑝
𝑛
,
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,…,
𝑝
𝑖−1
)
for some
𝑖
from
1
to
𝑛
. For example, a permutation
(2,1,3)
has three distinct cyclic shifts:
(2,1,3)
,
(1,3,2)
,
(3,2,1)
.
A subsequence of a subsegment of array
𝑎
from the
𝑙
-th to the
𝑟
-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence
𝑎
𝑖
1
,
𝑎
𝑖
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑖
𝑘
for some
𝑖
1
,
𝑖
2
,…,
𝑖
𝑘
such that
𝑙≤
𝑖
1
<
𝑖
2
<…<
𝑖
𝑘
≤𝑟
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
𝑛
,
𝑚
,
𝑞
(
1≤𝑛,𝑚,𝑞≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the permutation
𝑝
, the length of the array
𝑎
and the number of queries.
The next line contains
𝑛
integers from
1
to
𝑛
, where the
𝑖
-th of them is the
𝑖
-th element of the permutation. Each integer from
1
to
𝑛
appears exactly once.
The next line contains
𝑚
integers from
1
to
𝑛
, the
𝑖
-th of them is the
𝑖
-th element of the array
𝑎
.
The next
𝑞
lines describe queries. The
𝑖
-th of these lines contains two integers
𝑙
𝑖
and
𝑟
𝑖
(
1≤
𝑙
𝑖
≤
𝑟
𝑖
≤𝑚
), meaning that the
𝑖
-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the
𝑙
𝑖
-th to the
𝑟
𝑖
-th positions, inclusive.
Output
Print a single string of length
𝑞
, consisting of
0
and
1
, the digit on the
𝑖
-th positions should be
1
, if the subsegment of array
𝑎
from the
𝑙
𝑖
-th to the
𝑟
𝑖
-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of
𝑝
, and
0
otherwise.

Note
In the first example the segment from the
1
-st to the
5
-th positions is
1,2,3,1,2
. There is a subsequence
1,3,2
that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the
2
-nd to the
6
-th positions also contains a subsequence
2,1,3
that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the
3
-rd to the
5
-th positions is
3,1,2
, there is only one subsequence of length
3
(
3,1,2
), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation.
In the second example the possible cyclic shifts are
1,2
and
2,1
. The subsegment from the
1
-st to the
2
-nd positions is
1,1
, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation. The subsegment from the
2
-nd to the
3
-rd positions is
1,2
, it coincides with the permutation. The subsegment from the
3
to the
4
positions is
2,2
, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation.
