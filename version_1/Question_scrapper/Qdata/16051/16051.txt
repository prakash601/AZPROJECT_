A flea is sitting at one of the n hassocks, arranged in a circle, at the moment. After minute number k the flea jumps through k - 1 hassoсks (clockwise). For example, after the first minute the flea jumps to the neighboring hassock. You should answer: will the flea visit all the hassocks or not. We assume that flea has infinitely much time for this jumping.
