Given N dice each with M faces, numbered from 1 to M, find the number of ways to get sum X. X is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.
  Example 1:
Input:
M = 6, N = 3, X = 12
Output:
25
Explanation:
There are 25 total ways to get
the Sum 12 using 3 dices with
faces from 1 to 6.
Example 2:
Input:
M = 2, N = 3, X = 6
Output:
1
Explanation:
There is only 1 way to get
the Sum 6 using 3 dices with
faces from 1 to 2. All the
dices will have to land on 2.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function noOfWays() which takes 3 Integers M,N and X as input and returns the answer.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(M*N*X)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*X)
  Constraints:
1 <= M,N,X <= 50
