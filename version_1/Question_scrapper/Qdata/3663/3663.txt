Chef is given two integers
A and
C such that
A≤C.
Chef wants to find whether there exists any integer
B such that
A,B, and
C are in arithmetic progression.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
A and
C, the given integers.
Output Format
For each test case, output
−1 if there exists no integer
B such that
A,B, and
C are in arithmetic progression. Else, output the value of
B.
Constraints
1≤T≤60
1≤A≤C≤10

Explanation:
Test case
1: Considering
B=4, the three integers are in arithmetic progression as
B−A=C−B=1.
Test case
2: Considering
B=6, the three integers are in arithmetic progression as
B−A=C−B=0.
Test case
3: There exists no integral value of
B such that
A,B, and
C are in arithmetic progression.
Test case
4: Considering
B=5, the three integers are in arithmetic progression as
B−A=C−B=4.
