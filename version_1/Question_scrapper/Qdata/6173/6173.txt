You are given an array
A of
N integers . You want to convert the array
A into a permutation of
N integers. To do this, you can apply the following operation on array
A exactly once .
Pick an integer
X, where
1≤X≤2⋅10
7
. For each
i ,
1≤i≤N , replace
A
i
by
A
i
%X.
Find out whether it is possible to convert
A into a permutation of
N integers. If it is possible, print YES (all uppercase alphabets) and any possible value of
X for which it is possible. Otherwise, print NO (all uppercase alphabets).
Note - An array of
N integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the required answer in a single line. If an answer exists, print YES and an integer
X
(1≤X≤2⋅10
7
) separated by a single space. Otherwise, print NO.
Note that the strings are case-sensitive and must be in uppercase alphabets.

Explanation:
In the first case, choosing
X=4 yields
A as
[2%4,7%4,1%4]=[2,3,1] which is a permutation of
N=3.
In the second case, we can't make
A
i
=
1 for any
i and for any value of
X.
