You are given two arrays
a1,a2,…,an
and
b1,b2,…,bn
.
In one operation, you can choose any integer
i
from
1
to
n
and swap the numbers
ai
and
bi
.
Determine whether, after using any (possibly zero) number of operations, the following two conditions can be satisfied simultaneously:
an=max(a1,a2,…,an)
,
bn=max(b1,b2,…,bn)
.
Here
max(c1,c2,…,ck)
denotes the maximum number among
c1,c2,…,ck
. For example,
max(3,5,4)=5
,
max(1,7,7)=7
,
max(6,2)=6
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤200
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the length of the arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤100
) — elements of the first array.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤100
) — elements of the second array.
Output
For each test case, print "Yes" if after using any (possibly zero) number of operations the conditions described above are satisfied. Otherwise, print "No".
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

Note
In the first test case, you can swap the numbers
a3
and
b3
, after which the array
a
becomes equal to
[7,9,9]
, and the array
b
becomes equal to
[7,6,7]
, and both conditions are met.
In the second test case, it can be proved that it is impossible to satisfy both conditions.
In the third test case, you can swap the numbers
a1
and
b1
, after which the array
a
becomes equal to
[99,99]
, and the array
b
becomes equal to
[100,100]
, and both conditions are satisfied.
In fifth test case, you can swap
a7
and
b7
,
a8
and
b8
,
a9
and
b9
, after which the array
a
becomes equal to
[1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6]
, and the array
b
becomes equal to
[9,9,9,9,9,9,7,8,9]
, and both conditions are satisfied.
