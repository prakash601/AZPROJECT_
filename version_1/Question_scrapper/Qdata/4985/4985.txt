You are given two strings
S and
A of lengths
N and
M respectively.
String
S contains characters from the set
{?, a, b, c, d, e}.
String
A contains characters from the set
{a, b, c, d, e}.
Let
S
′
denote the string formed by replacing all the
? in
S using the characters from the set
{a, b, c, d, e}.
Construct
S
′
such that
A is not a subsequence of
S
′
.
If multiple such
S
′
exist, output any. If no such
S
′
exists, print
−1.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
and
- the lengths of strings
S and
A respectively.
The second line of each test case contains string
S.
The third line of each test case contains string
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output any valid string
S
′
. If no such string exists, print
−1.
Constraints

Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅10

.
Sum of
M over all test cases does not exceed

Explanation:
Test case
1: Replace the
? at indices
1 and
4 using characters
a and
e respectively. Both the characters belong to the set
{a, b, c, d, e}.
The string
S
′
=aabe. Note that no subsequence of
S
′
is equal to
ba.
Test case
2: There is no possible value of
S
′
such that
ab is not a subsequence of
S
′
.
