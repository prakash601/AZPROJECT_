,…,A
N
such that the following conditions are satisfied:
1≤N≤10
5
1≤A
i
≤10

for each valid
i
∑
i=1

))=D
It can be proved that a solution always exists under the given constraints.
Note:
GCD(B
1

.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
D.
Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer
N. The second line should contain
N space-separated integers
