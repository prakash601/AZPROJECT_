You are given a non-decreasing array of non-negative integers
a1,a2,…,an
. Also you are given a positive integer
k
.
You want to find
m
non-decreasing arrays of non-negative integers
b1,b2,…,bm
, such that:
The size of
bi
is equal to
n
for all
1≤i≤m
.
For all
1≤j≤n
,
aj=b1,j+b2,j+…+bm,j
. In the other word, array
a
is the sum of arrays
bi
.
The number of different elements in the array
bi
is at most
k
for all
1≤i≤m
.
Find the minimum possible value of
m
, or report that there is no possible
m
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
): the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
k
(
1≤n≤100
,
1≤k≤n
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤a1≤a2≤…≤an≤100
,
an>0
).
Output
For each test case print a single integer: the minimum possible value of
m
. If there is no such
m
, print
−1
.

Note
In the first test case, there is no possible
m
, because all elements of all arrays should be equal to
0
. But in this case, it is impossible to get
a4=1
as the sum of zeros.
In the second test case, we can take
b1=[3,3,3]
.
1
is the smallest possible value of
m
.
In the third test case, we can take
b1=[0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
and
b2=[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2]
. It's easy to see, that
ai=b1,i+b2,i
for all
i
and the number of different elements in
b1
and in
b2
is equal to
3
(so it is at most
3
). It can be proven that
2
is the smallest possible value of
m
.
