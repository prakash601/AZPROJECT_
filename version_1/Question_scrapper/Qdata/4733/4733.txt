Sasuke and Itachi are playing a game. Sasuke first creates an array
A containing
N positive integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. He then creates a new array
B of length
N such that
B
i
=gcd(A
1
,A
2
,...,A
i
) for each
1≤i≤N. Now, Sasuke gives array
B to Itachi and asks him to find any array
A (with
1≤A
i
≤10
9
) such that the given process applied to
A will produce
B. Can you help Itachi solve this problem?
Here,
gcd stands for greatest common divisor.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
B

,B
2
,…,B
N
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers denoting the array
A you constructed. If no such array
A exists, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: One possible answer is
[4,26] because
B can be generated as follows:
B=[gcd(4),gcd(4,26)]=[4,2].
Test Case 2: It can be shown that no array
A exists which can produce the given
B.
