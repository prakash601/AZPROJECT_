You're given a tree with
n
vertices. The color of the
i
-th vertex is
hi
.
The value of the tree is defined as
∑
hi=hj,1≤i<j≤n
dis(i,j)
, where
dis(i,j)
is the number of edges on the shortest path between
i
and
j
.
The color of each vertex is lost, you only remember that
hi
can be any integer from
[li,ri]
(inclusive). You want to calculate the sum of values of all trees meeting these conditions modulo
109+7
(the set of edges is fixed, but each color is unknown, so there are
n
∏
i=1
(ri−li+1)
different trees).
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
) — the number of vertices.
Then
n
lines follow, each line contains two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤105
) denoting the range of possible colors of vertex
i
.
Then
n−1
lines follow, each containing two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
,
u≠v
) denoting an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.
Output
Print one integer — the sum of values of all possible trees, taken modulo
109+7
.

Note
In the first example there are four different ways to color the tree (so, there are four different trees):
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,1,1,1}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,2)+dis(1,3)+dis(1,4)+dis(2,3)+dis(2,4)+dis(3,4)=10
;
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,2,1,1}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,3)+dis(1,4)+dis(3,4)=4
;
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,1,1,2}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,2)+dis(1,3)+dis(2,3)=4
;
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,2,1,2}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,3)+dis(2,4)=4
.
Overall the sum of all values is
10+4+4+4=22
.
