You are given an array
A of length
N.
Determine the count of subarrays of
A which contain their length as an element.
Formally, count the number of pairs
(L,R)
(1≤L≤R≤N) such that:
(R−L+1)∈{A
L
,A
L+1
,…,A
R
}.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer
N denoting the length of the array
A.
Second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
,
,…,
N
- denoting the array
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the count of subarrays containing their lengths.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: There are
4 subarrays
(i,j) containing their lengths. They are
(1,1),(1,2),(2,3), and
(3,3).
Test Case
2: There are
6 subarrays
(i,j) containing their lengths. They are
(1,2),(1,3),(1,5),(2,4),(3,3), and
(3,5).
