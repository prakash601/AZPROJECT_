Allen and Bessie are playing a simple number game. They both know a function
f:{0,1}n→R
, i. e. the function takes
n
binary arguments and returns a real value. At the start of the game, the variables
x1,x2,…,xn
are all set to
−1
. Each round, with equal probability, one of Allen or Bessie gets to make a move. A move consists of picking an
i
such that
xi=−1
and either setting
xi→0
or
xi→1
.
After
n
rounds all variables are set, and the game value resolves to
f(x1,x2,…,xn)
. Allen wants to maximize the game value, and Bessie wants to minimize it.
Your goal is to help Allen and Bessie find the expected game value! They will play
r+1
times though, so between each game, exactly one value of
f
changes. In other words, between rounds
i
and
i+1
for
1≤i≤r
,
f(z1,…,zn)→gi
for some
(z1,…,zn)∈{0,1}n
. You are to find the expected game value in the beginning and after each change.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
r
(
1≤n≤18
,
0≤r≤218
).
The next line contains
2n
integers
c0,c1,…,c2n−1
(
0≤ci≤109
), denoting the initial values of
f
. More specifically,
f(x0,x1,…,xn−1)=cx
, if
x=
¯
xn−1…x0
in binary.
Each of the next
r
lines contains two integers
z
and
g
(
0≤z≤2n−1
,
0≤g≤109
). If
z=
¯
zn−1…z0
in binary, then this means to set
f(z0,…,zn−1)→g
.
Output
Print
r+1
lines, the
i
-th of which denotes the value of the game
f
during the
i
-th round. Your answer must have absolute or relative error within
10−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is considered correct if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤10−6
.

Note
Consider the second test case. If Allen goes first, he will set
x1→1
, so the final value will be
3
. If Bessie goes first, then she will set
x1→0
so the final value will be
2
. Thus the answer is
2.5
.
In the third test case, the game value will always be
1
regardless of Allen and Bessie's play.
