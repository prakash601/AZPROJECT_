Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is planning to go for a famous restaurant — "Alice's".
The restaurant "Alice's" serves
n
kinds of food. The cost for the
i
-th kind is always
ci
. Initially, the restaurant has enough ingredients for serving exactly
ai
dishes of the
i
-th kind. In the New Year's Eve,
m
customers will visit Alice's one after another and the
j
-th customer will order
dj
dishes of the
tj
-th kind of food. The
(i+1)
-st customer will only come after the
i
-th customer is completely served.
Suppose there are
ri
dishes of the
i
-th kind remaining (initially
ri=ai
). When a customer orders
1
dish of the
i
-th kind, the following principles will be processed.
If
ri>0
, the customer will be served exactly
1
dish of the
i
-th kind. The cost for the dish is
ci
. Meanwhile,
ri
will be reduced by
1
.
Otherwise, the customer will be served
1
dish of the cheapest available kind of food if there are any. If there are multiple cheapest kinds of food, the one with the smallest index among the cheapest will be served. The cost will be the cost for the dish served and the remain for the corresponding dish will be reduced by
1
.
If there are no more dishes at all, the customer will leave angrily. Therefore, no matter how many dishes are served previously, the cost for the customer is
0
.
If the customer doesn't leave after the
dj
dishes are served, the cost for the customer will be the sum of the cost for these
dj
dishes.
Please determine the total cost for each of the
m
customers.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤105
), representing the number of different kinds of food and the number of customers, respectively.
The second line contains
n
positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤107
), where
ai
denotes the initial remain of the
i
-th kind of dishes.
The third line contains
n
positive integers
c1,c2,…,cn
(
1≤ci≤106
), where
ci
denotes the cost of one dish of the
i
-th kind.
The following
m
lines describe the orders of the
m
customers respectively. The
j
-th line contains two positive integers
tj
and
dj
(
1≤tj≤n
,
1≤dj≤107
), representing the kind of food and the number of dishes the
j
-th customer orders, respectively.
Output
Print
m
lines. In the
j
-th line print the cost for the
j
-th customer.

Note
In the first sample,
5
customers will be served as follows.
Customer
1
will be served
6
dishes of the
2
-nd kind,
1
dish of the
4
-th kind, and
1
dish of the
6
-th kind. The cost is
6⋅3+1⋅2+1⋅2=22
. The remain of the
8
kinds of food will be
{8,0,2,0,4,4,7,5}
.
Customer
2
will be served
4
dishes of the
1
-st kind. The cost is
4⋅6=24
. The remain will be
{4,0,2,0,4,4,7,5}
.
Customer
3
will be served
4
dishes of the
6
-th kind,
3
dishes of the
8
-th kind. The cost is
4⋅2+3⋅2=14
. The remain will be
{4,0,2,0,4,0,7,2}
.
Customer
4
will be served
2
dishes of the
3
-rd kind,
2
dishes of the
8
-th kind. The cost is
2⋅3+2⋅2=10
. The remain will be
{4,0,0,0,4,0,7,0}
.
Customer
5
will be served
7
dishes of the
7
-th kind,
3
dishes of the
1
-st kind. The cost is
7⋅3+3⋅6=39
. The remain will be
{1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0}
.
In the second sample, each customer is served what they order except the last one, who leaves angrily without paying. For example, the second customer is served
6
dishes of the second kind, so the cost is
66⋅6=396
.
In the third sample, some customers may not be served what they order. For example, the second customer is served
6
dishes of the second kind,
6
of the third and
1
of the fourth, so the cost is
66⋅6+666⋅6+6666⋅1=11058
.
