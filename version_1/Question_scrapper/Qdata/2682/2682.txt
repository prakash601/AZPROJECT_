For a given array of price of items,you have to calculate the average of all prices upto 2 decimal places.
Note: Sum is printed automatically, you only need to calculate and return the average
  Example 1:
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
15 3.00 
Explanation:
Sum of the array is 15, hence 
average is 15/5=3.00. 

Input:
9
2 55 85 656 52 554 545 5 2
Output:
1956 217.33 
Explanation:
Sum of the array is 1956, hence 
average is 1956/9= 217.33. 
  Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function average() which takes the array A[] and  its size N as inputs and returns the average of all the items as a String.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1<=N<=100
1<=Pi<=1000
