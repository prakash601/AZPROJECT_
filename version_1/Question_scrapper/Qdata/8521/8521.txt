You are given an array
a
of
n
integers. You are asked to find out if the inequality
max(ai,ai+1,…,aj−1,aj)≥ai+ai+1+⋯+aj−1+aj
holds for all pairs of indices
(i,j)
, where
1≤i≤j≤n
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤105
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
)  — the size of the array.
The next line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, on a new line output "YES" if the condition is satisfied for the given array, and "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).
Example
input

3
4
-1 1 -1 2
5
-1 2 -3 2 -1
3
2 3 -1
output
Copy
YES
YES
NO
Note
In test cases
1
and
2
, the given condition is satisfied for all
(i,j)
pairs.
In test case
3
, the condition isn't satisfied for the pair
(1,2)
as
max(2,3)<2+3
.
