The chef has cooked
n
dishes yet again: the
i
-th dish consists of
ai
grams of fish and
bi
grams of meat.
Banquet organizers consider two dishes
i
and
j
equal if
ai=aj
and
bi=bj
at the same time.
The banquet organizers estimate the variety of
n
dishes as follows. The variety of a set of dishes is equal to the number of different dishes in it. The less variety is, the better.
In order to reduce the variety, a taster was invited. He will eat exactly
mi
grams of food from each dish. For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and how much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he will eat exactly
mi
grams of the
i
-th dish in total.
Determine how much of what type of food the taster should eat from each dish so that the value of variety is the minimum possible. If there are several correct answers, you may output any of them.
Input
The first line of input data contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next comes a line that contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of dishes. Then follows
n
lines,
i
-th of which contains three integers
ai
,
bi
and
mi
(
0≤ai,bi≤106
;
0≤mi≤ai+bi
) — the mass of fish in
i
-th dish, the mass of meat in
i
-th dish and how many grams in total the taster should eat in
i
-th dish.
The sum of all
n
values for all input data sets in the test does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print on the first line the minimum value of variety that can be achieved by eating exactly
mi
grams of food (for all
i
from
1
to
n
) from a dish
i
.
Then print
n
lines that describe a way to do this: the
i
-th line should contain two integers
xi
and
yi
(
0≤xi≤ai
;
0≤yi≤bi
;
xi+yi=mi
), where
xi
is how many grams of fish the taster should eat from
i
-th dish, and
yi
is how many grams of meat.
If there are several ways to achieve a minimum balance, print any of them.
