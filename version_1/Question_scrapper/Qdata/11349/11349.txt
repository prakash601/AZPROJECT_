You are given an array which is initially empty. You need to perform
n
operations of the given format:
"
a
l
r
k
": append
a
to the end of the array. After that count the number of integer pairs
x,y
such that
l≤x≤y≤r
and
mex(ax,ax+1,…,ay)=k
.
The elements of the array are numerated from
1
in the order they are added to the array.
To make this problem more tricky we don't say your real parameters of the queries. Instead your are given
a′
,
l′
,
r′
,
k′
. To get
a
,
l
,
r
,
k
on the
i
-th operation you need to perform the following:
a:=(a′+lans)mod(n+1)
,
l:=(l′+lans)modi+1
,
r:=(r′+lans)modi+1
,
if
l>r
swap
l
and
r
,
k:=(k′+lans)mod(n+1)
,
where
lans
is the answer to the previous operation, initially
lans
is equal to zero.
i
is the id of the operation, operations are numbered from
1
.
The
mex(S)
, where
S
is a multiset of non-negative integers, is the smallest non-negative integer which does not appear in the set. For example,
mex({2,2,3})=0
and
mex({0,1,4,1,6})=2
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array.
The next
n
lines contain the description of queries.
Each of them
n
lines contains four non-negative integers
a′
,
l′
,
r′
,
k′
(
0,≤a′,l′,r′,k′≤109
), describing one operation.
Output
For each query print a single integer — the answer to this query.

Note
For the first example the decoded values of
a
,
l
,
r
,
k
are the following:
a1=0,l1=1,r1=1,k1=1
a2=1,l2=1,r2=2,k2=0
a3=0,l3=1,r3=3,k3=1
a4=1,l4=1,r4=4,k4=2
a5=2,l5=1,r5=5,k5=3
For the second example the decoded values of
a
,
l
,
r
,
k
are the following:
a1=2,l1=1,r1=1,k1=2
a2=2,l2=1,r2=2,k2=1
a3=0,l3=1,r3=3,k3=0
a4=0,l4=2,r4=2,k4=3
a5=0,l5=3,r5=4,k5=0
