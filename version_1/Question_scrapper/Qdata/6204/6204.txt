Chef gets confused between mean and median very often, and as a result, he has developed a dislike of arrays whose mean and median are not equal.
Chef has an array
A of
N elements. He can perform the following operation on it:
Pick an index
1≤i≤N and increase
A
i
by
1.
He would like to obtain an array whose mean and median are equal. Determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.
Note: The median of an array
A of length
N is defined as follows: Sort the array
A. Then,
If
N is even, the median is the
(
2
N
)
th
element
If
N is odd, the median is the
2
element
For example, the median of the array
[3,4,1,2] is
2 and the median of the array
[3,4,1] is
3.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform to make the mean and median equal.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The mean and median of the array are both
2. They are already equal, so no operations are required.
Test Case
2: It is optimal to apply the operation on
1
st
and
2
nd
index twice each. The array after applying these operations will be
[3,3,3,3], which has both mean and median
3.
