A permutation is an array consisting of
N distinct integers from
1 to
N in arbitrary order.
Chef has two permutation arrays
A and
P of length
N. Chef performs the following three types of operations on the array
A:
1 : Permute the array
A according to the order defined by permutation
P.That is, replace
A with the array
B where
B[P[i]]=A[i].
2 x y : Swap the elements at positions
x and
y in
A.
3 x : Output the element at position
x in array
A.
For each operation of type
3, Chef wants you to output the element at position
x in array
A after all preceding operations have been applied.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N integers denoting elements of array
A.
The third line contains
N integers denoting elements of array
P.
The fourth line contains a single integer
Q, denoting the number of operations to be performed.
Q lines follow, each describing an operation of one of the three types above.
###Output For each test case, for each query of type
3, output the answer in a separate line.
###Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N,Q≤10

1≤A[i],P[i],x,y≤N
A and
P are permutations.

2 operations.
The sum of
N and the sum of
Q over all test cases do not exceed
10

Explanation:
Initially, array
A is
[1,2,3]. It changes as follows:
[1,2,3] ->
[3,1,2] ->
[3,2,1]. So, we output element at position
1 in array
A, which is
3.
