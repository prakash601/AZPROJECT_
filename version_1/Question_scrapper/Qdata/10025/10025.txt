You are given a sequence of
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
.
You have to construct two sequences of integers
b
and
c
with length
n
that satisfy:
for every
i
(
1≤i≤n
)
bi+ci=ai
b
is non-decreasing, which means that for every
1<i≤n
,
bi≥bi−1
must hold
c
is non-increasing, which means that for every
1<i≤n
,
ci≤ci−1
must hold
You have to minimize
max(bi,ci)
. In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences
b
and
c
.
Also there will be
q
changes, the
i
-th change is described by three integers
l,r,x
. You should add
x
to
al,al+1,…,ar
.
You have to find the minimum possible value of
max(bi,ci)
for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The secound line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤i≤n
,
−109≤ai≤109
).
The third line contains an integer
q
(
1≤q≤105
).
Each of the next
q
lines contains three integers
l,r,x
(
1≤l≤r≤n,−109≤x≤109
), desribing the next change.
Output
Print
q+1
lines.
On the
i
-th (
1≤i≤q+1
) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after
i−1
changes.

Note
In the first test:
The initial sequence
a=(2,−1,7,3)
. Two sequences
b=(−3,−3,5,5),c=(5,2,2,−2)
is a possible choice.
After the first change
a=(2,−4,4,0)
. Two sequences
b=(−3,−3,5,5),c=(5,−1,−1,−5)
is a possible choice.
After the second change
a=(2,−4,6,2)
. Two sequences
b=(−4,−4,6,6),c=(6,0,0,−4)
is a possible choice.
