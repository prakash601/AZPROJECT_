Yura is a mathematician, and his cognition of the world is so absolute as if he have been solving formal problems a hundred of trillions of billions of years. This problem is just that!
Consider all non-negative integers from the interval
[0,10n)
. For convenience we complement all numbers with leading zeros in such way that each number from the given interval consists of exactly
n
decimal digits.
You are given a set of pairs
(ui,vi)
, where
ui
and
vi
are distinct decimal digits from
0
to
9
.
Consider a number
x
consisting of
n
digits. We will enumerate all digits from left to right and denote them as
d1,d2,…,dn
. In one operation you can swap digits
di
and
di+1
if and only if there is a pair
(uj,vj)
in the set such that at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
di=uj
and
di+1=vj
,
di=vj
and
di+1=uj
.
We will call the numbers
x
and
y
, consisting of
n
digits, equivalent if the number
x
can be transformed into the number
y
using some number of operations described above. In particular, every number is considered equivalent to itself.
You are given an integer
n
and a set of
m
pairs of digits
(ui,vi)
. You have to find the maximum integer
k
such that there exists a set of integers
x1,x2,…,xk
(
0≤xi<10n
) such that for each
1≤i<j≤k
the number
xi
is not equivalent to the number
xj
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤50000
) — the number of digits in considered numbers.
The second line contains an integer
m
(
0≤m≤45
) — the number of pairs of digits in the set.
Each of the following
m
lines contains two digits
ui
and
vi
, separated with a space (
0≤ui<vi≤9
).
It's guaranteed that all described pairs are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print one integer — the maximum value
k
such that there exists a set of integers
x1,x2,…,xk
(
0≤xi<10n
) such that for each
1≤i<j≤k
the number
xi
is not equivalent to the number
xj
.
As the answer can be big enough, print the number
k
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example we can construct a set that contains all integers from
0
to
9
. It's easy to see that there are no two equivalent numbers in the set.
In the second example there exists a unique pair of equivalent numbers:
01
and
10
. We can construct a set that contains all integers from
0
to
99
despite number
1
.
