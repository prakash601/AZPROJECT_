Chef has a sorted array
A of size
N consisting of
distinct elements which you
don’t know. You will be provided with an integer
X. You have to check whether
X exists in Chef's array or not. If it exists, find out at which index it exists. You can ask just
one type of query as follows
:-
You can ask at-most
q such queries. If you ask a question for an index say
m, then Chef returns the sum of
K elements of his array starting from index
m, where
K =
2
i
and
i is the maximum value of
integer such that
m is perfectly divisible by
K.
For Example, if
m=13 then
K is
1, if
m=8 then
K is
8, if
m=12 then
K is
4. So, if say
m is 12, i.e.
K is 4, Chef will return sum of A[12] + A[13] + A[14] + A[15].
- If you will ask for index greater than
then Chef will return
.
NOTE - As for any query Chef will return sum of array elements from
m to
m+K−1. So if
m+K−1 gets larger than
N then Chef will return sum upto last element of the array.
For eg :  If size of array is 26 and
K for
m = 16 is
16, so
m+K−1 is
31. Chef will return sum of A[16 : 26].
###Interaction:
First, you should read a line containing a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for
T test cases follows-
For every test case, you have to read two space separated integers
N and X, for
subtask 2, N is unknown so when
N is -1 consider you don't know
N.
For each test case, you should start by asking questions as follows- - To ask a question, print a line containing two space separated integer
1 and
m.
 - Then, you must read a line containing a single integer.
When you think you know index of
X in Chef's array, print a line containing two space separated integers
2 and index of
X.
If
X is not present in Chef's array, print a line containing two space separated integers
2 and
−1.
Then, you must read a line containing a single string
Yes or
No. If this string is
Yes, you should continue solving the remaining test cases, otherwise your answer was incorrect and you should immediately terminate your program to receive the
Wrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
