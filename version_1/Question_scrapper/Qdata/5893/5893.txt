A string
S whose characters are one of the following 5:
(,
),
+,
− and
?, is said to be a valid string if one of the following conditions holds:
S= ?
S=(x+y), where
x and
y are valid strings.
S=(x−y), where
x and
y are valid strings.
For example, strings
?,
(?−?),
(?+(?−?)) are valid strings, while strings
(?−+),
??,
(?),
?−?,
(?+?)) are not.
The power of a valid string
S is defined to be the maximum value attainable by replacing each
? in it by either
0 or
1 and evaluating the resulting expression.
For example, the power of
(?−?) is
1 because we can obtain
(1−0) which evaluates to
1.
You are given a valid string
S, and
Q queries on it. Each query is represented by two integers
L and
R (
L≤R). Your task is to find the power of the substring
S
L
,S
L+1
,…,S
R
. It is guaranteed that this substring is a valid string.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows:
The first line of each test case contains the string
S.
The next line contains an integer
Q, representing the number of queries to answer.
Each of the following
Q lines contains two space-separated integers,
L and
R, representing the query.
Output Format
For each test case, print one line containing
Q space-separated integers, the
i-th of which represents the answer to the
i-th query.

Explanation:
Test case 1:
Query 1: Power of the string
? is
1, as it can be converted to
1.
Query 2: Power of the string
(?+?) is
2, as it can be converted to
(1+1).
Test case 2:
Query 1: Power of the string
(?−(?−?)) is
2, as it can be converted to
(1−(0−1)).
Query 2: Power of the string
(?−?) is
1, as it can be converted to
(1−0).
Test case 3:
Query 1: Power of the string
(?−(?+?)) is
1, as it can be converted to
(1−(0+0)).
