Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef needs at least
8 boxes such that no box has two balls of same colour. A possible configuration of the
8 boxes would be
{[1,2],[1,2],[1,2],[1,2],[1,2],[1],[1],[1]} where the
i
th
element of this set denotes the colour of balls in the
i
th
box.
Test case
2: Chef needs at least
15 boxes such that no box has two balls of same colour.
Test case
3: Chef needs at least
4 boxes such that no box has two balls of same colour. A possible configuration of the
4 boxes would be
{[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]} where the
i
th
element of this set denotes the colour of balls in the
i
th
box.
