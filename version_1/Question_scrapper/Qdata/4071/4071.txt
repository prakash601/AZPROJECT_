Ved started playing a new mobile game called Fighting Clans. An army of
N enemies is approaching his base. The
i
th
enemy has
H
i
health points. An enemy gets killed if his health points become
0.
Ved defends his base using a weapon named Inferno. He can set the Inferno to one of the following two modes:
Single-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target exactly one living enemy and cause damage of at most
X health points.
Multi-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target all living enemies and cause damage of
1 health point to each of them.
Find the minimum time required to kill all the enemies.
Note: Ved is not allowed to change the mode of the weapon once it is set initially.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
X - the number of enemies and the damage caused by the single-target mode of Inferno in one second respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case 1: In single-target mode, all enemies can be killed in
1 second each. Thus, in single-target mode, the total time required is
5 seconds.
In multi-target mode:
After one second, the health points of the enemies are:
[1,1,3,0,0]. Enemies
4 and
5 are dead after one second.
After two seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[0,0,2,0,0].
After three seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[0,0,1,0,0].
After four seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[0,0,0,0,0].
Thus,
4 seconds are required to kill enemies using multi-target mode. The minimum time required to kill all the enemies is
4 seconds.
Test case 2: In single-target mode, all enemies can be killed in
1 second each. Thus, in single-target mode, the total time required is
3 seconds.
In multi-target mode:
After one second, the health points of the enemies are:
[4,3,4].
After two seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[3,2,3].
After three seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[2,1,2].
After four seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[1,0,1].
After five seconds, the health points of the enemies are:
[0,0,0].
Thus,
5 seconds are required to kill enemies using multi-target mode. The minimum time required to kill all the enemies is
3 seconds.
Test case 3: Here, single-target mode will take
4 seconds and multi-target mode will also take
4 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time required is
4 seconds.
Test case 4: Here, single-target mode will take
3 seconds, while multi-target mode will take
9 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time required is
3 seconds.
