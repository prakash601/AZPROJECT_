You are given
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
. Is it possible to arrange them on a circle so that each number is strictly greater than both its neighbors or strictly smaller than both its neighbors?
In other words, check if there exists a rearrangement
b1,b2,…,bn
of the integers
a1,a2,…,an
such that for each
i
from
1
to
n
at least one of the following conditions holds:
bi−1<bi>bi+1
bi−1>bi<bi+1
To make sense of the previous formulas for
i=1
and
i=n
, one shall define
b0=bn
and
bn+1=b1
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤3⋅104
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤105
)  — the number of integers.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, if it is not possible to arrange the numbers on the circle satisfying the conditions from the statement, output
NO
. You can output each letter in any case.
Otherwise, output
YES
. In the second line, output
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
, which are a rearrangement of
a1,a2,…,an
and satisfy the conditions from the statement. If there are multiple valid ways to arrange the numbers, you can output any of them.

Note
It can be shown that there are no valid arrangements for the first and the third test cases.
In the second test case, the arrangement
[1,8,4,9]
works. In this arrangement,
1
and
4
are both smaller than their neighbors, and
8,9
are larger.
In the fourth test case, the arrangement
[1,11,1,111,1,1111]
works. In this arrangement, the three elements equal to
1
are smaller than their neighbors, while all other elements are larger than their neighbors.
