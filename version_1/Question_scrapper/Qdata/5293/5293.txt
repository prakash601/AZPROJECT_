Appy loves balloons! She wants you to give her balloons on each of
N consecutive days (numbered
1 through
N); let's denote the number of balloons Appy wants on day
i by
A
i
. The problem is that you only have
M balloons. Fortunately, you can give her candies instead of balloons as well. On each day
i, Appy accepts
B
i
candies per each balloon you do not give her — formally, if you give Appy
X
i
balloons on day
i, then you have to give her
C
i
=max(0,A
i
−X
i
)⋅B
i
candies as well.
Your task is to minimize the maximum number of candies you give Appy on some day — find the minimum possible value of
max(C

Explanation:
If you give Appy
0,0,0,1,2 balloons on days
1 through
5, then the required numbers of candies on each day are
1,4,9,12,15. The maximum number of candies is
15, required on day
5.
