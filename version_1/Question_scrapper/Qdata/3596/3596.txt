Explanation:
Test case
1: The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is
90. The new selling price is
10% more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is
110−90=20.
Test case
2: The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is
195. The new selling price is
10% more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is
220−195=25.
Test case
3: The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is
490. The new selling price is
10% more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is
550−490=60.
Test case
4: The buying price of the item is the difference of selling price and profit, which is
93. The new selling price is
10% more than the initial selling price. Thus, the new profit is
110−93=17.
