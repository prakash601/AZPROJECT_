Li Hua has a tree of
n
vertices and
n−1
edges. The root of the tree is vertex
1
. Each vertex
i
has importance
ai
. Denote the size of a subtree as the number of vertices in it, and the importance as the sum of the importance of vertices in it. Denote the heavy son of a non-leaf vertex as the son with the largest subtree size. If multiple of them exist, the heavy son is the one with the minimum index.
Li Hua wants to perform
m
operations:
"1
x
" (
1≤x≤n
) — calculate the importance of the subtree whose root is
x
.
"2
x
" (
2≤x≤n
) — rotate the heavy son of
x
up. Formally, denote
sonx
as the heavy son of
x
,
fax
as the father of
x
. He wants to remove the edge between
x
and
fax
and connect an edge between
sonx
and
fax
. It is guaranteed that
x
is not root, but not guaranteed that
x
is not a leaf. If
x
is a leaf, please ignore the operation.
Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.
Input
The first line contains 2 integers
n,m
(
2≤n≤105,1≤m≤105
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of operations.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
) — the importance of each vertex.
Next
n−1
lines contain the edges of the tree. The
i
-th line contains two integers
ui
and
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
,
ui≠vi
) — the corresponding edge. The given edges form a tree.
Next
m
lines contain operations — one operation per line. The
j
-th operation contains two integers
tj,xj
(
tj∈{1,2}
,
1≤xj≤n
,
xj≠1
if
tj=2
) — the
j
-th operation.
Output
For each query "1
x
", output the answer in an independent line.

Note
In the first example:
The initial tree is shown in the following picture:
The importance of the subtree of
6
is
a6+a7=2
.
After rotating the heavy son of
3
(which is
6
) up, the tree is shown in the following picture:
The importance of the subtree of
6
is
a6+a3+a7=3
.
The importance of the subtree of
2
is
a2+a4+a5=3
.
