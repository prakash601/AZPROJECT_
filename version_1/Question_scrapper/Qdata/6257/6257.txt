One day, Tanya was studying graph theory. She is very inquisitive, so the following problem soon came to her mind.
Find the number of undirected unweighted connected simple graphs with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and
M edges, such that for each
i (
2≤i≤N), the shortest path from vertex
1 to vertex
i is unique and its length is equal to
A
i
. In other words, for each
i (
2≤i≤N), there should be exactly one path with length
A
i
between vertices
1 and
i, and there should be no paths with smaller length between these vertices.
Two graphs with
N vertices are distinct if we can find two vertices
u and
v such that there is an edge between these vertices in one graph, but not in the other graph.
Since the answer could be very large, compute it modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10

+7).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
A

,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of graphs modulo
10
9
+7.
