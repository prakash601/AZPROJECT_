You are given an integer
n
. Find a sequence of
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
such that
1≤ai≤109
for all
i
and
a1⊕a2⊕⋯⊕an=
a1+a2+⋯+an
n
,
where
⊕
represents the bitwise XOR.
It can be proven that there exists a sequence of integers that satisfies all the conditions above.
Input
The first line of input contains
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the sequence you have to find.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, output
n
space-separated integers
a1,a2,…,an
satisfying the conditions in the statement.
If there are several possible answers, you can output any of them.
Example
input
Copy
3
1
4
3
output
Copy
69
13 2 8 1
7 7 7
Note
In the first test case,
69=
69
1
=69
.
In the second test case,
13⊕2⊕8⊕1=
13+2+8+1
4
=6
.
