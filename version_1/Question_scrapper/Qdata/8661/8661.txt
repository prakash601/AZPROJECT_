You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
positive integers, and an array
b
, with length
n
. Initially
bi=0
for each
1≤i≤n
.
In one move you can choose an integer
i
(
1≤i≤n
), and add
ai
to
bi
or subtract
ai
from
bi
. What is the minimum number of moves needed to make
b
increasing (that is, every element is strictly greater than every element before it)?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤5000
).
The second line contains
n
integers,
a1
,
a2
, ...,
an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
Print a single integer, the minimum number of moves to make
b
increasing.

Note
Example
1
: you can subtract
a1
from
b1
, and add
a3
,
a4
, and
a5
to
b3
,
b4
, and
b5
respectively. The final array will be [
−1
,
0
,
3
,
4
,
5
] after
4
moves.
Example
2
: you can reach [

] in
10
moves.
