You are given a binary string
S. Chef defines
MEX(S) as the smallest non-negative integer such that its binary representation (without leading '0'-s; in particular, the binary representation of
0 is "0") is not a subsequence of
S.
Chef is asking you to find
MEX(S). Since this integer could be very large, find its binary representation (without leading '0'-s).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string
S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string:
MEX(S) in binary representation.

Explanation:
Example case 1: All integers between
0 and
11 inclusive, in binary representation, appear in
S as subsequences. However, the binary representation of
12 (which is "1100") is not a subsequence of
S.
Example case 2: Since
S contains only '1'-s, the string "0" is not a subsequence of
S and therefore
MEX(S)=0.
