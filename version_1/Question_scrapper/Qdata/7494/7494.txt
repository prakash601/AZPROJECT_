Chef has a binary string
S of length
N.
He can perform the following operation on string
S:
Select a substring of size
M and flip all the characters of the selected substring, i.e., change
0 to
1 and
1 to
0.
There are
Q queries of the following
2 types:
0: Append
0 to the front of string
S.
1: Append
1 to the front of string
S.
After each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make lexicographically smallest possible string from
S. Note that queries are dependent. Thus, after each query, the string
S gets updated.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
N,
M, and
Q.
The second line of each test case contains the string
S.
After that,
Q lines follow. The
i
th
line contains an integer
X
(0≤X≤1) - the
i
th
query. For each query, you need to append
X to the front of string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, print
Q lines. The
i
th
line should contain the answer to the
i
th
query.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: Initially,
S=10011.
After the first query,
S becomes
110011. The lexicographically minimum string into which
S can be converted is
000000. The string
110011 can be converted to
000000 using
2 operations:
Operation
1: Select the subarray
[1,2] and flip it. Now,
S becomes
000011.
Operation
2: Select the subarray
[5,6] and flip it. Now,
S becomes
000000.
It can be proven that
110011 cannot be converted into
000000 in less than
2 operations.
After the second query,
S becomes
0110011. The lexicographically minimum string into which
S can be converted is
0000000. The string
0110011 can be converted to
0000000 using
2 operations:
Operation
1: Select the subarray
[2,3] and flip it. Now,
S becomes
0000011.
Operation
2: Select the subarray
[6,7] and flip it. Now,
S becomes
0000000.
It can be proven that
0110011 cannot be converted into
0000000 in less than
2 operations.
After the third query,
S becomes
10110011. The lexicographically minimum string into which
S can be converted is
00000001. The string
10110011 can be converted to
00000001 using
5 operations: These operations are
[1,2],
[2,3],
[4,5],
[5,6], and
[6,7] in the given order.
It can be proven that
S cannot be converted into a lexicographically smaller string than
00000001 using any number of operations.
Also, it can be proven that
10110011 cannot be converted into
00000001 in less than
5 operations.
