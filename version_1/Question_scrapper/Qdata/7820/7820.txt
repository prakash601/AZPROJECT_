You are given a room that can be represented by a
n×m
grid. There is a ball at position
(i1,j1)
(the intersection of row
i1
and column
j1
), and it starts going diagonally in one of the four directions:
The ball is going down and right, denoted by
DR
; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from
(i,j)
to
(i+1,j+1)
.
The ball is going down and left, denoted by
DL
; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from
(i,j)
to
(i+1,j−1)
.
The ball is going up and right, denoted by
UR
; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from
(i,j)
to
(i−1,j+1)
.
The ball is going up and left, denoted by
UL
; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from
(i,j)
to
(i−1,j−1)
.
After each step, the ball maintains its direction unless it hits a wall (that is, the direction takes it out of the room's bounds in the next step). In this case, the ball's direction gets flipped along the axis of the wall; if the ball hits a corner, both directions get flipped. Any instance of this is called a bounce. The ball never stops moving.
In the above example, the ball starts at
(1,7)
and goes
DL
until it reaches the bottom wall, then it bounces and continues in the direction
UL
. After reaching the left wall, the ball bounces and continues to go in the direction
UR
. When the ball reaches the upper wall, it bounces and continues in the direction
DR
. After reaching the bottom-right corner, it bounces once and continues in direction
UL
, and so on.
Your task is to find how many bounces the ball will go through until it reaches cell
(i2,j2)
in the room, or report that it never reaches cell
(i2,j2)
by printing
−1
.
Note that the ball first goes in a cell and only after that bounces if it needs to.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains six integers and a string
n,m,i1,j1,i2,j2,d
(
2≤n,m≤25000
;
1≤i1,i2≤n
;
1≤j1,j2≤m
;
d∈{DR,DL,UR,UL}
) — the dimensions of the grid, the starting coordinates of the ball, the coordinates of the final cell and the starting direction of the ball.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n⋅m
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅104
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of bounces the ball does until it reaches cell
(i2,j2)
for the first time, or
−1
if the ball never reaches the final cell.
