You are given an array of positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
.
Make the product of all the numbers in the array (that is,
a1⋅a2⋅…⋅an
) divisible by
2n
.
You can perform the following operation as many times as you like:
select an arbitrary index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and replace the value
ai
with
ai=ai⋅i
.
You cannot apply the operation repeatedly to a single index. In other words, all selected values of
i
must be different.
Find the smallest number of operations you need to perform to make the product of all the elements in the array divisible by
2n
. Note that such a set of operations does not always exist.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤104
) — the number test cases.
Then the descriptions of the input data sets follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains exactly
n
integers:
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
values over all test cases in a test does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print the least number of operations to make the product of all numbers in the array divisible by
2n
. If the answer does not exist, print -1.

Note
In the first test case, the product of all elements is initially
2
, so no operations needed.
In the second test case, the product of elements initially equals
6
. We can apply the operation for
i=2
, and then
a2
becomes
2⋅2=4
, and the product of numbers becomes
3⋅4=12
, and this product of numbers is divided by
2n=22=4
.
In the fourth test case, even if we apply all possible operations, we still cannot make the product of numbers divisible by
2n
 — it will be
(13⋅1)⋅(17⋅2)⋅(1⋅3)⋅(1⋅4)=5304
, which does not divide by
2n=24=16
.
In the fifth test case, we can apply operations for
i=2
and
i=4
.
