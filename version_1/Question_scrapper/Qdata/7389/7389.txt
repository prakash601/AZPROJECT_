Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random arrays as birthday presents, but this time she received an array as a present for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with this array, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her this problem.
You are given an array
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] containing
N distinct integers. Count the number of ways to form (unordered) sets of disjoint increasing subsequences of
A.
Formally, count the number of sets
S={S
1
,S
2
,…,S
k
} such that:
Each
S
i
is an increasing subsequence of
A.
If
i

=j,
S
i
and
S
j
are disjoint, i.e,
i

=j⟹S
i
∩S
j
=∅
Note that it is not necessary that the sequences
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
k
form a partition of
A - in other words, some elements of
A may not be in any chosen subsequence.
Two sets are considered equal if they contain the same subsequences. For example, the sets
{[1,2],[3]} and
{[3],[1,2]} are considered to be the same and should only be counted once.
Note that the final answer can be rather large, so compute its remainder after dividing it by
10
9
+7.
Please refer to the sample for a few examples.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N - the size of
A.
The second line contains
N distinct space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
- the elements of
A.
Output Format
For each test, print one line containing a single integer, the answer to the problem modulo
(10
9
+7).
Constraints
1≤T≤2000
1≤N≤20
1≤A

≤N
The elements of
A are distinct.
Each input file contains at most
3 tests with
N>10.

Explanation:
Test case 1: All possible sets are
{},{[1]},{[2]},{[1],[2]},{[1,2]}. Note that the empty set is also counted; and it is not necessary to use every element of
A in some increasing subsequence.
Test case 2: Some of the valid possible ways are:
S={[1,2,7],[3,6],[4]}.
S={[1,2,6],[7],[3],[4]}
S={[1,2,6],[7],[3,5],[4]}
S={[1,2,6],[7],[3,4]}
S={[1,4],[2,3],[6],[7]}
Once again, note that we count unordered sets. So, the following sets are considered the same:
{[1,4],[2,3],[6],[7]} or
{[6],[1,4],[2,3],[7]} or
{[1,4],[6],[2,3],[7]} or
{[7],[2,3],[6],[1,4]}
