You are given a deck of
n
cards numbered from
1
to
n
(not necessarily in this order in the deck). You have to sort the deck by repeating the following operation.
Choose
2≤k≤n
and split the deck in
k
nonempty contiguous parts
D1,D2,…,Dk
(
D1
contains the first
|D1|
cards of the deck,
D2
contains the following
|D2|
cards and so on). Then reverse the order of the parts, transforming the deck into
Dk,Dk−1,…,D2,D1
(so, the first
|Dk|
cards of the new deck are
Dk
, the following
|Dk−1|
cards are
Dk−1
and so on). The internal order of each packet of cards
Di
is unchanged by the operation.
You have to obtain a sorted deck (i.e., a deck where the first card is
1
, the second is
2
and so on) performing at most
n
operations. It can be proven that it is always possible to sort the deck performing at most
n
operations.
Examples of operation: The following are three examples of valid operations (on three decks with different sizes).
If the deck is [3 6 2 1 4 5 7] (so
3
is the first card and
7
is the last card), we may apply the operation with
k=4
and
D1=
[3 6],
D2=
[2 1 4],
D3=
[5],
D4=
[7]. Doing so, the deck becomes [7 5 2 1 4 3 6].
If the deck is [3 1 2], we may apply the operation with
k=3
and
D1=
[3],
D2=
[1],
D3=
[2]. Doing so, the deck becomes [2 1 3].
If the deck is [5 1 2 4 3 6], we may apply the operation with
k=2
and
D1=
[5 1],
D2=
[2 4 3 6]. Doing so, the deck becomes [2 4 3 6 5 1].
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤52
)  — the number of cards in the deck.
The second line contains
n
integers
c1,c2,…,cn
 — the cards in the deck. The first card is
c1
, the second is
c2
and so on.
It is guaranteed that for all
i=1,…,n
there is exactly one
j∈{1,…,n}
such that
cj=i
.
Output
On the first line, print the number
q
of operations you perform (it must hold
0≤q≤n
).
Then, print
q
lines, each describing one operation.
To describe an operation, print on a single line the number
k
of parts you are going to split the deck in, followed by the size of the
k
parts:
|D1|,|D2|,…,|Dk|
.
It must hold
2≤k≤n
, and
|Di|≥1
for all
i=1,…,k
, and
|D1|+|D2|+⋯+|Dk|=n
.
It can be proven that it is always possible to sort the deck performing at most
n
operations. If there are several ways to sort the deck you can output any of them.

Note
Explanation of the first testcase: Initially the deck is [3 1 2 4].
The first operation splits the deck as [(3) (1 2) (4)] and then transforms it into [4 1 2 3].
The second operation splits the deck as [(4) (1 2 3)] and then transforms it into [1 2 3 4].
Explanation of the second testcase: Initially the deck is [6 5 4 3 2 1].
The first (and only) operation splits the deck as [(6) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1)] and then transforms it into [1 2 3 4 5 6].
