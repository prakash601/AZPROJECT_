Find
K distinct numbers in the range
[1,N] such that the bitwise XOR of all the numbers is maximized. Print any set of these numbers that maximize the XOR.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers
N,
K.
###Output For each test case, output
K distinct integers in any order as described in the problem.

###Explanation Test Case
1: The only possible set is
{10} which gives the value
10.
Test Case
2: The other possible set is
{9,6} which gives the value
9⊕6=15=7⊕8.
Test Case
3: The only possible set is
{1,2,3,4,5,6,8} which gives the value
1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5⊕6⊕8=15.
