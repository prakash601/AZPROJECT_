Given a binary string S. The task is to count the number of substrings that starts and end with 1.
Note: The starting and the ending 1s should be different.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "10101"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 substrings are "101",
"10101" and "101".
â€‹Example 2:
Input: 
S = "100"
Output: 0
Explanation: No substring that starts and
ends with 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countSubstr() which takes the string S as input and returns the count of the substrings that start and end with 1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 1000
