You are given a string
S. Let the set of strings
ST be the set of all distinct contiguous palindromic substrings of
S. Each element of
ST has a value associated with it which is initially 0. You need to process
Q queries which are of the following two types:
1
L
R
P
X: Add
X to the values of all palindromes that are substrings of
S[1...P] and are of the form
T+S[L...R]+rev(T) where
rev(T) denotes the reverse of
T. Here
T can be any string (possibly empty). It is guaranteed that
S[L...R] is a palindrome.
2
L
R: Print the value of
S[L..R]. It is guaranteed that
S[L...R] is a palindrome.
Input Format
The first line of input contains the string
S.
The second line contains an integer
Q - number of queries.
Next
Q lines contain description of queries. Each line starts from integer
type (
1≤type≤2) - the type of the query.
If
type=1, then rest of the line contains integers
L,R,P,X.
If
type=2, then rest of the line contains integers
L,R.
Output Format
For each query of the second type, output the answer to it.

Explanation:
Initially, the set
ST={a,b,c,bb,cc,ccc,abba}. Initially, the value associated with all of them is
0.
Query
1:
S[1...4]=abba. There does not exist any substring in
S[1...3] of the form
T+abba+rev(T). So no value is changed.
Query
2: Value of
S[1...4]=abba is
0.
Query
3:
S[1...4]=abba. The substrings in
S[1...4] of the form
T+abba+rev(T) are:
abba. So value of
abba increases from
0 to
228.
Query
4: Value of
S[1...4]=abba is
228.
Query
5:
S[2...3]=bb. The substrings in
S[1...3] of the form
T+bb+rev(T) are:
bb. So value of
bb increases from
0 to
322.
Query
6: Value of
S[2...3]=bb is
322.
Query
7: Value of
S[1...4]=abba is
228.
Query
8:
S[5...5]=c. The substrings in
S[1...6] of the form
T+c+rev(T) are:
c. So value of
c increases from
0 to
1337.
Query
9: Value of
S[5...6]=cc is
0.
