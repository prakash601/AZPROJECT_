For the first time, Polycarp's startup ended the year with a profit! Now he is about to distribute
k
burles as a bonus among
n
employees.
It is known that the current salary of the
i
-th employee is
ai
and all the values of
ai
in the company are different.
Polycarp wants to distribute the
k
burles between
n
employees so this month the
i
-th employee will be paid not
ai
, but
ai+di
(
di≥0
,
di
is an integer), where
di
is the bonus for the
i
-th employee. Of course,
d1+d2+⋯+dn=k
.
Polycarp will follow two rules for choosing the values
di
:
the relative order of the salaries should not be changed: the employee with originally the highest salary (
ai
is the maximum) should have the highest total payment after receiving their bonus (
ai+di
is also the maximum), the employee whose salary was originally the second-largest should receive the second-largest total payment after receiving their bonus and so on.
to emphasize that annual profit is a group effort, Polycarp wants to minimize the maximum total payment to an employee (i.e minimize the maximum value of
ai+di
).
Help Polycarp decide the non-negative integer bonuses
di
such that:
their sum is
k
,
for each employee, the number of those who receive strictly more than them remains unchanged (that is, if you sort employees by
ai
and by
ai+di
, you get the same order of employees),
all
ai+di
are different,
the maximum of the values
ai+di
is the minimum possible.
Help Polycarp and print any of the possible answers
d1,d2,…,dn
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤105
,
1≤k≤109
) — the number of employees and the total bonus.
The second line of each test case contains
n
different integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
), where
ai
is the current salary of the
i
-th employee.
It is guaranteed that the sum of all
n
values in the input does not exceed
105
.
Output
Print the answers to
t
test cases in the order they appear in the input. Print each answer as a sequence of non-negative integers
d1,d2,…,dn
. If there are several answers, print any of them.
