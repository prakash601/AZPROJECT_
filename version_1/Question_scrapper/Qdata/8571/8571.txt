You are given two arrays
a
and
b
, both consisting of
n
integers.
In one move, you can choose two indices
i
and
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
;
i≠j
) and swap
ai
with
aj
and
bi
with
bj
. You have to perform the swap in both arrays.
You are allowed to perform at most
104
moves (possibly, zero). Can you make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order at the end? If you can, print any sequence of moves that makes both arrays sorted.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
) — the number of elements in both arrays.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — the first array.
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤n
) — the second array.
Output
For each testcase, print the answer. If it's impossible to make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order in at most
104
moves, print -1. Otherwise, first, print the number of moves
k
(0≤k≤104)
. Then print
i
and
j
for each move
(1≤i,j≤n
;
i≠j)
.
If there are multiple answers, then print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of moves.
