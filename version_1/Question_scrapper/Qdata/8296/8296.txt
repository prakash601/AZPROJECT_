You have two strings
s1
and
s2
of length
n
, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
Choose a positive integer
1≤k≤n
.
Swap the prefix of the string
s1
and the suffix of the string
s2
of length
k
.
Is it possible to make these two strings equal by doing described operations?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of three lines.
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the strings
s1
and
s2
.
The second line contains the string
s1
of length
n
, consisting of lowercase English letters.
The third line contains the string
s2
of length
n
, consisting of lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make the strings equal, and "NO" otherwise.

Note
In the first test case:
Initially
s1=cbc
,
s2=aba
.
Operation with
k=1
, after the operation
s1=abc
,
s2=abc
.
In the second test case:
Initially
s1=abcaa
,
s2=cbabb
.
Operation with
k=2
, after the operation
s1=bbcaa
,
s2=cbaab
.
Operation with
k=3
, after the operation
s1=aabaa
,
s2=cbbbc
.
Operation with
k=1
, after the operation
s1=cabaa
,
s2=cbbba
.
Operation with
k=2
, after the operation
s1=babaa
,
s2=cbbca
.
Operation with
k=1
, after the operation
s1=aabaa
,
s2=cbbcb
.
Operation with
k=2
, after the operation
s1=cbbaa
,
s2=cbbaa
.
In the third test case, it's impossible to make strings equal.
