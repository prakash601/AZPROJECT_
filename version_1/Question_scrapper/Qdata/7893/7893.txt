You are given a simple undirected graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges. The vertices are numbered from
1
to
n
. The
i
-th vertex has a value
ai
written on it.
You will be removing vertices from that graph. You are allowed to remove vertex
i
only if its degree is equal to
ai
. When a vertex is removed, all edges incident to it are also removed, thus, decreasing the degree of adjacent non-removed vertices.
A valid sequence of removals is a permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
(1≤pi≤n)
such that the
i
-th vertex to be removed is
pi
, and every removal is allowed.
A pair
(x,y)
of vertices is nice if there exist two valid sequences of removals such that
x
is removed before
y
in one of them and
y
is removed before
x
in the other one.
Count the number of nice pairs
(x,y)
such that
x<y
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤105
;
0≤m≤min(105,
n⋅(n−1)
2
)
) — the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤n−1
) — the degree requirements for each removal.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
v
and
u
(
1≤v,u≤n
;
v≠u
) — the description of an edge.
The graph doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
105
. The sum of
m
over all testcases doesn't exceed
105
.
Additional constraint on the input: there always exists at least one valid sequence of removals.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of nice pairs of vertices.
