Gritukan likes to take cyclic trips around the world. There are
N countries numbered
1 through
N in the world. Before starting his travels, Gritukan chooses a permutation
P of all
N countries. Then, he visits all countries (some countries may be visited multiple times) using the following algorithm:
for each
v from
1 to
N inclusive:
travel to country
v
travel from country
v to country
P
v
, then from country
P
v
to country
P
P
v
, and so on until he reaches country
v again; let's call this sequence of visited countries a cyclic route
(Each country appears at most once in a cyclic route. It is also possible for a route to contain only one country if
v=P
v
, in which case Gritukan's travel along this route consists of staying in country
v.)
Unfortunately, Gritukan does not remember the routes he took. He only remembers a sequence
A
1..N
with the following meaning: for each country
v, the number of cyclic routes which contained this country is
A
v
. Given the sequence
A, Gritukan asks you to calculate the number of permutations
P consistent with this sequence, modulo
998244353 (it's prime).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible permutations modulo
998244353 (it's prime).
