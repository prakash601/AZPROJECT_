For her birthday, Rima got an integer sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Each element of this sequence is either 1 or 2.
Let's call an integer
s (
1≤s≤2N) a summary integer if there is a contiguous subsequence of
A such that the sum of its elements is equal to
s.
Rima wants to count all the summary integers. Can you help her?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of summary integers.
