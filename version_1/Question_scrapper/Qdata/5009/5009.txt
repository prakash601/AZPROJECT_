You may have solved a lot of problems related to XOR and we are sure that you liked them, so here is one more problem for you.
You are given a binary string
S of length
N. Let string
T be the result of taking the XOR of all substrings of size
K of
S. You need to find the number of 1 bits in
T.
Note:
A substring is a continuous part of string which can be obtained by deleting some (may be none) character's from the beginning and some (may be none) character's from the end.
XOR of many similar-sized strings is defined here.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer
T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S of size
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line number of 1 bits in the XOR of all substrings of size
K of
S.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤K≤N≤2⋅10

∣S∣=N
S only contains characters 0 and 1.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All
1-sized substrings of
S are:
0
1
1
0
The XOR of these strings is 0, therefore the number of 1 bits is
0.
Test case
2: All
2-sized substrings of
S are:
10
00
01
The XOR of these strings is 11, therefore the number of 1 bits is
2.
Test case
3: All
3-sized substrings of
S are:
111
111
The XOR of these strings is 000, therefore the number of 1 bits is
0.
Test case
4: All
4-sized substrings of
S are:
0110
The XOR of these strings is 0110, therefore the number of 1 bits is
2.
