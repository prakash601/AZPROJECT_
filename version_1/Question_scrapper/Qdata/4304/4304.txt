respectively. A problem set comprises at least two problems and no two problems in a problem set should have the same difficulty level. A problem can belong to at most one problem set. Find the maximum number of problem sets you can create using the four problems.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: You can prepare the first problem set using the first two problems and the second problem set using the next two problems. So the problem sets will be
[1,4] and
[3,2].
Test case
2: You can prepare one problem set using one problem having a difficulty level of
4 and the other having a difficulty level of
5. There is no way to prepare more than one problem set.
Test case
3: There is no way to prepare a problem set.
