You are given two numbers
N and
M. A pair of arrays
(A,B) is called
K-beautiful if and only if:
∣A∣=∣B∣=N (i.e. both their lengths are equal to
N)
For all
i such that
1≤i≤N,
0≤A
i
≤M and
0≤B
i
≤M.
mex(A)≤mex(B)
A is lexicographically smaller than
B
The first index
i where
A
i
<B
i
is
K
For each
K (
1≤K≤N), find the number of
K-beautiful pairs and print those values modulo
MOD.
Note: An array
X is lexicographically smaller than
Y if an only if there exists some
i such that
X
i
<Y
i
and
X
j
=Y
j
for
1≤j<i. Also,
mex(X) denotes the minimum non-negative integer that does not occur in
X
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains three integers
N,
M,
MOD - the parameters defined in the statement.
Output Format
Output
N integers such that the
i-th value denotes the number of
i-beautiful pairs modulo
MOD.

Explanation:
All the arrays of length
2 with values in range
[0,1] are :
[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]. These arrays can form the following beautiful pairs:
1-beautiful :
([0,1],[1,0]),([0,0],[1,0])
2-beautiful :
([0,1],[0,0])
Thus, we should print
[2 mod 204789219,
1 mod 204789219] =
[2,1]
