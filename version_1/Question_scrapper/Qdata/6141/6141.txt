Archi is a small boy from Uzhlyandia. For Chef's birthday, he prepared a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N). Each edge in this tree has a certain length.
There are
M speedsters on the tree, numbered
1 through
M. For each valid
i, speedster number
i starts at time
t
i
from vertex number
u
i
and runs straight to vertex number
v
i
with constant velocity
s
i
. Before time
t
i
, the speedster is not considered to be present in the tree.
Chef is interested in the following question: for each vertex, what is the smallest time when a speedster is present at this vertex?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers
u,
v and
w denoting an edge between vertices
u and
v with length
w.
The next line contains a single integer
M.
For each valid
i, the
i-th of the next
M lines contains four space-separated integers
u
i
,
v
i
,
t
i
and
s
i
describing the
i-th speedster.
Output
For each test case, print
N lines. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain a single real number — the minimum time when the
i-th vertex is visited by a speedster, or
−1 if it is never visited. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
