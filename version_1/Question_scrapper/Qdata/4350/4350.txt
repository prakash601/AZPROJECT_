It is JJ's birthday and you decide to gift him a string
S (consisting of English alphabet only) of length
N. But you also know that JJ does not like palindromes so you decide that none of the substrings of
S of length
≥2 should be a palindrome.
Can you find any suitable string which can be gifted to JJ?
Recall that a string is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g.
noon and
level are palindromic strings.
Input Format
The first line contains
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
- the length of the string
S to be constructed.
Output Format
For each test case, output a string
S of length
N such that none of its substrings (of length
≥2) is a palindrome.
If there are multiple strings which satisfy the condition, print any.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1000

Output
3

4
gl
hf
waow
Explanation:
Test case 1:
gl is the only substring of length
≥2 and it is not a palindrome.
Test case 2:
hf is the only substring of length
≥2 and it is not a palindrome.
Test case 3: Following are the substrings of length
≥2:
Length=2:
wa,
ao,
ow
Length=3:
wao,
aow
Length=4:
waow
We can see that none of these substrings is a palindrome.
