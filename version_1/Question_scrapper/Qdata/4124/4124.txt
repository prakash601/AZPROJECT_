Chef has an array consisting of
N+K−1 integers. The array contains only the first
N positive odd numbers. Each number appears exactly once, except for one number which appears exactly
K times. The sum of integers in Chef's array is equal to
S.
For example, for
N=3,
K=2, the possible arrays could be
[1,1,3,5],
[3,1,3,5],
[5,3,5,1]. For
N=1,
K=3, there is only one possible array:
[1,1,1].
Chef gives you three integers
N,
K and
S and asks you to find the only element which appears
K times in his array.
It is guaranteed that for the given input, there exists a valid array consisting of
N+K−1 elements with a sum exactly equal to
S.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,K,S.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the integer which appeared
K times in Chef's array.
