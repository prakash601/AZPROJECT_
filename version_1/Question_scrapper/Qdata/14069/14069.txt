You are given a quadratic equation with integer coefficients A * X2 + B * X + C = 0. It is guaranteed that A ≠ 0 and that the equation has at least one real root. Output the roots of the equation.
Input
The only line of input contains integers A, B and C ( - 1000 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 1000, A ≠ 0), separated by spaces.
Output
Output the roots of the equation in increasing order. If the equation has a single root of multiplicity 2, output it once. The root is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 4.
