You have an array of positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
, of length
n
. You are also given a positive integer
b
.
You are allowed to perform the following operations (possibly several) times in any order:
Choose some
1≤i≤n
, and replace
ai
with
⌈
ai
2
⌉
. Here,
⌈x⌉
denotes the smallest integer not less than
x
.
Choose some
1≤i≤n
, and replace
ai
with
max(ai−b,0)
.
However, you must also follow these rules:
You can perform at most
k1
operations of type 1 in total.
You can perform at most
k2
operations of type 2 in total.
For all
1≤i≤n
, you can perform at most
1
operation of type 1 on element
ai
.
For all
1≤i≤n
, you can perform at most
1
operation of type 2 on element
ai
.
The cost of an array is the sum of its elements. Find the minimum cost of
a
you can achieve by performing these operations.
Input
Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
, the number of test cases (
1≤t≤5000
).
The first line of each test case contains
n
,
b
,
k1
, and
k2
(
1≤n≤5000
,
1≤b≤109
,
0≤k1,k2≤n
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
describing the array
a
(
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5000
.
Output
For each test case, print the minimum cost of
a
you can achieve by performing the operations.

Note
In the first test case, you can do the following:
Perform operation 2 on element
a3
. It changes from
5
to
3
.
Perform operation 1 on element
a1
. It changes from
9
to
5
.
After these operations, the array is
a=[5,3,3]
has a cost
5+3+3=11
. We can show that this is the minimum achievable cost.
In the second test case, note that we are not allowed to perform operation 1 more than once on
a1
. So it is optimal to apply operation 1 once to each
a1
and
a2
. Alternatively we could apply operation 1 only once to
a1
, since it has no effect on
a2
.
In the third test case, here is one way to achieve a cost of
23
:
Apply operation 1 to
a4
. It changes from
19
to
10
.
Apply operation 2 to
a4
. It changes from
10
to
7
.
After these operations,
a=[2,8,3,7,3]
. The cost of
a
is
2+8+3+7+3=23
. We can show that this is the minimum achievable cost.
