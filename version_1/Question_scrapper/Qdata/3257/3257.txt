Given an array arr[] of n numbers. The task is to print only those numbers whose digits are from set {1,2,3}.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 3
arr[] = {4,6,7}
Output: -1
Explanation: No elements are there in the 
array which contains digits 1, 2 or 3.
Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1,2,3,4}
Output: 1 2 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are the only 
elements in the array which conatins 
digits as 1, 2 or 3.
Your Task:
Complete findAll function and marked satisfied number as '1' in the map mp in range 1 to 1000000. If no number is marked as satified number -1 will automatically be printed by the drivers code. The driver code prints the elements in sorted order.
Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(n)
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 106
