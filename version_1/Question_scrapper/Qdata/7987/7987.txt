Misha had been banned from playing chess for good since he was accused of cheating with an engine. Therefore, he retired and decided to become a xorcerer.
One day, while taking a walk in a park, Misha came across a rooted tree with nodes numbered from
1
to
n
. The root of the tree is node
1
.
For each
1≤i≤n
, node
i
contains
ai
stones in it. Misha has recently learned a new spell in his xorcery class and wants to test it out. A spell consists of:
Choose some node
i
(
1≤i≤n
).
Calculate the bitwise XOR
x
of all
aj
such that node
j
is in the subtree of
i
(
i
belongs to its own subtree).
Set
aj
equal to
x
for all nodes
j
in the subtree of
i
.
Misha can perform at most
2n
spells and he wants to remove all stones from the tree. More formally, he wants
ai=0
to hold for each
1≤i≤n
. Can you help him perform the spells?
A tree with
n
nodes is a connected acyclic graph which contains
n−1
edges. The subtree of node
i
is the set of all nodes
j
such that
i
lies on the simple path from
1
(the root) to
j
. We consider
i
to be contained in its own subtree.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the size of the tree
The second line contains an array of integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤31
), describing the number of stones in each node initially.
The third line contains an array of integers
p2,p3,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤i−1
), where
pi
means that there is an edge connecting
pi
and
i
.
Output
If there is not a valid sequence of spells, output
−1
.
Otherwise, output a single integer
q
(
0≤q≤2n
) in the first line — the number of performed spells.
In the second line output a sequence of integers
v1,v2,…,vq
(
1≤vi≤n
) — the
i
-th spell will be performed on the subtree of node
vi
. Please note that order matters.
If multiple solutions exist, output any. You don't have to minimize the number of operations.

Note
Please refer to the following pictures for an explanation of the third test. Only the first
4
spells are shown since the last
2
do nothing. The first picture represents the tree initially with the number of stones for each node written above it in green. Changes applied by the current spell are highlighted in red.
