Chef has an array
A of
N positive integers. Chef can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times on the array.
Choose any index
i such that
(1<i≤N);
Choose an integer
X such that
(1≤X≤A
i
);
Set
A
(i−1)
:=A
(i−1)
+X;

Help Chef to minimize the maximum value of array
A using the above operations .
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the size of array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-seperated integers, the elements of array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimized maximum value possible of array
A.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider the following
3 operations on the array.
Choose
i=3 and
X=4. Here
X≤A
3
. After operation, the array becomes
[1,9,3,6].
Choose
i=2 and
X=4. Here
X≤A
2
. After operation, the array becomes
[5,5,3,6].
Choose
i=4 and
X=1. Here
X≤A
4
. After operation, the array becomes
[5,5,4,5].
So the minimum value of maximum element of array is
5.
Test case
2: Consider the following
2 operations on the array.
Choose
i=2 and
X=8. Here
X≤A
2
. After operation, the array becomes
[13,7,19].
Choose
i=3 and
X=6. Here
X≤A
3
. After operation, the array becomes
[13,13,13].
So the minimum value of maximum element of array is
5.
Test case
3: We cannot make
A
1
less than
10 using any number of operations. Thus, the minimum value of maximum element is
10.
