Eugene got Burenka an array
a
of length
n
of integers from
1
to
m
for her birthday. Burenka knows that Eugene really likes coprime integers (integers
x
and
y
such that they have only one common factor (equal to
1
)) so she wants to to ask Eugene
q
questions about the present.
Each time Burenka will choose a subsegment
al,al+1,…,ar
of array
a
, and compute the product of these numbers
p=al⋅al+1⋅…⋅ar
. Then she will ask Eugene to count the number of integers between
1
and
C
inclusive which are coprime with
p
.
Help Eugene answer all the questions!
Input
In the first line of input there are four integers
n
,
m
,
C
,
q
(
1≤n,q≤105
,
1≤m≤2⋅104
,
1≤C≤105
) — the length of the array
a
, the maximum possible value of
ai
, the value
C
, and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤m
) — the array
a
.
In the next
q
lines the queries are given. Each query consists of two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
).
Output
Print
q
integers — the answers to Burenka's queries.
Example
input
Copy
5 5 5 3
1 2 3 2 5
1 1
2 4
4 5
output
Copy
5
2
2
Note
Here's an explanation for the example:
in the first query, the product is equal to
1
, which is coprime with
1,2,3,4,5
.
in the second query, the product is equal to
12
, which is coprime with
1
and
5
.
in the third query, the product is equal to
10
, which is coprime with
1
and
3
.
