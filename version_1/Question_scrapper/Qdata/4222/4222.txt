,…,A
N
. He needs to find the number of pairs
(i,j) (
1≤i<j≤N) such that
A
i
+A
j
=A
i
⋅A
j
. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the desired number of pairs.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The only valid pair is
(1,3).
Example case 2: We can see that no valid pair exists.
