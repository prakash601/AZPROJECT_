For a square matrix of integers of size
𝑛×𝑛
, let's define its beauty as follows: for each pair of side-adjacent elements
𝑥
and
𝑦
, write out the number
|𝑥−𝑦|
, and then find the number of different numbers among them.
For example, for the matrix
(
1
4
3
2
)
(
the numbers we consider are
|1−3|=2
,
|1−4|=3
,
|3−2|=1
and
|4−2|=2
; there are
3
different numbers among them (
2
,
3
and
1
), which means that its beauty is equal to
3
.
You are given an integer
𝑛
. You have to find a matrix of size
𝑛×𝑛
, where each integer from
1
to
𝑛
2
occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤49
) – the number of test cases.
The first (and only) line of each test case contains a single integer
𝑛
(
2≤𝑛≤50
).
Output
For each test case, print
𝑛
rows of
𝑛
integers — a matrix of integers of size
𝑛×𝑛
, where each number from
1
to
𝑛
2
occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
