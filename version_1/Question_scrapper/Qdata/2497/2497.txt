Given a Binary Tree of size N, you need to find all the possible paths from root node to all the leaf node's of the binary tree.
Example 1:
Input:
 1
 / \
 2 3
Output: 1 2 #1 3 #
Explanation: 
All possible paths:
1->2
1->3
Example 2:
Input:
  10
  / \
  20 30
  / \
  40 60
Output: 10 20 40 #10 20 60 #10 30 #
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function Paths() that takes the root node as an argument and return all the possible path. (All the path are printed '#' separated by the driver's code.)
Note: The return type
cpp: vector
java: ArrayList>
python: list of list
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(H).
Note: H is the height of the tree.
Constraints:
1<=N<=103.
