You are given a rooted tree. It contains
n
vertices, which are numbered from
1
to
n
. The root is the vertex
1
.
Each edge has two positive integer values. Thus, two positive integers
aj
and
bj
are given for each edge.
Output
n−1
numbers
r2,r3,…,rn
, where
ri
is defined as follows.
Consider the path from the root (vertex
1
) to
i
(
2≤i≤n
). Let the sum of the costs of
aj
along this path be
Ai
. Then
ri
is equal to the length of the maximum prefix of this path such that the sum of
bj
along this prefix does not exceed
Ai
.
Example for
n=9
. The blue color shows the costs of
aj
, and the red color shows the costs of
bj
.
Consider an example. In this case:
r2=0
, since the path to
2
has an amount of
aj
equal to
5
, only the prefix of this path of length
0
has a smaller or equal amount of
bj
;
r3=3
, since the path to
3
has an amount of
aj
equal to
5+9+5=19
, the prefix of length
3
of this path has a sum of
bj
equal to
6+10+1=17
( the number is
17≤19
);
r4=1
, since the path to
4
has an amount of
aj
equal to
5+9=14
, the prefix of length
1
of this path has an amount of
bj
equal to
6
(this is the longest suitable prefix, since the prefix of length
2
already has an amount of
bj
equal to
6+10=16
, which is more than
14
);
r5=2
, since the path to
5
has an amount of
aj
equal to
5+9+2=16
, the prefix of length
2
of this path has a sum of
bj
equal to
6+10=16
(this is the longest suitable prefix, since the prefix of length
3
already has an amount of
bj
equal to
6+10+1=17
, what is more than
16
);
r6=1
, since the path up to
6
has an amount of
aj
equal to
2
, the prefix of length
1
of this path has an amount of
bj
equal to
1
;
r7=1
, since the path to
7
has an amount of
aj
equal to
5+3=8
, the prefix of length
1
of this path has an amount of
bj
equal to
6
(this is the longest suitable prefix, since the prefix of length
2
already has an amount of
bj
equal to
6+3=9
, which is more than
8
);
r8=2
, since the path up to
8
has an amount of
aj
equal to
2+4=6
, the prefix of length
2
of this path has an amount of
bj
equal to
1+3=4
;
r9=3
, since the path to
9
has an amount of
aj
equal to
2+4+1=7
, the prefix of length
3
of this path has a sum of
bj
equal to
1+3+3=7
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases in the test.
The descriptions of test cases follow.
Each description begins with a line that contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
This is followed by
n−1
string, each of which contains three numbers
pj,aj,bj
(
1≤pj≤n
;
1≤aj,bj≤109
) — the ancestor of the vertex
j
, the first and second values an edge that leads from
pj
to
j
. The value of
j
runs through all values from
2
to
n
inclusive. It is guaranteed that each set of input data has a correct hanged tree with a root at the vertex
1
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all input test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output
n−1
integer in one line:
r2,r3,…,rn
.

Note
The first example is clarified in the statement.
In the second example:
r2=0
, since the path to
2
has an amount of
aj
equal to
1
, only the prefix of this path of length
0
has a smaller or equal amount of
bj
;
r3=0
, since the path to
3
has an amount of
aj
equal to
1+1=2
, the prefix of length
1
of this path has an amount of
bj
equal to
100
(
100>2
);
r4=3
, since the path to
4
has an amount of
aj
equal to
1+1+101=103
, the prefix of length
3
of this path has an amount of
bj
equal to
102
