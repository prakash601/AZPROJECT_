Given an array
A of length
N such that
1≤A
i
≤N and
A
i

=i,
∀i∈[1,N].
Count the number of arrays
B of length
N such that
∀i∈[1,N]:
B
i

=B
A

1≤B
i
≤M
Since the answer may be large, print it modulo
10

+7.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T − the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains
2 lines of input:
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers
N,
M.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers
A
