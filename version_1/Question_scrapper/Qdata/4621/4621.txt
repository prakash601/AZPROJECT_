You are given a fair coin and two integers
X and
N.
You repeatedly flip the coin and perform the following operation based on the result:
If it lands on heads, then
X will increase by
1. However, if
X=N then
X will not change.
If it lands on tails,
X will decrease by
1.
You stop as soon as the value of
X becomes
1.
Find the expected number of coin flips.
Note that it is guaranteed that under the given constraints, the answer is an integer and does not exceed
2⋅10

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers
X and
N.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the expected number of coin flips.

Explanation:
In the first test case,
X is already
1. So, the expected number of coin flip in this case is
0.
In the second test case, if the coin lands on head,
X will not change because
X is equal to
N here. Whenever the coin lands on tail,
X will decrease by
1 and the game ends as
X becomes
1. The expected number of coin flips to get the first tail is
2. So, the answer for the case is
2.
