Dr.D is bored, so he's making up problems to pass the time. Here is one of them.
You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Find the number of 7-tuples of indices
(a,b,c,d,e,f,g) such that:
1≤a<b<c<d<e<f<g≤N
A
g
<A
e
<A
f
<A
d
<A
b
<A
c
<A
a
Since this number could be huge, compute it modulo
987654319.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of tuples modulo
987654319.
