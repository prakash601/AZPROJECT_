You are given a binary square matrix
A of size
N×N. Let the value at cell
(i,j) be denoted by
A(i,j).
Your task is to count the number of square frames present in the grid. A square frame is defined to be a square submatrix of
A whose border elements are all '1'.
Formally,
A square submatrix of
A of size
k with top-left corner
(i,j) is defined to be the set of cells
{(i+x,j+y)∣0≤x,y<k}. Note that this requires
i+k−1≤N and
j+k−1≤N.
A square frame of size
k with top-left corner
(i,j) is defined to be a square submatrix of size
k such that
A(i+x,j+y)= 1 whenever
x=0 or
y= or
or
. There is no constraint on the values of elements strictly inside the frame.
Refer to the sample explanation for more details.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the size of the grid.
Each of the next
N lines contains a string consisting of
N characters. The
i-th such string represents the
i-th row of
A. Each character of each string is either 0 or 1.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the count of square frames in the grid.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: There is
1 square frame, the submatrix containing index
(1,1).
Test Case
2: There are
14 square frames of size
1,
2 of size
2, and
1 of size
4.
Some of the square frames are :
The frame of size
1 containing point
(3,3).
The frame of size
2 with corner points
(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1).
The frame of size
2 with corner points
(3,3),(4,3),(4,4),(3,4).
The frame of size
4 with corner points
(1,1),(1,4),(4,4),(4,1).
