Given two integers
A and
B.
Let
P denote a sequence of
N prime numbers such that the sum of the sequence is
A.
Let
Q denote a sequence of
M prime numbers such that the sum of the sequence is
B.
Let
X denote the maximum absolute difference between
P
i
and
Q
j
among all valid pairs
(i,j) such that
(1≤i≤N) and
(1≤j≤M). Find the minimum possible value of
X over all possible sequences
P and
Q.
More formally, for all possible sequences
P and
Q, find the minimum value of
max(∣P
i
−Q
j
∣), where
(1≤i≤N) and
(1≤j≤M).
Print
−1 if any one of the sequences cannot be formed.
Note that,
∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of a number
X. For example,
∣−4∣=4 and
∣7∣=7.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each test case, find the minimum possible value of the maximum absolute difference between
P
i
and
Q
j
for
(1≤i≤N) and
(1≤j≤M). If any of the sequences can not be formed, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Let
P={3} and
Q={3,3}.
The maximum absolute difference is
0. It can be shown that the maximum absolute difference can not be less than
0.
Test case
2: The only possible sequences are
P={3} and
Q={2}.
The maximum absolute difference is
1. It can be shown that the maximum absolute difference can not be less than
1.
