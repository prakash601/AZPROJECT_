Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers. He started testing the robot by letting it move on a line.
Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate
x=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of
N commands, described by a string
S with length
N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left (decreasing
x by
1) or to the right (increasing
x by
1), respectively.
How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? A point
p is visited by the robot if
p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X.
The second line contains a single string
S with length
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of points visited by the robot.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
∣X∣≤1,000,000
S contains only characters 'L' and 'R'

Explanation:
Example case 1: The robot followed the path
10→11→12→11→10→9→8.
Example case 2: The robot followed the path
0→−1→−2.
