You are given a string
S with length
N. Determine if it is possible to find two non-empty strings
A and
B which satisfy the following conditions:
A+B=S, where
+ denotes string concatenation
B is a substring of
A
Note:
B is a substring of
A if
B can be obtained from
A by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end. For example, "ab" is a substring of "cabd", but "ad" is not.
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains a single string
S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find strings
A and
B satisfying the given conditions or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints
1≤T≤10
4
2≤N≤10
5
∣S∣=N
S contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10

Explanation:
Example case 1: We can choose "cabd" as
A and "ab" as
B. We can see that
A+B=S and
B is a substring of
A.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find two strings which satisfy the constraints. For example, when
A is "yourcrushlovesyou" and
B is "back", then
A+B=S, but
B is not a substring of
A.
Example case 3: We can choose "wubbalubbadub" as
A and "dub" as
B.
