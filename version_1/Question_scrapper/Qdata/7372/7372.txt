The tennis tournament you organized has just finished and now you have to decide the ranking of the
N players (indexed by
1,2,…,N) who participated. Each pair of players played exactly one game and for each game you know who won (there are no draws in tennis).
A ranking is a permutation
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
of
1,2,…,N; where
P
1
represents the winner of the tournament,
P
2
is the second in the ranking, etc.
A ranking is good if for any
1≤i<j≤min(i+⌈
2
N
⌉,N) the player
P
i
won against
P
j
. In other words, a ranking is good if, for any two players whose ranking positions differ by at most
⌈
N
⌉, the result of their game is consistent with their order in the ranking.
Find, if it exists, a good ranking.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, the number of test cases. Then
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N, the number of participants.
Then
N lines follow. The
i-th of them contains a string
S
i
of length
n whose characters are either 0 or 1. For any
1≤j≤N with
j

=i, the
j-th character of
S
i
is 0 if
i lost against
j and 1 otherwise. It is guaranteed that for any
i

=j the
j-th character of
S
i
is different from the
i-th character of
S
j
(so that they are consistent). For any
1≤i≤N, the
i-th character of
S
i
is 0 (notice that this character does not correspond to any game in the tournament).
Output Format
For each test case, print
−1 if a good ranking does not exist.
If a good ranking exists, print on a single line the
n integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
corresponding to a good ranking (
P
1
is the winning player,
P
2
is the runner-up,
P
3
is the third in the ranking, etc.).
If there is more than one good ranking, print any of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1000
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
1000.

Explanation:
Explanation of the first testcase: There is only one participant and the only possible ranking is good.
Explanation of the second testcase: There are two participants and the participant
2 won against the participant
1. Thus the ranking
2,1 (that is, player
2 wins the tournament) is good.
Explanation of the third testcase: One may check that there is not a good ranking. Let us explain why some possible rankings are not good:
The ranking
P
1
=1,P
2
=2,P
3
=3 is not good because for
i=1,
j=3 (notice that
1≤i<j≤min(N,i+⌈
2
N
⌉) since
⌈
2
N
⌉=2) the result of the game between
P
i
=1 and
P
j
=3 is not consistent with their ranking positions (player
1 lost against player
3 but
1 has a better ranking position).
The ranking
P
1
=3,P
2
=2,P
3
=1 is not good because for
i=1,
j=2 (notice that
1≤i<j≤min(N,i+⌈
2
N
⌉) since
⌈
2
N
⌉=2) the result of the game between
P
i
=3 and
P
j
=2 is not consistent with their ranking positions.
