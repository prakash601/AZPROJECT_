Priya loves bitwise AND, but she hates programming. Help her solve this problem.
Given an array
A of size
N, let
B
ij
denote the bitwise AND of
A[i] and
A[j]. You have to find the number of pairs
(i,j), such that
i<j and
B
ij
=A[i].
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case consists of a single integer
N, denoting the Size of Array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
...A
N
.
###Output: For each test case, output a single line, count of such pairs.
###Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤A[i]≤100

Explanation:
Example case 1: Number of valid pairs are -
(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5) and
(4,5). Therefore, total valid pairs
=10.
Example case 2: Since
N=1, therefore there are no valid pairs.
