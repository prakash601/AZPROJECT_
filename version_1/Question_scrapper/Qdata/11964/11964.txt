Abendsen assigned a mission to Juliana. In this mission, Juliana has a rooted tree with
n
vertices. Vertex number
1
is the root of this tree. Each vertex can be either black or white. At first, all vertices are white. Juliana is asked to process
q
queries. Each query is one of three types:
If vertex
v
is white, mark it as black; otherwise, perform this operation on all direct sons of
v
instead.
Mark all vertices in the subtree of
v
(including
v
) as white.
Find the color of the
i
-th vertex.
An example of operation "1 1" (corresponds to the first example test). The vertices
1
and
2
are already black, so the operation goes to their sons instead.
Can you help Juliana to process all these queries?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤105
,
1≤q≤105
) — the number of vertices and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
p2,p3,…,pn
(
1≤pi<i
), where
pi
means that there is an edge between vertices
i
and
pi
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
ti
and
vi
(
1≤ti≤3
,
1≤vi≤n
) — the type of the
i
-th query and the vertex of the
i
-th query.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.
Output
For each query of type
3
, print "black" if the vertex is black; otherwise, print "white".
