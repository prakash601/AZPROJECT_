Given an integer
x, find two non-negative integers
a and
b such that
(a∧b)+(a∨b)=x, where
∧ is the bitwise AND operation and
∨ is the bitwise OR operation.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
x.
Output
If there is no valid pair
(a,b), print a single line containing the integer
−1. Otherwise, print a single line containing two space-separated integers
a and
b.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them.
