A tuple of positive integers
(a,b,c) is said to be a bad tuple if
a,b,c are distinct,
a divides
b, and
b divides
c. For example,
(1,2,4) and
(7,21,42) are bad tuples while
(1,2,3) and
(2,4,4) are not.
Chef has the
N integers from
1 to
N with him. He wants to pick a subset of these numbers such that it doesn't contain a bad tuple. How many distinct subsets can he pick?
Input Format

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
4 subsets in total —
{},
{1},
{2},
{1,2}. None of these subsets violate the condition.
Test case
2: There are
16 subsets in total, out of which
2 subsets —
{1,2,4} and
{1,2,3,4} — violate the given condition as they contain the bad tuple
(1,2,4) in them.
