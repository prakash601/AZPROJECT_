oolimry has an array
a
of length
n
which he really likes. Today, you have changed his array to
b
, a permutation of
a
, to make him sad.
Because oolimry is only a duck, he can only perform the following operation to restore his array:
Choose two integers
i,j
such that
1≤i,j≤n
.
Swap
bi
and
bj
.
The sadness of the array
b
is the minimum number of operations needed to transform
b
into
a
.
Given the array
a
, find any array
b
which is a permutation of
a
that has the maximum sadness over all permutations of the array
a
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
)  — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
)  — elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
— describing the array
b
. If there are multiple answers, you may print any.

1 2 3 3
output
Copy
1 2
3 3 2 1
Note
In the first test case, the array
[1,2]
has sadness
1
. We can transform
[1,2]
into
[2,1]
using one operation with
(i,j)=(1,2)
.
In the second test case, the array
[3,3,2,1]
has sadness
2
. We can transform
[3,3,2,1]
into
[1,2,3,3]
with two operations with
(i,j)=(1,4)
and
(i,j)=(2,3)
respectively.
