Chef is planning a heist in the reserve bank of Chefland. They are planning to hijack the bank for
D days and print the money. The initial rate of printing the currency is
P dollars per day and they increase the production by
Q dollars after every interval of
d days. For example, after
d days the rate is
P+Q dollars per day, and after
2d days the rate is
P+2Q dollars per day, and so on. Output the amount of money they will be able to print in the given period.

Explanation:
Test Case
1:
On the first day, the rate of production is
1 dollar per day so
1 dollar is printed on the first day.
On the second day, the rate of production is
1+1=2 dollars per day so
2 dollars are printed on the second day.
The total amount of money printed in
2 days is
1+2=3 dollars.
Test Case
2:
For the first two days, the rate of production is
1 dollar per day so
1⋅2=2 dollars are printed on the first two days.
On the third day, the rate of production is
1+1=2 dollars per day so
2 dollars are printed on the third day.
The total amount of money printed in
3 days is
2+2=4 dollars.
Test Case
3:
For the first two days, the rate of production is
1 dollar per day so
1⋅2=2 dollars are printed on the first two days.
On the next two days, the rate of production is
1+2=3 dollars per day so
3⋅2=6 dollars are printed on the next two days.
On the last day, the rate of production is
3+2=5 dollars per day so
5 dollars are printed on the last day.
The total amount of money printed in
5 days is
2+6+5=13 dollars.
