Vivek is quite fond of expected values. One day, he stumbled upon the following problem. He cannot solve it, so he is asking you for help.
Consider all trees with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N); two trees are different if there is a pair of vertices
u and
v such that there is an edge between vertices
u and
v in exactly one of these trees.
For a uniformly randomly chosen tree
T, let's denote the degrees of vertices
1 through
N in this tree by
d
1
,d
2
,…,d
N
. Then, let's denote
A=(d
1
⋅d
2
⋅…⋅d
N
)
K
. Find the expected value of
A.
It can be proved that the expected value of
A can be expressed as a fraction
P/Q, where
P and
Q are coprime positive integers and
Q is coprime to
998,244,353. You should compute the value of
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353, where
Q
−1
denotes the multiplicative inverse of
Q modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ―
P⋅Q
−1
(mod998244353).

Explanation:
Example case 1: There are
3 labelled trees with size
3: the paths
[1−2−3],
[1−3−2] and
[3−1−2].
The expected value is
(
((1⋅2⋅1)

)/3=2, so
P=2,
Q=1,
Q

=1 and the answer is
2.
