Chef has two non negative integers
N and
X. He now wants to find the number of integers
K such that
0≤K<N, and
(N⊕K)&X=0.
Note that
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator and
& denotes the bitwise AND operator.
Help Chef in finding the total required count.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing
N and
X denoting the two integers as described in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output the total number of integers
K which satisfy the requirements mentioned.

Explanation:
Testcase 1:
N=4,X=5. So we need to find the number of
K, which satisfy
0≤K<4, and
(4⊕K)&5=0.

So, we have looked at all values of
K, and found no value which satisfies the requirements. So the answer is
0.
