The Petrozavodsk camp takes place in about one month. Jafar wants to participate in the camp, but guess what? His coach is Yalalovichik.
Yalalovichik is a legendary coach, famous in the history of competitive programming. However, he is only willing to send to the camp students who solve really hard problems on Timus. He started a marathon at the beginning of December. Initially, he said that people who solve 200 or more problems by the 31-st of December may go to the camp. Jafar made a schedule for the next month. For each day, he knows how many problems he is going to solve.
The problem is that Yalalovichik is a really moody coach — he may wake up tomorrow and change his decision about the deadline and the number of problems that must be solved by this deadline to qualify for the camp. Jafar has
Q such scenarios. Now he wants to know: in each scenario, if he does not change his problem solving schedule, will he go to the camp or not?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
D - the number of days in Jafar's schedule.
D lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤D), the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
d
i
and
p
i
denoting that Jafar will solve
p
i
problems on day
d
i
.
The next line contains a single integer
Q denoting the number of scenarios Jafar considers.
Q lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤Q), the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
dead
i
and
req
i
denoting a scenario where Yalaovichik decides that students who solve
req
i
problems by day
dead
i
(inclusive) will go to the camp.
Output
For each scenario, print a single line containing the string "Go Camp" if Jafar is going to the camp or "Go Sleep" otherwise (without quotes).

Explanation:
Example case 1:
By the end of day
9, Jafar will not have any problem solved.
By the end of day
15, Jafar will have
9 problems solved, which is enough to go to the camp, since he needs at least
7 problems.
