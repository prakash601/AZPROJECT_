You are given a connected graph with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and
N−1 bidirectional edges. Also, you are given a sequence
K
1
,K
2
,…,K
N
.
Let's denote the distance between vertices
u and
v by
d(u,v). Next, for each valid
i, let's define
D
i
as the maximum integer such that there are at least
K
i
vertices
v with
d(i,v)>D
i
. (It can be proven that such integers exist for the given constraints.)
Your task is to find the values of
D
1
,D
2
,…,D
N
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
K

,…,K
N
.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integeres
u and
v denoting that vertices
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Output
Print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
