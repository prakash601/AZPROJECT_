Chef has two strings
A and
B consisting of lowercase alphabets, each of length
N. Help Chef in finding the number of indices
i
(1≤i≤N) such that
A[i…N]<B[i…N].
S[i…N] denotes the suffix of string
S starting at index
i, i.e.
S
i
S
i+1
…
S
N
.
String
S< String
T denotes that
S is lexicographically smaller than
T. If two strings
S and
T have the same length
N, we say that
S is lexicographically smaller than
T if there exists an index
i(1≤i≤N) such that
S

=T
1
,
S
2
=T

,…,S
i−1
=T
i−1
and
S

<T
i
. For example, "
abc" is lexicographically smaller than "
acd", "
abe", but not smaller than "
abc", "
aac".
Input Format
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains
N, denoting the length of the strings
A and
B.
The second line of each test case contains the string
A.
The third line of each test case contains the string
B.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of indices
i such that
A[i…N]<B[i…N].
Constraints

The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed

Explanation:
Test Case
1:
For
i=1,
A[1…2]= "
ab",
B[1…2]= "
bb" and lexicographically, "
ab"
< "
bb".
For
i=2,
A[2…2]= "
b",
B[2…2]= "
b" and lexicographically, "
b"
= "
b".
Test Case
2: For each
i∈{1,2,3},
A[i…3]<B[i…3].
