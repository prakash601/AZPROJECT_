Given a string S, Check if characters of the given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
Note: You have to return 1 if it is possible to convert the given string into palindrome else return 0. 
Example 1:
Input:
S = "geeksogeeks"
Output: Yes
Explanation: The string can be converted
into a palindrome: geeksoskeeg
Example 2:
Input: 
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: No
Explanation: The given string can't be
converted into a palindrome.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPossible() which takes the string S as input and returns 1 if the string can be converted into a palindrome. Else, it returns 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Distinct Characters).

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 106
