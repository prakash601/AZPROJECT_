Alice is still not satisfied with Bob's math skills so she gave him a new challenge.
Given a positive integer
N, find any
3 distinct positive integers
A,B,C such that:
The product of any two of these
3 integers is a divisor of
N.
The product of all three integers is a multiple of
N.
If multiple solutions exist, you may print any of them.
Print
−1 if no solution exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer,
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line three space-separated integers satisfying the given condition.
Print
−1 if the answer does not exist.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
A=2,B=3,C=5. They satisfy all the conditions:
AB=6,AC=10,BC=15 are all divisors of
N=30
ABC=30 is a multiple of
N=30
Test case
2: We have
A=2,B=6,C=4. They satisfy all the conditions:
AB=12,AC=8,BC=24 are all divisors of
N=24
ABC=48 is a multiple of
N=24
Test case
3: It can be shown that no three positive integers
A,B,C satisfy the conditions.
