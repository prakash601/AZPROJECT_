There is a country which has
n houses and
m bi-directional roads between these houses, where the
i
th
road connects house
u
i
to
v
i
. A subset of these houses
S is called a city if any house in
S is reachable from any other house in
S. Formally, a subset of houses
S is a city if
x and
y are reachable from each other for all
x,y∈S. The funding required for a city
S consisting of
k houses is defined as
k
2
.
The president has given the mayor Saarang an order: divide the country into
2 cities with exactly one road connecting them. In other words, divide the country into two cities
S
1
and
S
2
such that:
Each house
i either belongs to
S
1
or
S
2
.
There exists a single road connect a house
x from
S
1
and a house
y from
S
2
.
For this purpose, you are allowed to build more bi-directional roads. The funding required to build a road between any
2 houses is
c.
Saarang, however, is busy preparing for his board exams so he requests you to solve this problem for him. Find the minimum total funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or
−1 if no division is possible.
Note: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the
2 cities and the roads built. If after the division, the two cities have
x and
n−x houses respectively and you have built a total of
a roads, The total funding will be
x
2
+(n−x)

+c×a.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case consists of three integers
n,
m and
c.
m lines follow, each consisting of
2 integers
u
i
and
v
i
indicating a road between houses
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or
−1 if no division is possible.

Explanation:
Test case
1: there is no way to divide the country according to the mayor's requirements.

Test case
2: consider the
2 cities consisting of
{2,3,5,6} and
{1,4} houses respectively. There are no new roads built. The total funding is
4
2
+2
2
=20. This is the optimal assignment.


- Test case $3$: build a road between $2$ and $4$. Consider the $2$ cities consisting of $\{3, 5, 6\}$ and $\{1, 2, 4\}$ houses respectively. The total funding is $3^2 + 3^2 + 7 \times 1 = 25$. This is the optimal assignment.

- Test case $4$: build a road between $2$ and $4$ and between $5$ and $7$. Consider the $2$ cities consisting of $\{1, 2, 4, 7\}$ and $\{3, 5, 6\}$ houses respectively. The total funding is $4^2 + 3^2 + 4 \times 2 = 33$. This is the optimal assignment.

Note for all test cases that there may be multiple ways to get the same funding but there is no other division which has a smaller funding.
