The MEX of a set of integers is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to this set. For example,
MEX({0,2,3})=1 and
MEX({1,3})=0.
Chef has a tree with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). The tree is rooted at node
1. Chef wants to assign a non-negative integer to each node in such a way that each integer between
0 and
N−1 (inclusive) is assigned to exactly one node.
For each node
u, consider the integers assigned to the nodes in the subtree of
u (including
u); let
a
denote the MEX of these integers. Chef wants
a
+a
2
+…+a
N
to be as large as possible. Find the maximum possible value of this sum.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
p

,p

,…,p
N−1
. For each valid
i, the node
p
i
is the parent of the node
i+1.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum sum of subtree MEX-s which can be obtained if you assign the weights optimally.
