Ayush has two rooted trees. Each of them contains
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N); let's denote a vertex
v in tree
1 by
v
1
and a corresponding vertex
v in tree
2 by
v
2
.
For each tree
t, any vertex on the path from the root to a vertex
v
t
(including
v
t
) is an ancestor of
v
t
and the depth of
v
t
is the distance of
v
t
from the root of tree
t.
For any integer
w (
1≤w≤N) and vertices
u
1
and
v
2
,
w is said to be a common ancestor of
u
1
and
v
2
if:
in tree
1,
w
1
is an ancestor of
u
1
in tree
2,
w
2
is an ancestor of
v
2
the depths of vertices
w
1
and
w
2
(from their respective roots) are the same
For example, in the figure above, the pair
(u
1
,v
2
)=(6,1) has two common ancestors —
4 and
6. Although vertex
2 is an ancestor for each of them, the depths of
2
1
and
2
2
are not the same.
Help Ayush find the maximum number of common ancestors for a pair of vertices, i.e. the largest integer
c such that there is a pair of vertices
(u
1
,v
2
) (possibly
u=v) with
c common ancestors.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
N
. For each valid
i,
p
i
is the parent of the vertex
i
1
or
−1 if the vertex
i
1
is the root of tree
1.
The third line contains
N space-separated integers
q
1
,q
2
,…,q
N
. Similarly, for each valid
i,
q
i
is the parent of the vertex
i
2
or
−1 if the vertex
i
2
is the root of tree
2.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of common ancestors for a pair
(u
1
,v
2
).

Explanation:
Example case 1: There is only one pair
(u
1
,v
2
)=(1
1
,1
2
) and only one common ancestor.
Example case 2: If
u=1, then
1 and
2 are common ancestors for any
v.
Example case 3: The maximum number of common ancestors is
2, e.g.
4 and
6 for
(u
1
,v
2
)=(6,1), as shown in the figure in the statement.
