Given a string, remove spaces from it. 
Example 1:
Input:
S = "geeks  for geeks"
Output: geeksforgeeks
Explanation: All the spaces have been 
removed.
Example 2:
Input: 
S = "    g f g"
Output: gfg
Explanation: All the spaces including
the leading ones have been removed.


You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by removing all the white spaces from S.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
