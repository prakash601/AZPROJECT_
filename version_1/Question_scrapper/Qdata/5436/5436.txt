Given
N points in a
2D space, find the minimum sum of areas of rectangles required to cover all the points given that we can use at most
2 non-overlapping rectangles whose sides can touch. The rectangles must be axis-aligned, meaning the sides are vertical and horizontal.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains
N+1 lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer
N, the number of points.
The next
N lines each contains two integers
x
i
,
y
i
, the coordinates of the
i-th point.
Note: Points need not be distinct.
###Output For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.

Explanation:
Case 1: Since there is only one point, the minimum area of a rectangle to cover this point is
0.
Case 2: We can have rectangles as
2 opposite sides of the square. Since the width of the rectangles is
0, the total area is also
0.
Case 3: The optimal solution is with the rectangles having endpoints
{(1,1),(100,1),(1,50),(100,50)} and
{(1,100),(1,100),(100,100),(100,100)}. Therefore the total area is
49⋅99+0⋅99=4851
