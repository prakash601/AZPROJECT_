In the 2050 Conference, some people from the competitive programming community meet together and are going to take a photo. The
n
people form a line. They are numbered from
1
to
n
from left to right. Each of them either holds a cardboard with the letter 'C' or a cardboard with the letter 'P'.
Let
C={c1,c2,…,cm}
(c1<c2<…<cm)
be the set of people who hold cardboards of 'C'. Let
P={p1,p2,…,pk}
(p1<p2<…<pk)
be the set of people who hold cardboards of 'P'. The photo is good if and only if it satisfies the following constraints:
C∪P={1,2,…,n}
C∩P=∅
.
ci−ci−1≤ci+1−ci(1<i<m)
.
pi−pi−1≥pi+1−pi(1<i<k)
.
Given an array
a1,…,an
, please find the number of good photos satisfying the following condition:
∑
x∈C
ax<
∑
y∈P
ay.
The answer can be large, so output it modulo
998244353
. Two photos are different if and only if there exists at least one person who holds a cardboard of 'C' in one photo but holds a cardboard of 'P' in the other.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤200000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤200000
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
200000
.
Output
For each test case, output the answer modulo
998244353
in a separate line.

Note
For the first test case, there are
10
possible good photos satisfying the condition: PPPPP, CPPPP, PCPPP, CCPPP, PCCPP, PCPCP, PPPPC, CPPPC, PCPPC, PPPCC.
For the second test case, there are
7
possible good photos satisfying the condition: PPPP, PCPP, PCCP, PPPC, PCPC, PPCC, PCCC.
