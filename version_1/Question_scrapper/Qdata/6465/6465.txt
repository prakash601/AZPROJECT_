Coach Chef has selected all the players and now he has to separate them into 2 teams,
A and
B.

Each player must be included in exactly one of the 2 teams and each player
x, has a skill level
S
x
. It is not necessary for both teams to have equal number of players, but they have to be non-empty.

Since the number of players is way too high, Chef doesn't have an actual list of every player individually. Instead, he keeps a list of
N pairs
{X
i
,Y
i
}, which tells him that there are
Y
i
players with skill level
X
i
.

Chef thinks that a division into 2 teams is Good, if the skill value of every player in A divides the skill value of every player in B. More formally,
S
b
modS
a
=0, ∀ a ∈ A, b ∈ B.

Since he is busy, can you help him find total number of Good divisions? Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo
998244353.

NOTE : 2 divisions are considered different if there exists any player
x belonging to different teams in the 2 divisions. (See example for more clarity).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first line for each testcase has a single integer $N$, denoting the number of pairs in Chef's list.
$N$ lines follow. Each contains 2 space separated integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$, denoting Chef has $Y_i$ players with skill level $X_i$.
Output
Output one integer for every testcase. The number of total Good divisions, modulo $998244353$.
Constraints
$1 ≤ T, N ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ X_i ≤ 10^{9}, X_i \neq X_j$ for $i \neq j$
$1 ≤ Y_i ≤ 10^{5}$
Sum of $N$ over all testcases does not exceed $10^{5}$

Explanation
Example Case 1: Only one player P1. No way to split into teams.
Example Case 2: 3 players total, P1, P2 & P3 with skill level 1, 3 & 6 respectively. Possible divisions:
A=[P1], B=[P2, P3]
A=[P1, P2], B=[P3]
Example Case 3: 4 players total, P1, P2, P3 & P4 with skill levels 1, 3, 3 & 6 respectively. Possible divisions :
A=[P1], B=[P2, P3, P4]
A=[P1, P2], B=[P3, P4]
A=[P1, P3], B=[P2, P4]
A=[P1, P2, P3], B=[P4]
