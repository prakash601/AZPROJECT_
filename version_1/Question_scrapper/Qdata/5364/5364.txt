Chef enjoys playing Among Us with the other Chefs in the kitchen. However, he struggles with the asteroids task.
The task consists of
N asteroids where the coordinates of the
i
th
asteroid are
(X
i
,Y
i
).
In one second, each non-destroyed asteroid moves to the left by
1 unit.
Formally, if an asteroid's current position is
(X,Y), then, after
1 second, it moves to the position
(X−1,Y).
Note that, an asteroid can move to a negative
X coordinate after some time.
The optimal strategy to play the game is to choose a non-destroyed asteroid having minimum
X coordinate, and destroy it.
If multiple asteroids have minimum
X coordinate, any one of them can be destroyed first.
However, Chef likes to take his chances. Each second, he chooses a non-destroyed asteroid, uniformly at random and destroys it.
Find the probability that Chef's strategy of randomly destroying the asteroids is same as the optimal strategy.
The probability can be written in the form of
Q
P
such that
Q is not divisible by
1000000007. Output the value of
P⋅Q
−1
mod
1000000007.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
N, denoting the number of asteroids.
The next
N lines describe the asteroids. The
i
th
of these
N lines contain two space-separated integers
X
i
and
Y
i
, denoting the initial position of the
i
th
asteroid.
Output Format
Print a single integer, the probability
Q
P
in the form
P⋅Q
−1
mod
1000000007.

It is guaranteed that no
2 asteroids have the same initial position.

Explanation:
There are
6 asteroids in total. The initial positions of the asteroids are:
The probability equals

, which is equivalent to
616666671.
