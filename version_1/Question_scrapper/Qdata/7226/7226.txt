You are given an array
A consisting of
N integers.
For each
K from
0 to
N find the maximum prefix sum of
A after changing the sign of at most
K elements of the array.
Formally:
Let
F(A) denote the maximum prefix sum of an array
A of length
N (including an empty array for which prefix sum is
0). Thus,
F(A) =
max(0, max
1≤i≤N
∑
j=1
i
A
j
).
Let
G(K) denote the maximum possible value of
F(A) after applying the following operation at most
K times:
Choose an index
i
(1≤i≤N) and change the sign of
i
th
element of array, i.e., set
A
i
A
i
.
For each
K from
0 to
N, find
G(K).
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

…,
A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the
N+1 integers
G(0),G(1),…,G(N) - the maximum prefix sum of
A after changing the sign of at most
K elements.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
For
K=0: Maximum prefix sum with
0 changes is
−3+4=1.
For
K=1: Maximum prefix sum with
1 change is
3+4=7. Note that we changed
A
1
from
−3 to
3.
For
K=2: Maximum prefix sum with
2 change is
3+4+2=9. Note that we changed
A
1
from
−3 to
3 and
A
3
from
−2 to
2.
For
K=3,4, and
5: Maximum prefix sum is
3+4+2+3+1=13. Note that we changed
A
1
from
−3 to
3,
A
3
from
−2 to
2, and
A
4
from
−3 to
3.
Test case
2:
For
K=0: Maximum prefix sum with
0 changes is
0 where we choose an empty prefix.
For
K=1: Maximum prefix sum with
1 changes is
8. We change the value of
A
1
from
−8 to
8.
For
K=2: Maximum prefix sum with
2 changes is
8+5=13. We change the value of
A
1
from
−8 to
8 and
A
2
from
−5 to
5.
For
K=3: Maximum prefix sum with
3 changes is
8+5+2=15. We change the value of
A
1
from
−8 to
8,
A
2
from
−5 to
5, and
A
3
from
−2 to
2.
