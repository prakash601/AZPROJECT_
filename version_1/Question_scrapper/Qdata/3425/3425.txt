Given a Directed Graph with V vertices and E edges, Find the members of strongly connected components in the graph.

Example 1:
Input:


0 1 2,3,4,
Explanation:

We can clearly see that there are 3 Strongly
Connected Components in the Graph as mentioned
in the Output.
Example 2:
Input:

Output:
0 1 2,
Explanation:
All of the nodes are connected to each other.
So, there's only one SCC as shown.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function tarjans() which takes the number of vertices V and adjacency list of the graph as input parameters and returns a list of list of integers denoting the members of strongly connected components in the given graph.
Note: A single strongly connected component must be represented in the form of a list if integers sorted in the ascending order. The resulting list should consist of a list of all SCCs which must be sorted in a way such that a lexicographically smaller list of integers appears first.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V).

Constraints:
1 ≤ V  ≤ 105
1 ≤ E  ≤ 105
0 ≤ u, v ≤ N-1
