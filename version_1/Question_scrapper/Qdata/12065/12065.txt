You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers, and
q
queries to it.
i
-th query is denoted by two integers
li
and
ri
. For each query, you have to find any integer that occurs exactly once in the subarray of
a
from index
li
to index
ri
(a subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array). For example, if
a=[1,1,2,3,2,4]
, then for query
(li=2,ri=6)
the subarray we are interested in is
[1,2,3,2,4]
, and possible answers are
1
,
3
and
4
; for query
(li=1,ri=2)
the subarray we are interested in is
[1,1]
, and there is no such element that occurs exactly once.
Can you answer all of the queries?
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤5⋅105
).
The third line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤5⋅105
).
Then
q
lines follow,
i
-th line containing two integers
li
and
ri
representing
i
-th query (
1≤li≤ri≤n
).
Output
Answer the queries as follows:
If there is no integer such that it occurs in the subarray from index
li
to index
ri
exactly once, print
0
. Otherwise print any such integer.
