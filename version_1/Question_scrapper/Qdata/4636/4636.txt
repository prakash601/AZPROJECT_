Given an array
A
1
,A
2
…A
N
, find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) required to convert all integers in
A to
0.
In one operation, you
choose a non-negative integer
p (
p≥0),
select at most
K indices in the array
A, and
for each selected index
i, replace
A
i
with
A
i
⊕2
p
. Here,
⊕ denotes bitwise XOR.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T - the number of test cases. Then
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N,
K - the size of the array and the maximum number of elements you can select in an operation.
The second line of each test case contains
N integers

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array
0.

Explanation:
Here is one way to achieve
[0,0,0] from
[3,6,10] in
5 operations:
Choose
p=0 and indices
{1}. Now
A becomes
[2,6,10].
Choose
p=1 and indices
{1,2}. Now
A becomes
[0,4,10].
Choose
p=1 and indices
{3}. Now
A becomes
[0,4,8].
Choose
p=2 and indices
{2}. Now
A becomes
[0,0,8].
Choose
p=3 and indices
{3}. Now
A becomes
[0,0,0].
It can be shown that at least
5 operations are required.
