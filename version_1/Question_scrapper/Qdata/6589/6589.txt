Salmon is playing a game!
He is given two integers
N and
K. His goal is to output
K pairs
(x
i
,y
i
). He creates a function
f such that
f(x
i
)=y
i
and
f is undefined for all other values of
x. His pairs must then meet the following conditions:
All
x
i
are distinct.
All
y
i
are distinct.
All
x
i
,y
i
are in the range
[0,2
N
−1] and are integers.
f(f(x
i
)) is defined for all
i.
Let
H(x) be the number of set bits in the binary representation of
x. Then,
H(x
i
)

=H(f(f(x
i
))) for all
i.
Unfortunately, Salmon is unable to solve this. Help Salmon win the game!
If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them. It can be proven that a solution exists for all
N and
K that meet constraints.
Input
The first line input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of testcases
Each of the next
T lines contains two space-separated integers
N and
K respectively.
Output
Output
K lines for each testcase.
The
i-th line of a testcase should contain two space-separated integers:

and
y
i
, following the given constraints.

Explanation
In the answer to the first testcase, there are 7 pairs.
x
i
and
y
i
are all in the range
[0,2
3
−1], which is the range
[0,7]. All values of
x
i
are distinct, and all values of
y
i
are distinct. However, note that some integers appear in both lists. For example, 5 appears both as
x
1
and as
y
4
. This is allowed. For all
x
i
,
f(f(x
i
)) is defined and
H(f(f(x
i
)))

=H(x
i
). For example,
f(f(7))=4.
H(7)=3, but
H(4)=1. Therefore,
H(f(f(7)))

=H(7), as desired.
