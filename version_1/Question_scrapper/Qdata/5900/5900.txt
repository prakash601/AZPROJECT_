Chef Ada loves trees, she thinks that the beauty of a tree is determined by the distance between its center and centroid. If the tree has multiple centers or centroids, then the beauty is the maximum among every possible pair.
As a reward for her delicious dishes (and awesome coding skills), CodeChef is going to give a present to Chef Ada, and of course it must be a tree! But not any tree, we want to give her one with n nodes, and beauty b. Help find such a tree.
Input
The first line of input contains one number T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers n and b, the desired number of vertices and beauty.
Output
For each test case, if no tree satisfies the conditions print "NO" in a new line.
Otherwise, print "YES" in a new line and describe any valid tree. Print n-1 more lines, each with two integers ui, vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n) denoting the indices of the vertices connected by an edge in the tree.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 104
2 ≤ n ≤ 100
0 ≤ b ≤ n-1
Notes
A vertex u is a centroid if after removing u from the tree, the size of any of the resulting connected components is at most n/2.
Lef f(x) be the greatest distance from u to any other vertex of the tree. A vertex u is a center if f(u) ≤ f(v) for any other vertex v.

1 4
Explanation:
Vertex 1 is the center and centroid of the tree.
