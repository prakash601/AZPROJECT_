Nasir and two of his henchmen are planning to attack
N shops of the Qureshi clan. The shops are conveniently lined up, and numbered from
1 to
N. The
i-th shop contains
A
i
kg of coal.
For a given subarray of shops
[A
L
,A
L+1
,…,A
R
], the bitwise and of this subarray is defined to be the bitwise AND of the coal contained in each of the shops, i.e,
A
L
&A
L+1
&…&A
R
.
The damage caused when bombing the
i-th shop is computed to be the maximum bitwise and over all subarrays containing shop
i, and whose size is strictly larger than 1.
For each shop (
1≤i≤N), find the damage caused when Nasir bombs it.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the number of shops.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers, the
i-th of which is
A
i
, representing the amount of coal in the
i-th shop.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N integers
d
1
,d
2
,…,d
n
where
d
i
represents the maximum damage that can be caused if the
i-th shop is to be bombed.
