Arun has an integer
N. His friend likes the number
1, so Arun wants to reduce
N to
1.
To do so, he can perform the following move several times (possibly, zero):
Pick two integers
X and
Y such that
X+Y is even and
X
Y
is a divisor of
N. Then, replace
N by
X
Y
N
Note that at each step,
X
Y
only needs to be a divisor of the current value of
N, and not necessarily a divisor of the integer Arun initially started with.
Find the minimum number of moves Arun needs to reduce
N to
1. If it is not possible to reduce
N to
1 using the given operation, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to reduce
N to
1, or
−1 if it is not possible to do so.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Choose
X=25 and
Y=1.
X+Y=26 is even, and
X
Y
=25 is a divisor of
N=25 so this is a valid choice of
X and
Y. Dividing
N by
X
Y
leaves us with
25
25
=1 and we are done.
Test case
2: It can be shown that no matter which moves are made,
24 cannot be reduced to
1.
