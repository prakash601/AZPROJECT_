You are given a sequence of
16N positive integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
16N
. You may shuffle this sequence in any way you choose, i.e. change it to any one of its permutations. Then, let
x=(a
1
⊕a
2
)⊗(a
3
⊕a
4
)⊗…⊗(a
8N−1
⊕a
8N
),
y=(a
8N+1
⊕a
8N+2
)⊗(a
8N+3
⊕a
8N+4
)⊗…⊗(a
16N−1
⊕a
16N
),
where
⊗ and
⊕ denote bitwise AND and XOR respectively.
Find the maximum possible value of
x−y.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
space-separated integers
1

16N
.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of
x−y.

Explanation:
Since
1⊕1=2⊕2=0 and
1⊕2=3, it is easy to see that we should let
a

=2 and all the remaining elements
a

should be
1.
