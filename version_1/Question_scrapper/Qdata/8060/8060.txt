Mari has three integers
𝑛
,
𝑥
, and
𝑦
.
Call an array
𝑎
of
𝑛
non-negative integers good if it satisfies the following conditions:
𝑎
1
+
𝑎
2
+…+
𝑎
𝑛
=𝑥
, and
𝑎
1
|
𝑎
2
|…|
𝑎
𝑛
=𝑦
, where
|
denotes the bitwise OR operation.
The score of a good array is the value of
𝑎
1
⊕
𝑎
2
⊕…⊕
𝑎
𝑛
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Koxia wants you to find the total bitwise XOR of the scores of all good arrays. If there are no good arrays, output
0
instead.
Input
The first line of input contains three integers
𝑛
,
𝑥
and
𝑦
(
1≤𝑛<
2
40
,
0≤𝑥<
2
60
,
0≤𝑦<
2
20
).
Output
Output a single integer — the total bitwise XOR of the scores of all good arrays.

Note
In the first test case, there are
12
good arrays totally as follows.
[0,2,3]
,
[0,3,2]
,
[2,0,3]
,
[2,3,0]
,
[3,0,2]
and
[3,2,0]
— the score is
0⊕2⊕3=1
;
[1,2,2]
,
[2,1,2]
and
[2,2,1]
— the score is
1⊕2⊕2=1
;
[1,1,3]
,
[1,3,1]
and
[3,1,1]
— the score is
1⊕1⊕3=3
.
Therefore, the total bitwise xor of the scores is
1⊕…⊕1

In the second test case, there are no good sequences. The output should be
0
.
