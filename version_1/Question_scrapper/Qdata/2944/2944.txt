Given a string s of lowercase alphabets and a number k, the task is to print the minimum value of the string after removal of k characters. The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of the count of each distinct character.
  Example 1:
Input: s = abccc, k = 1
Output: 6
Explaination:
We remove c to get the value as 12 + 12 + 22
  Example 2:
Input: s = aabcbcbcabcc, k = 3
Output: 27
 We remove two 'c' and one 'b'. 
Now we get the value as 3+ 3 + 3.

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minValue() which takes s and k as input parameters and returns the minimum possible required value.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N+Klog(P))  where N is the length of string and P is number of distinct alphabets and K number of alphabets to be removed 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
  Constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ |string length| ≤ 100
