Find the minimum integer
K such that sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of all integers from
1 to
K is greater than or equal to
N.
The bits are enumerated from left to right starting from the leftmost set bit i.e. the most significant bit. For example, binary representation of
77 is 1001101. Bits present on
1
st
,
3
rd
,
5
th
and
7
th
positions in the binary representation are
1,0,1,1 respectively. So sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of
77 is
1+0+1+1=3.
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integer
N.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum possible value of
K.

Explanation:
In the first test case, binary representations of
1 and
2 are 1, 10. Sum of bits present on odd positions in the binary representation of
1 and
2 =
1+1 =
2.
In the second test case, the binary representations of integers from
1 to
5 are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101 respectively. So the sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of integers from
1 to
5 are
1,1,1,1,2 respectively which makes a total of
6.
