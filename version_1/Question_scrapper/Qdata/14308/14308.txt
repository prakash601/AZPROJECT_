Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. To transform the original message into encrypted one using key k, one has to replace each letter with a letter which is k positions later in the alphabet (if this takes the position beyond Z, the rest of it is counted from the start of the alphabet). In a more formal way, if letters of the alphabet are enumerated starting with 0, the result of encryption for character x will be (26 is the number of letters in the Latin alphabet).
You are given the original message and the encryption key k. Output the result of encryption.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 25) — the encryption key.
The second line contains the original message — a sequence of uppercase Latin letters ('A'-'Z'). The length of the message is from 1 to 10, inclusive.
Output
Output the result of encryption.
