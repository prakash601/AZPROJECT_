With your help, Heidi has prepared a plan of trap placement and defence. Yet suddenly, the Doctor popped out of the TARDIS and told her that he had spied on the Daleks' preparations, and there is more of them than ever. Desperate times require desperate measures, so Heidi is going to risk meeting with the Daleks and she will consider placing a trap along any Corridor.
This means she needs your help again in calculating
Emax(c)
– the largest
e≤109
such that if we changed the energy requirement of
c
to
e
, then the Daleks might use
c
in their invasion – but this time for all Time Corridors.
Input
First line: number
n
of destinations, number
m
of corridors (
2≤n≤105
,
n−1≤m≤106
). The next
m
lines: destinations
a
,
b
and energy
e
(
1≤a,b≤n
,
a≠b
,
0≤e≤109
).
No pair
{a,b}
will repeat. The graph is guaranteed to be connected. It is not guaranteed that all energy requirements
e
are distinct, or that the minimum spanning tree is unique.
Output
Output
m
lines, each containing one integer:
Emax(ci)
for the
i
-th Corridor
ci
from the input.
