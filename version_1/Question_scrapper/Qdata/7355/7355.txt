You are given an array
A consisting of
N integers. You have to answer
Q queries of the following two types:
1
L
R
(R>L) which asks you to find
gcd(A
L
,lcm(A
L+1
,gcd(A
L+2
,...,((R−L)mod2==1?
gcd(A
R−1
,A
R
):lcm(A
R−1
,A
R
))…))).
2
L
R
(R>L) which asks you to find the same as above but
lcm swapped with
gcd and vice-versa.
Here
lcm(a,b) and
gcd(a,b) denotes the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of two integers
a and
b respectively.
Example: Consider the array
A =
[2,4,8,16,32,64].
Suppose a query is of the form
1
1
6, so it asks you to find:
gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,lcm(16,gcd(32,64))))).
Suppose a query is of the form
2
1
5, so it asks you to find:
lcm(2,gcd(4,lcm(8,gcd(16,32)))).
Note: Since input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains
Q+2 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers,
N and
Q.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Q lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i
th
of these lines contains three space-separated integers
Type
i
,L
i
,R
i
, denoting the type and parameters of the
i
th
query.
Output Format
For each query, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The answer for the first query is
=gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,lcm(16,gcd(32,64)))))
=
gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,lcm(16,32)))) =
gcd(2,lcm(4,gcd(8,32))) =
gcd(2,lcm(4,8)) =
gcd(2,8) =
2.
The answer for the second query is
=lcm(2,gcd(4,lcm(8,gcd(16,32)))) =
lcm(2,gcd(4,lcm(8,16))) =
lcm(2,gcd(4,16)) =
lcm(2,4) =
4.
