Chef is trying to solve a problem having
T test cases, where, for each test case he is given a single integer
N.
Chef has an algorithm which takes exactly
N
2
iterations for a test case with value
N.
The constraints of the problem are as follows:
1≤T≤maxT
1≤N≤maxN
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
sumN.
Given the values
maxT,maxN, and
sumN, determine the maximum number of iterations Chef's algorithm can take for any valid input file satisfying all the constraints.
Formally speaking, find the maximum value of

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single line consisting of three integers
maxT,maxN, and
sumN.
Output Format
For each test case, output the the maximum number of iterations Chef's algorithm can take in any valid test file.
