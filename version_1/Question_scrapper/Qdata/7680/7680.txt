Chef has found an integer array
A of length
N. He defines the beauty of an array as the maximal value of
gcd(A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
)⋅(r−l+1) over all the subsegments
[l,r] of the array
A.
Chef loves to explore, so aside from the beauty of the initial array, he wants to know the beauty of the array after performing each of
Q updates. Each update replaces a subsegment of the array with an arithmetic progression. Updates are cumulative.
Formally, in each update you are given four integers
l,
r,
x, and
y. Then for each
i∈[l,r], you must replace
A
with
x+y(i−l).
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
Q - the length of the array and the number of updates.
The second line contains
N integers - the array
A.
The next
Q lines each contains four integers
l,
r,
x,
y - the description of an update: an arithmetic progression with the initial term
x and the common difference
y on the subsegment
[l,r].
Output Format
For each test case, output
Q+1 lines. In the first line for each test case output the beauty of the initial array, in the
i-th (
2≤i≤Q+1) line for each test case output the beauty of the array after performing
i−1 changes.

Explanation:
After the first operation
A=[2,6,4,12,18,12]. The maximum value is reached on the segment
[4,6].
After the second operation
A=[2,2,6,10,14,12]. The maximum value is reached on the segment
[5,5].
