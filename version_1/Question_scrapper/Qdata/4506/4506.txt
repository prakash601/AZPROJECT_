You are given a binary string
S of length
N. Your task is to check if there exists a substring of
S which is the binary representation of a prime number.
Formally, check if there exist integers
L and
R such that
1≤L≤R≤N, and the substring
S
L
S
L+1
S
L+2
…S
R
, when treated as a binary integer, is prime.
Print "Yes" if such a substring exists, and "No" if it doesn't.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each testcase consists of a single line of input, containing a binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one string — "Yes" or "No", the answer to the problem.
You may print each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one substring, namely "1", and it isn't prime.
Test case
2: The substrings of the given string are
{"1", "11", "111", "1", "11", "1"
}. Of these, "111" which represents
7 in binary, and "11" which represents
3 in binary, are primes.
Test case
3: One of the substrings of the string is "1101", which is the binary representation of
13 — a prime.
