You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
non-negative integers.
The numbness of a subarray
al,al+1,…,ar
(for arbitrary
l≤r
) is defined as
max(al,al+1,…,ar)⊕(al⊕al+1⊕…⊕ar),
where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Find the maximum numbness over all subarrays.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum numbness over all subarrays of the given array.

Note
For the first test case, for the subarray
[3,4,5]
, its maximum value is
5
. Hence, its numbness is
3⊕4⊕5⊕5
=
7
. This is the maximum possible numbness in this array.
In the second test case the subarray
[47,52]
provides the maximum numbness.
