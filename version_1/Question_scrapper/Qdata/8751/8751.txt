You are given
n
distinct points on a plane. The coordinates of the
i
-th point are
(xi,yi)
.
For each point
i
, find the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point with integer coordinates that is not among the given
n
points. If there are multiple such points — you can choose any of them.
The Manhattan distance between two points
(x1,y1)
and
(x2,y2)
is
|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of points in the set.
The next
n
lines describe points. The
i
-th of them contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi,yi≤2⋅105
) — coordinates of the
i
-th point.
It is guaranteed that all points in the input are distinct.
Output
Print
n
lines. In the
i
-th line, print the point with integer coordinates that is not among the given
n
points and is the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) to the
i
-th point from the input.
Output coordinates should be in range
[−106;106]
. It can be shown that any optimal answer meets these constraints.
If there are several answers, you can print any of them.
