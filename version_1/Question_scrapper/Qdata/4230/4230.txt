Given a binary number (of $N$ bits) $X$. Find the highest power of 2 that divides this number.
Note: If the binary number is "100" then the highest power of 2 that divides it is 2 (as $2^2$ = 4)
Input:
The first line contains N the number of bits in the number
The next line contains a binary number of N bits
Output:
The first and only line contains the max power of 2 that divides the given number
Constraints:
$1 \leq N \leq10^5$
$1\leq X$
