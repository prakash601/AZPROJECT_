A disease is spreading through ChefLand!
The disease spreads as follows:
At the end of day
0, a single person is infected with the disease.
During the next
10 days, the number of infected people doubles each day, until the disease has spread to all people in ChefLand.
From day
11 onwards, the number of infected people triples each day, until the disease has spread to all people in ChefLand.
You are given the population of ChefLand
N and a day
D. How many people in ChefLand are infected at the end of day
D?
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers
N and
D — the population of ChefLand and the day for which you need to find the number of infected people, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print one line containing a single integer — the number of infected people in ChefLand at the end of day
D.

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
At the end of day
1, the number of infected people is
2×1=2.
At the end of day
2, the number of infected people is
2×2=4.
At the end of day
3, the number of infected people is
2×4=8.
Test Case 2: Following the rules in the statement, it can be seen that at the end of day
10, the total number of infected people is
1024.
Test Case 3: Note that starting at day
11, the number of infected people triples each day,
3×1024=3072.
Test Case 4: At the end of day
3, the number of infected people is
8. Since there are only
10 people in ChefLand (which is less than
2×8=16), at the end of day
4 all people in ChefLand are infected and thus the number of infected people is
10 for all days from day
4 onwards, including day
11.
