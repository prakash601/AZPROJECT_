JJ gives Chef a number
X and challenges Chef to come up with three distinct numbers
A,
B, and
C such that:
0≤A,B,C<2
30
;
(A⊕B)+(B⊕C)+(C⊕A)=X.
Help Chef come up with three such numbers or determine that no such tuple exists.
Here,
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
- the number mentioned in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output three distinct numbers
A,
B and
C
(0≤A,B,C<2
30
) such that
(A⊕B)+(B⊕C)+(C⊕A)=X.
If multiple such tuples exist, print any. If no such tuple exists, print
−1.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤X<2
30

Explanation:
Test Case
1:
A=0,B=1,C=3 is a valid answer because
(0⊕1)+(1⊕3)+(3⊕0)=1+2+3=6.
Test Case
2: It can be proven that no tuple exists that satisfies the given conditions.
Test Case
3:
A=3,B=11,C=1 is a valid answer because
(3⊕11)+(11⊕1)+(1⊕3)=8+10+2=20.
