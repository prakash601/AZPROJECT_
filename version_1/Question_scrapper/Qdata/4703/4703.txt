Princess Artapoelc greeted her guests by either kissing on the cheek (K) or hugging (H). From the first guest
she kisses, she has a compulsion to necessarily kiss every alternate guest from that first kissed guest. That is if the guests are G1,
G2, ..., Gi, Gi+1, ..., Gn and if she first kissed Gi then she must necessarily kiss
Gi+2, Gi+4, Gi+6 ... till the last possible guest. Your task is to determine in how many ways she can greet N guests.
