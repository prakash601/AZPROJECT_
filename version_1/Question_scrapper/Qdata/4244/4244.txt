You are given an integer
N. Your task is to generate a permutation
P of size
N, such that:
For all
(1<i≤N),
∑
j=1
i
P
j
is not divisible by
i.
In other words, the sum of prefix of length
i
(i>1) should not be divisible by
i.
In case multiple such permutations exist, print any. If no such permutation exists, print
−1 instead.
Note that a permutation of size
N contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists a single integer
N — the size of the permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line,
N space separated integers, denoting the required permutation.
In case multiple such permutations exist, print any. If no such permutation exists, print
−1 instead.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: A possible permutation satisfying the given conditions is
P=[3,4,1,2].
For
i=2: The prefix sum is
3+4=7, which is not divisible by
2.
For
i=3: The prefix sum is
3+4+1=8, which is not divisible by
3.
For
i=4: The prefix sum is
3+4+1+2=10, which is not divisible by
4.
Test case
2: A possible permutation satisfying the given conditions is
P=[1,2,4,6,3,5].
For
i=2: The prefix sum is
1+2=3, which is not divisible by
2.
For
i=3: The prefix sum is
1+2+4=7, which is not divisible by
3.
For
i=4: The prefix sum is
1+2+4+6=13, which is not divisible by
4.
For
i=5: The prefix sum is
1+2+4+6+3=16, which is not divisible by
5.
For
i=6: The prefix sum is
1+2+4+6+3+5=21, which is not divisible by
6.
Test case
3: It can be proven that no permutation of length
7 satisfies the given conditions.
