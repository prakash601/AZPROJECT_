You are given a string
S containing only decimal digits ('0' through '9') and a number
N. Your task is to insert an arbitrary number (including zero) of plus signs '+' into
S in order to form a valid expression whose value is equal to
N.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string
S, followed by a space and an integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string — your solution, i.e. the expression obtained after inserting some plus signs into
S. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.
Constraints
T≤5
1≤∣S∣≤120
N<=int(S). Notes:
int(S) is the integer value of
S, if we consider
S as an integer.

Example Input
4
15112 28
120012 33
123 123
15489001 10549
Example Output
15+11+2
1+20+012
123
1548+9001
Explanation
Example case 1:
S is "15112" and
N=28. We can put a plus sign before the third character and another plus sign before the last character of this string to form the expression
15+11+2, which is equal to
28.
