Find the sum of all the numbers between the range l and r. Here each number is represented by the sum of its distinct prime factors. 
Note: For example, 6 is represented by 5 because 6 has two prime factors 2 and 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.

Example 1:
Input: l = 1, r = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 1->0, 2->2 and 0+2=2.
1 has no prime factors.

Example 2:
Input: l = 1, r = 6
17
: 1->0, 2->2, 3->3, 4->2
5->5, 6->2+3=5, 0+2+3+2+5+5 = 17.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function sumOfAll() which takes l and r as input parameter and returns sum all the numbers ( as represented ) in the given range both L and R included.

Expected Time Complexity: O(nloglogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= l <= r <=104
