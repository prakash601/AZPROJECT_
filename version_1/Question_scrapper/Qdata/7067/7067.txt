Roger loves drawing polygons. For an arbitrary sequence of points in a 2D plane
P
0
,P
1
,…,P
M−1
, he can draw a polygon with
M sides by connecting the points
P
i
and
P
(i+1)%M
with a straight line segment for each valid
i. As a result, any point forms a polygon with
M=1, any two distinct points also form a polygon with
M=2 and a polygon may have sides with length
0.
Roger calls a multiset
S of
M integers polygonable if there is a polygon created from a sequence with size
M (as defined above) such that the multiset of its side lengths is equal to
S. For example, the multisets
(0,0),
(1,3,3) or
(9,9) are all polygonable, but
(4) and
(2,5,8) are not.
Roger has a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N), where each edge is coloured in one of
K colours (numbered
1 through
N). He wants to pick an unordered pair of distinct vertices in the tree and create a multiset
S=(S
1
,S
2
,…,S
K
), where
S
i
is the number of edges on the path between the chosen vertices which have colour
i. Now, Roger is wondering: in how many ways can he pick a pair of vertices such that the resulting multiset
S is polygonable? Find the number of such pairs.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers
v,
u and
c, denoting an edge with colour
c between vertices
v and
u.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
