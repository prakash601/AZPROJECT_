Imi has an undirected tree with
𝑛
vertices where edges are numbered from
1
to
𝑛−1
. The
𝑖
-th edge connects vertices
𝑢
𝑖
and
𝑣
𝑖
. There are also
𝑘
butterflies on the tree. Initially, the
𝑖
-th butterfly is on vertex
𝑎
𝑖
. All values of
𝑎
are pairwise distinct.
Koxia plays a game as follows:
For
𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛−1
, Koxia set the direction of the
𝑖
-th edge as
𝑢
𝑖
→
𝑣
𝑖
or
𝑣
𝑖
→
𝑢
𝑖
with equal probability.
For
𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛−1
, if a butterfly is on the initial vertex of
𝑖
-th edge and there is no butterfly on the terminal vertex, then this butterfly flies to the terminal vertex. Note that operations are sequentially in order of
1,2,…,𝑛−1
instead of simultaneously.
Koxia chooses two butterflies from the
𝑘
butterflies with equal probability from all possible
𝑘(𝑘−1)
2
ways to select two butterflies, then she takes the distance
†
between the two chosen vertices as her score.
Now, Koxia wants you to find the expected value of her score, modulo
998244
353
‡
.
†
The distance between two vertices on a tree is the number of edges on the (unique) simple path between them.
‡
Formally, let
𝑀=998244353
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
𝑝
𝑞
, where
𝑝
and
𝑞
are integers and
𝑞≢0(mod𝑀)
. Output the integer equal to
𝑝⋅
𝑞
−1
mod𝑀
. In other words, output such an integer
𝑥
that
0≤𝑥<𝑀
and
𝑥⋅𝑞≡𝑝(mod𝑀)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
𝑛
,
𝑘
(
2≤𝑘≤𝑛≤3⋅
10
5
) — the size of the tree and the number of butterflies.
The second line contains
𝑘
integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑘
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤𝑛
) — the initial position of butterflies. It's guaranteed that all positions are distinct.
The
𝑖
-th line in following
𝑛−1
lines contains two integers
𝑢
𝑖
,
𝑣
𝑖
(
1≤
𝑢
𝑖
,
𝑣
𝑖
≤𝑛
,
𝑢
𝑖
≠
𝑣
𝑖
) — the vertices the
𝑖
-th edge connects.
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
Output
Output a single integer — the expected value of Koxia's score, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, the tree is shown below. Vertices containing butterflies are noted as bold.
There are only
2
butterflies so the choice of butterflies is fixed. Let's consider the following
4
cases:
Edges are
1→2
and
2→3
: butterfly on vertex
1
moves to vertex
2
, but butterfly on vertex
3
doesn't move. The distance between vertices
2
and
3
is
1
.
Edges are
1→2
and
3→2
: butterfly on vertex
1
moves to vertex
2
, but butterfly on vertex
3
can't move to vertex
2
because it's occupied. The distance between vertices
2
and
3
is
1
.
Edges are
2→1
and
2→3
: butterflies on both vertex
1
and vertex
3
don't move. The distance between vertices
1
and
3
is
2
.
Edges are
2→1
and
3→2
: butterfly on vertex
1
doesn't move, but butterfly on vertex
3
move to vertex
2
. The distance between vertices
1
and
2
is
1
.
Therefore, the expected value of Koxia's score is
1+1+2+1
4
=
5
4
, which is
748683266
after modulo
998244353
.
In the second test case, the tree is shown below. Vertices containing butterflies are noted as bold. The expected value of Koxia's score is
11

, which is
831870296
after modulo
998244353
.
