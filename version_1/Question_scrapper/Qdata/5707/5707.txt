You are an evil sorcerer at a round table with
N sorcerers (including yourself). You can cast
M spells which have distinct powers
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
M
.
You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Assign a living sorcerer to each positive integer cyclically to your left starting from yourself ― the closest living sorcerer to your left is assigned to
1, the next living sorcerer to the left is assigned to
2 and so on. Note that each living sorcerer (including yourself) is assigned to an infinite number of integers.
Choose a spell
j (possibly a spell you have chosen before) and kill the living sorcerer assigned to
p
j
. You may not cast a spell to kill yourself.
What is the maximum number of sorcerers you can kill using zero or more operations?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
The second line contains
M space-separated integers
p

,p

.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of sorcerers you can kill.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The initial state is shown in the figure from the statement. We can first use spell
1 and kill the
5-th sorcerer to our left, i.e. sorcerer
2. Now there are
3 living sorcerers and the state is as shown in the following figure:
We can use spell
1 again and kill the current
5-th living sorcerer to our left, i.e. sorcerer
4. Now there are
2 living sorcerers and the state is:
Finally, we can use spell
1 again and kill the only other living sorcerer, i.e. sorcerer
3. Now, none of the other sorcerers are alive. As we cannot cast a spell to kill ourselves, we cannot improve the answer any further.
Example case 2: We can perform
4 operations using the spell
p
1
=2 each time. We can also instead use
p
2
=4 in the first two operations and
p
1
=2 in the last two operations. Note that there may be multiple valid sequences of operations that lead to the best answer.
Example case 3: We cannot perform any operations using any of the given spells, so we are unable to kill any sorcerers.
Example case 4: We can perform
1,755,647 operations, each of them using the spell
p
