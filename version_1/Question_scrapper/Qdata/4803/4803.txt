This is an interactive problem.
Chef has a secret integer. The only information you have is that it has an odd number of factors and that it lies between
1 and
10
6
inclusive.
You have been challenged by Chef to find his number. You may make up to
2,000 guesses (queries). Whenever you guess Chef's number, he only tells you if you guessed correctly or not. Can you find Chef's number?
Interaction
First, you should read a line containing a single integer
T ― the number of test cases. The description of interaction for
T test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by asking queries.
To ask a query, you should print a line containing an integer between
1 and
10
6
inclusive ― your guess.
Then, you should read a line containing a single integer:
1 if you correctly guessed Chef's secret number,
0 if your guess was incorrect or
−1 if your guess is invalid (in particular, smaller than
1 or greater than
10
6
) or you have asked more than
2,000 queries.
As soon as you have correctly guessed Chef's secret number, you should stop asking queries and continue solving the remaining test cases.
If you read
−1, you must immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line! You can read more about interactive problems here.
