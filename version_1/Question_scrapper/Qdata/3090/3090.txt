Given an array A of size N, the task is to check if the given array represents a Binary Max Heap.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = {90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2}
Output: True
The given array represents below tree
 90
 / \
 15 10
 / \ /
7 12 2
The tree follows max-heap property as every
node is greater than all of its descendants.

Example 2:
Input: arr[] = {9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11}
Output: False
The given array represents below tree
 9
 / \
 15 10
 / \ /
7 12 11
The tree doesn't follows max-heap property 9 is
smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11.
  Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isMaxHeap() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns  "1", else print "0" (without quotes).

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1015
