Suzumo is the coach of the ChefLand OI team. Physical condition is very important in any olympiad, so he wants to make the children run a bit as a warmup.
The team consists of
N children numbered
1 through
N standing at some positions on the
x-axis. For each valid
i, the initial
x-coordinate of the
i-th kid is
x
i
, the running velocity of the
i-th kid is constant and equal to
v
i
.
Suzumo wants to assign a running direction (left or right, i.e. in the direction of decreasing or increasing
x-coordinate) to each kid; the children start running at time
0 in the assigned directions. Afterwards, Suzumo will measure the smallest time
t at which some kid passes another one. Help Suzumo compute the maximum time
t if he can assign the directions arbitrarily!
Note: Child
i passes child
j at time
t
ij
if their coordinates satisfy
x
i
<x
j
at any time
t<t
ij
and
x
i
>x
j
at any time
t>t
ij
, or if they satisfy
x
i
>x
j
at any time
t<t
ij
and
x
i
<x
j
at any time
t>t
ij
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
and
v
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the maximum possible time
t, or
−1 if it is possible to assign directions in such a way that no kid ever passes another. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error less than or equal to
