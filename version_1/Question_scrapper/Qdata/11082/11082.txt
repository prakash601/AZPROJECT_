For years, the Day of city N was held in the most rainy day of summer. New mayor decided to break this tradition and select a not-so-rainy day for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the
n
days of summer. On the
i
-th day,
ai
millimeters of rain will fall. All values
ai
are distinct.
The mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather
x
days before the celebration and
y
days after. Because of that, he says that a day
d
is not-so-rainy if
ad
is smaller than rain amounts at each of
x
days before day
d
and and each of
y
days after day
d
. In other words,
ad<aj
should hold for all
d−x≤j<d
and
d<j≤d+y
. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such
j
that
1≤j≤n
.
Help mayor find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
x
and
y
(
1≤n≤100000
,
0≤x,y≤7
) — the number of days in summer, the number of days citizens watch the weather before the celebration and the number of days they do that after.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
a1
,
a2
, ...,
an
(
1≤ai≤109
), where
ai
denotes the rain amount on the
i
-th day.
Output
Print a single integer — the index of the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer. We can show that the answer always exists.

Note
In the first example days
3
and
8
are not-so-rainy. The
3
-rd day is earlier.
In the second example day
3
is not not-so-rainy, because
3+y=6
and
a3>a6
. Thus, day
8
is the answer. Note that
8+y=11
, but we don't consider day
11
, because it is not summer.
