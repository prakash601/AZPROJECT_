Chef played an interesting game yesterday. This game is played with two variables
X and
Y; initially,
X=Y=0. Chef may make an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). In each move, he must perform the following process:
Choose any positive integer
P such that
P⋅P>Y.
Change
X to
P.
Add
P⋅P to
Y.
Unfortunately, Chef has a bad memory and he has forgotten the moves he made. He only remembers the value of
X after the game finished; let's denote it by
X
f
. Can you tell him the maximum possible number of moves he could have made in the game?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
X
f
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of moves Chef could have made.
