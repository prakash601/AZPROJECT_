Given an array of penalties fine[], an array of car numbers car[], and also the date. The task is to find the total fine which will be collected on the given date. Fine is collected from odd-numbered cars on even dates and vice versa.
  Example 1:
Input:
N = 4, date = 12
car[] = {2375, 7682, 2325, 2352}
fine[] = {250, 500, 350, 200}
Output:
600
Explantion:
The date is 12 (even), so we collect the
fine from odd numbered cars. The odd
numbered cars and the fines associated
with them are as follows:
2375 -> 250
2325 -> 350
The sum of the fines is 250+350 = 600
  Example 2:
Input:
N = 3, date = 8
car[] = {2222, 2223, 2224}
fine[] = {200, 300, 400}
Output:
300


Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function totalFine() which takes the array car[] and fine[] its size N and an integer date as inputs and returns the total fine.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Cari <= 105
1 <= Date <= 105
1 <= Finei <= 105
