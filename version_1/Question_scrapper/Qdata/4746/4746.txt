You are given a positive integer
N.
Consider an array
A of length
N. Let
P
i
denote the sum of the first
i elements of
A and
S
i
denote the sum of the last
i elements of
A.
You need to construct the array
A of size
N such that all of the following conditions are met:
−10
9
≤A
i
≤10
9
, for all
(1≤i≤N)
P
i
>S
i
if
i is odd, for each
(1≤i<N)
P
i
<S
i
if
i is even, for each
(1≤i<N)
If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.
If there is no such array, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
T.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
N, where
N is the length of the required array.
Output Format
For each test case, if a valid array exists, print
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
satisfying all the given conditions.
If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.
If there is no such array, print
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All elements are in the given range for the array
A=[343,−343].
For
i=1: Since
i is odd,
P
1
=343 is greater than
S
1
=−343.
Test case
2: It can be proved that no array of length
3 exists satisfying all conditions.
Test case
3: All elements are in the given range for the array
A=[0,−5,343,−100].
For
i=1: Since
i is odd,
P
1
=0 is greater than
S
1
=−100.
For
i=2: Since
i is even,
P
2
=0+(−5)=−5 is less than
S
2
=343+(−100)=243.
For
i=3: Since
i is odd,
P
3
=0+(−5)+343=338 is greater than
S
3
=(−5)+343+(−100)=238.
