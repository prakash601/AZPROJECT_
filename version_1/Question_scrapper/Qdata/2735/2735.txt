Given an array of integers, your task is to find the smallest and second smallest element in the array. If smallest and second smallest do not exist, print -1.
Example 1:
Input :
5
2 4 3 5 6
Output :
2 3 
Explanation: 
2 and 3 are respectively the smallest 
and second smallest elements in the array.

Example 2:
6
1 2 1 3 6 7
Output :
1 2 
Explanation: 
1 and 2 are respectively the smallest 
and second smallest elements in the array.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minAnd2ndMin() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns a vector containing the smallest and second smallest element if possible, else return {-1,-1}.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1<=N<=105
1<=A[i]<=105
