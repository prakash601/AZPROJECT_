Chef has a permutation
P of length
N consisting of integers
0 to
N−1.
Help Chef answer
Q queries of the following kind:
Given integers
L
1
,L
2
,M
1
, and
M
2
, compute the number of subsegments of
P having length in the range
[L
1
,L
2
] (both inclusive) and MEX in the range
[M
1
,M
2
] (both inclusive).
Note:
The permutation
P consists of all integers from
0 to
N−1 exactly once.
A sequence of integers
S is said to be a subsegment of
P if it can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) elements from the left of
P and several (possibly zero) elements from the right of
P. In particular,
P is a subsegment of
P while
[] is not a subsegment of
P.
The MEX of a sequence of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to it.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q — the size of the permutation and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
, the permutation
P.
Each of the next
Q lines will contain a query denoted by four space separated integers
L
1
,L
2
,M
1
, and
M
2
, as defined in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output
Q lines, where the
i
th
line denotes the answer to the
i
th
query.
