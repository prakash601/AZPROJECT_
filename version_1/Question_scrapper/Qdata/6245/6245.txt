You are given a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You may choose an arbitrary permutation
p
1
,p
2
,…,p
N
of the integers
1 through
N. Then, for each vertex
i, you should assign the value
A
p
i
to this vertex.
The profit of a path between two vertices
u and
v is the sum of the values assigned to the vertices on that path (including
u and
v).
Let's consider only (undirected) paths that start at a leaf and end at a different leaf. Calculate the maximum possible value of the sum of profits of all such paths. Since this value could be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A

N
.
Each of the following
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that vertices
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of profits, modulo
10

+7.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
(1,4,2,3) is one of the possible permutations that give the optimal answer. Then, the profits of paths between pairs of vertices
(1,3),
(1,4) and
(3,4) are
7,
8 and
9 respectively.
Example case 2: Here, any permutation could be chosen.
