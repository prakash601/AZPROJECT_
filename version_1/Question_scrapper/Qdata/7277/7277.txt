Madoka was given a tree on her coming of age, and not a simple one, but a rooted tree of
n vertices with a root at the vertex with the number
1.
For all
i≥2, let
P
i
(
1≤P
i
≤i−1) be the parent of the vertex
i.
Let's define the depth array
h as follows:
h
1
=1, and
h
i
=h
P
i
+1 for all
i≥2.
The subtree of a vertex
u, denoted
S(u), is defined as the set of vertices
v such that the unique path from
1 to
v contains
u. Also, we define
val
u
=max{h(v):v∈S(u)}.
A tree is divided into paths by a ladder decomposition if each vertex is located on exactly one path, and each vertex
u with at least one child lies in the same path as its child
v with the maximum
val
v
, and if there are several such vertices, then the vertex with the minimum number is selected.
Madoka defines the beauty of a tree in the following way. Let the ladder decomposition of the path lengths be
L
1
,…,L
k
, then the beauty of the tree is
L
1
2
+L
2
2
+⋯+L
k
2
For each
i (
1≤i≤n), your task is to calculate the beauty of the tree formed by the first
i vertices.
Input
The first line contains an integer
T - the number of test cases. Then
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n - the size of the tree.
The second line contains
n−1 integers
P
2
,…,P
n
.
Output
For each test case, print in a separate line a single integer - the answer to the problem.
