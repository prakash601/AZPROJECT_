Ujan is a software developer. He is developing a software that takes two integers
L and
R and outputs the count of integers in the sequence
L,L+1,…,R−1,R whose sum of digits (SOD) is divisible by
3.
He has developed the user interface (UI) quite easily. He is having a hard time finding the logic to solve the problem. As you are not only a good friend of Ujan but also a good problem solver, he asks you to help him out.
Can you solve the problem for your friend, Ujan?
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integer
L,R.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer equal to the count of of integers in the sequence, whose sum of digits is divisible by
3 .

Explanation:
Test case 1: The numbers are
139,
140 and
141. Their sum of digits is
13,
5 and
6 respectively. So, only
141 is the number that has its sum of digits divisible by
3.
