You are given an array
a
of
n
integers. You are allowed to perform the following operation on it as many times as you want (0 or more times):
Choose
2
indices
i
,
j
where
1≤i<j≤n
and replace
ak
for all
i≤k≤j
with
|ai−aj|
Print the maximum sum of all the elements of the final array that you can obtain in such a way.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of array
a
.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print the sum of the final array.

Note
In the first test case, it is not possible to achieve a sum
>3
by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum is
3
.
In the second test case, it can be shown that the maximum sum achievable is
16
. By using operation
(1,2)
we transform the array from
[9,1]
into
[8,8]
, thus the sum of the final array is
16
.
In the third test case, it can be shown that it is not possible to achieve a sum
>18
by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum is
18
.
