There are
N planets numbered
1 to
N. You are a space merchant who earns by selling goods on these planets. Traveling to each planet requires you to pay for the fuel. The difficulty of traveling to
i-th planet is
D
i
. You need to plan your trip by choosing a consecutive sub segment of planets.
Your earning of the trip is calculated as follows -
You earn
A coins for every planet you visit.
For each planet
i you visit, you have to pay
C
i
coins for the fuel.
If you visit every planet with indices
L to
R, you also have to pay
gap(L,R) coins where
gap(L,R)=max[(D
r
−D
l
)
2
]
forL<=l<=r<=R
Calculate the maximum profit you can earn by traveling to a consecutive segment of planets. Note that if you travel to no planet at all, your net profit will be zero.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
For each testcase, the first line contains two integers
N and
A
The next
N lines contains two integers
C
i
,D
i
###Output: For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.

###Sample Input:
1 3 10 1 3 3 1 2 2
###Sample Output: 20
###EXPLANATION: For L = 1 and R = 3, we have profit = (3 - 1 + 1) * 10 - (1 + 3 + 2) - (3 - 1)*(3 - 1) = 20. This is the maximum possible profit for any sub-segment.
