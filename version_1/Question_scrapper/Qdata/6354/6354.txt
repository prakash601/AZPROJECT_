You are given two integers
N and
K.
Construct an array
A consisting of
N distinct positive integers such that the following conditions are met:
1≤A
i
≤2⋅10
4
;
There exists no subsequence of
A with sum
K.
It can be shown that the answer always exists.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T: the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K - as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated elements:
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. If there are multiple answers, you may print any.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1:
A=[1,2,5,6]. All elements of the array are distinct. Also,
1≤A
i
≤2⋅10
4
, and there isn't any subsequence of the array with sum
10.
Some other valid answers are:
[2,6,5,1] and
[3,27,869,541].
Test case
2:
A=[327,8695,4,19852,14,736,46,15,37,928]. All elements of the array are distinct. Also,
1≤A
i
≤2⋅10
4
, and there isn't any subsequence of the array with sum
1000000.
