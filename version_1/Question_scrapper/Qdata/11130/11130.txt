Consider a sequence of digits of length
2k
[a1,a2,…,a2k]
. We perform the following operation with it: replace pairs
(a2i+1,a2i+2)
with
(a2i+1+a2i+2)mod10
for
0≤i<2k−1
. For every
i
where
a2i+1+a2i+2≥10
we get a candy! As a result, we will get a sequence of length
2k−1
.
Less formally, we partition sequence of length
2k
into
2k−1
pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth
…
, the last pair consists of the (
2k−1
)-th and (
2k
)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least
10
, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by
10
(and don't change the order of the numbers).
Perform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length
1
. Let
f([a1,a2,…,a2k])
denote the number of candies we get in this process.
For example: if the starting sequence is
[8,7,3,1,7,0,9,4]
then:
After the first operation the sequence becomes
[(8+7)mod10,(3+1)mod10,(7+0)mod10,(9+4)mod10]
=
[5,4,7,3]
, and we get
2
candies as
8+7≥10
and
9+4≥10
.
After the second operation the sequence becomes
[(5+4)mod10,(7+3)mod10]
=
[9,0]
, and we get one more candy as
7+3≥10
.
After the final operation sequence becomes
[(9+0)mod10]
=
[9]
.
Therefore,
f([8,7,3,1,7,0,9,4])=3
as we got
3
candies in total.
You are given a sequence of digits of length
n
s1,s2,…sn
. You have to answer
q
queries of the form
(li,ri)
, where for
i
-th query you have to output
f([sli,sli+1,…,sri])
. It is guaranteed that
ri−li+1
is of form
2k
for some nonnegative integer
k
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the sequence.
The second line contains
n
digits
s1,s2,…,sn
(
0≤si≤9
).
The third line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤105
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
li
,
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
) —
i
-th query. It is guaranteed that
ri−li+1
is a nonnegative integer power of
2
.
Output
Output
q
lines, in
i
-th line output single integer —
f([sli,sli+1,…,sri])
, answer to the
i
-th query.

Note
The first example illustrates an example from the statement.
f([7,3,1,7])=1
: sequence of operations is
[7,3,1,7]→[(7+3)mod10,(1+7)mod10]
=
[0,8]
and one candy as
7+3≥10
→
[(0+8)mod10]
=
[8]
, so we get only
1
candy.
f([9])=0
as we don't perform operations with it.
