Given a dictionary of words and a pattern. Every character in the pattern is uniquely mapped to a character in the dictionary. Find all such words in the dictionary that match the given pattern. 
Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
dict[] = {abb,abc,xyz,xyy}
pattern = foo
Output: abb xyy
Explanation: xyy and abb have the same
character at index 1 and 2 like the
pattern.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMatchedWords() which takes an array of strings dict[] consisting of the words in the dictionary and a string, Pattern and returns an array of strings consisting of all the words in the dict[] that match the given Pattern in lexicographical order.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*K) (where K is the length of the pattern).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10
