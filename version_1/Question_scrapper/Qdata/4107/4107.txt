From an array
A containing
N integers, you construct a binary string
S of length
(N−1) as follows. For all
1≤i<N:
If
A
i
<A
i+1
, then
S
i
=0.
If
A
i
>A
i+1
, then
S
i
=1.
Given the string
S, determine the count of indices
i
(1≤i≤N) such that it is possible for
A
i
to be the maximum element of the array
A.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string
S of length
(N−1) containing
0s and
1s only.
Output Format
For each test case, output the count of indices
i
(1≤i≤N) such that it is possible for
A
i
to be the maximum element of the array
A.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Here
A
1
<A
2
. Therefore clearly only
A
2
can be the maximum element of
A.
Test case
2: Here
A
1
<A
2
,
A

<A
4
,
A

>A
5
,
A
5
>A
6
and
A
6
>A
7
. Therefore, clearly only
A
4
can be the maximum element of
A.
Test case
3: Here
A
1
>A
2
,
A

>A
3
,
A
3
>A
4
,
A
4
<A
5
and
A
5
<A
6
. Therefore
A
1
and
A
6
both can be the maximum elements of
A.
