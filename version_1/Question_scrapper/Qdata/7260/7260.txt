For a non-negative integer
X, the function
G(X) is defined as the greatest common divisor of all the integers generated by all submasks of the binary representation of
X, i.e. integers obtained by replacing some (possibly none or all)
1-s in this binary representation by
0-s.
You are given an integer
N. Find
S=∑
X=1
N

G(X)
modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
S modulo
998,244,353.
