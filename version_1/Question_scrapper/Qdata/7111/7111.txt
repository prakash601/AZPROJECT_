Pantelija was given a sequence of positive integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
. Let's define the gcd value of this sequence as the number of its non-empty contiguous subsequences with greatest common divisor strictly greater than
1. The greatest common divisor of any contiguous subsequence
a
l
,a
l+1
,…,a
r
(
1≤l≤r≤N) is the greatest positive integer which divides each element of this subsequence.
Pantelija wants to maximise the gcd value of this sequence. In order to do that, he may choose a valid index
i, an integer
b (
1≤b≤5⋅10
5
, since he does not like large numbers) and change the element
a
i
to
b. What is the maximum possible gcd value he can obtain?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a

.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the largest possible gcd value.
