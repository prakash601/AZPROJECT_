Chef has the
N numbers
1,2,3,…,N. He wants to give exactly
K of these numbers to his friend and keep the rest with him.
He can choose any
K numbers such that the GCD of any number from Chef's set and any number from his friend's set is equal to
1.
Formally, suppose Chef gives the set of numbers
A to his friend and keeps
B with himself (where
∣A∣=K and
∣B∣=N−K). Then
A and
B must satisfy
gcd
gcd(a,b)=1  ∀a∈A,b∈B
Chef needs your help in choosing these
K numbers. Please find any valid set of
K numbers that will satisfy the condition, or tell him that no such set exists.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Output Format
For each test case first output a single line containing "YES" (without quotes) if a set of size
K satisfying Chef's condition exists; and "NO" if no such set exists. This line is not case-sensitive so "YeS", "nO", etc. are also acceptable.
Next, if the answer is "YES", print another line containing
K distinct space-separated integers from
1 to
N denoting the numbers which Chef will give to his friend. The integers can be printed in any order.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can give
[3] to his friend and keep
[1,2,4] for himself.
3 is coprime with
1,2 and
4 so the condition is satisfied. Another possible solution is Chef giving
[1] to his friend.
Test case
2: Chef can give
[2,4] and keep
[1,3] (or vice versa). It can be seen that
gcd(2,1)=1,
gcd(2,3)=1,
gcd(4,1)=1,
gcd(4,3)=1 and so the condition is satisfied.
Test case
3: There is no set of 3 numbers that can satisfy the given condition.
