You are given
N strings
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
N
. Consider a complete undirected graph with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N), in which the weight of an edge between vertices
u and
v is equal to the length of the longest common substring of
S
u
and
S
v
.
Find the maximum possible weight of a spanning tree of this graph.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains a single string
S
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the maximum weight of a spanning tree.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
for each valid
i,
S
i
contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅10

Explanation:
Example case 1: The strings
S
2
,S
3
have a longest common substring with length
2, and the strings
S
1
,S
3
have a longest common substring with length
2. The spanning tree which contains the edges
(2,3) and
(1,3) has the maximum weight
