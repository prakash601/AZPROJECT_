Krillin has died yet again. Goku and Picollo must find a dragon ball in order to resurrect him. Kami gives them a quiz to solve in return for the dragon ball.
He gives them an array
A (having 1 based indexing) of
N integers and he'll ask them
Q queries. The array is basically a frequency table which represents some data. It signifies that
i occurs
A[i] times in the data. The queries can be of two types -
1
L
R
2
i
x
First query - They must find the
mode and
median in the range
L to
R where
L and
R are inclusive (
L and
R are indices of the array) and return their
LCM. It is guaranteed that there will be an unique mode.
Second query- The element at
ith index must be updated to
x.
1 represents the first query and
2 represents the second query.
Note: Use greatest integer function for computing the median. This means that the median should be the floor value if the computed median is a fraction.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N,
Q separated by a single space.
The second line of each test case contains
N integers denoting elements of the array separated by single spaces.
The next
Q lines contain respective queries.
###Output: For each test case, print results of only the first type of queries in separate lines.

At every point of time, the frequency array will have all distinct elements. That is, at any particular moment, there will never be
A

.

###EXPLANATION: Example case 1: The frequency array is 2 4 6 8 9. For the first query- 1 1 3 the range is 1 to 3, i.e. for frequency 2 to 6. The mode element is 3 since it has the maximum frequency(6) in this subarray and the median is 2.5 which will be floored down to 2. Their Lcm is 6. So for this query 6 will be the output.
For the second query - 2 2 56 The element at the 2nd index which is 4 will be replaced by 56. The array will now become 2 56 6 8 9. This array will be used for the upcoming queries. But for a query of this type, no output is there.
For the third query- 1 1 3 The array is 2 56 6 8 9 and the range is 1 to 3 with corresponding frequencies 2, 56, 6. The mode element is 2 since it has the maximum frequency(56) in this subarray and the median is 2. Their LCM i.e 2 is the output.
