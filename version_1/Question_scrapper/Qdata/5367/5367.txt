For a permutation
P of integers from
1 to
N, let's define its value as
(1⊕P
1
)+(2⊕P
2
)+…+(N⊕P
N
).
Given
N, find the maximum possible value of the permutation of integers from
1 to
N.
As a reminder,
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T
− the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the permutation of integers from
1 to
N.

Explanation:
For
N=1, the only such permutation is
P=(1), its value is
1⊕1=0.
For
N=2, the permutation with the best value is
P=(2,1), with value
1⊕2+2⊕1=6.
For
N=3, the permutation with the best value is
P=(2,1,3), with value
1⊕2+2⊕1+3⊕3=6.
For
N=4, the permutation with the best value is
P=(2,1,4,3), with value
1⊕2+2⊕1+3⊕4+4⊕3=20.
