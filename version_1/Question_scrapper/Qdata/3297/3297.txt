In CPP we can't pass 2D arrays in normal way to a function. The array has to be declared in a special way.
Given a 2D array A[ ][ ] of size N x N consisting of integers. The task is to print all the elements in matrix (row and column order) form.
Example 1:
Input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Output: 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Explanation:
Elements of 2D array in row-column order 
are as mentioned in Sample Output.
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function twoDimensional() that takes two parameters: 2D array mat and N. You need to write the parameter for 2D array and print matrix.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= A[i][j] <= 106
