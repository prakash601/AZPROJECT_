You are given non-negative integers
A,
B and
C.
Does there exist a non-negative integer
X such that
A⊕X+B⊕X=C⊕X?
As a reminder,
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains three space-separated non-negative integers
A,
B and
C.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line the answer: YES if valid
X exists, and NO otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings Yes, YES, yes, yEs` will all be treated as identical.
