This is an interactive task
There is a tree consisting of
N nodes. A certain node
X is marked as special, but you don't know
X - your task is to find it. To achieve this, you can ask queries to obtain information about
X.
To be specific, you can ask queries in the form:
? Y
where
1≤Y≤N, and you will be provided with a random node on the path from node
Y to node
X, excluding
Y. If
Y=X you will receive
−1 instead.
You can ask at most
12 queries. Find the special node
X.
Note: The judge is not adaptive, i.e, node
X is chosen at the start before any interaction happens and does not change based on the queries you ask.
Interaction
Begin the interaction by reading a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.
For each test case, first read a single integer
N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
N−1 lines follow. The
i
th
of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between the nodes
u
i
and
v
i
.
After this, you can start making queries.
To ask a query, output ? Y (
1≤Y≤N). The judge will return some node (other than
Y) which lies on the path between node
Y and node
X, or
−1 if
Y=X.
To output the answer, output ! X, where
X is the special node that is hidden. This is not considered a query.
If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Test case
1:
X=1.
The query ? 1 gives
−1.
A query returns
−1 only if
Y=X, hence we can answer
X=1.
Test case
2:
X=3.
The query ? 1 gives node
2 which is in the path from node
1 to node
3 excluding node
1. That is the path between node
2 to node
3.
The query ? 2 gives node
3 which is in the path from node
2 to node
4 excluding node
2. That is the path between node
3 to node
3.
The query ? 3 gives
−1 as
Y=X in this case, hence we can answer node
3.
NOTE: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.
