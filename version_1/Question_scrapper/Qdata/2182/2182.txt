Given an integer N denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum.
Note: if no segment can be cut then return 0.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:Total length is 4, and the cut
lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
maximum 4 segments each of length 1.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
x = 5, y = 3, z = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Here total length is 5, and
the cut lengths are 5, 3 and 2. We can
make two segments of lengths 3 and 2.
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function maximizeTheCuts() that takes n, x, y, z as parameters and returns max number cuts.
Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints
1 <= N, x, y, z <= 104
