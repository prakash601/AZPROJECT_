This is an interactive problem.
There’s a hidden array
A consisting of
N distinct non-negative integers.
You are allowed to interact with the judge using queries. Each query is of the form:
X
Y: Given two non-negative integers
X and
Y
(1≤X≤N,0≤Y<2
30
) as the query, the hidden array
A is updated by setting
A
X
:=A
X
⊕Y, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
After each query, the judge will return the maximum value of the updated array.
Your task is to make all the elements of the array equal to
0 using at most
operations.
Interaction
The first line of input will contain a single integer
N, the size of the array
A.
To make a query, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers
X and
Y
(1≤X≤N,0≤Y<2
30
). Then, you must read a line containing a single non-negative integer, denoting the maximum element of the updated array. In case the query is invalid or you asked more than
10
5
queries, the judge will return
−1.
To end the interaction, once all the elements of the array are
0, you should print a single line containing an integer
0. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer:
1, if your output is correct, or
−1 otherwise.
Note
After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python.
After you print
0, do not forget to read a line containing a single integer:
1, if your output is correct, or
−1 otherwise.
If the test status is Wrong Answer, either your answer is incorrect or you asked more than
10
5
queries.
If the test status is Judge Error, either you have't flushed the output, or your I/O is invalid.

Explanation
Here,
A=[1,2,3] initially.
Operation
1:
A
1
:=A
1
⊕0,
A=[1,2,3]. The maximum value of updated array is
3.
Operation
2:
A
3
:=A
3
⊕7,
A=[1,2,4]. The maximum value of updated array is
4.
Operation
3:
A
2
:=A
2
⊕2,
A=[1,0,4]. The maximum value of updated array is
4.
Operation
4:
A
3
:=A
3
⊕4,
A=[1,0,0]. The maximum value of updated array is
1.
Operation
5:
A
1
:=A
1
⊕1,
A=[0,0,0]. The maximum value of updated array is
0.
