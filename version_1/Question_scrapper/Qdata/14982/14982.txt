In a far away galaxy there is war again. The treacherous Republic made k precision strikes of power ai on the Empire possessions. To cope with the republican threat, the Supreme Council decided to deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces.
To successfully complete the conflict, the confrontation balance after the blow should be a positive integer. The balance of confrontation is a number that looks like , where p = n! (n is the power of the Imperial strike), . After many years of war the Empire's resources are low. So to reduce the costs, n should be a minimum positive integer that is approved by the commanders.
Help the Empire, find the minimum positive integer n, where the described fraction is a positive integer.
Input
The first line contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 106). The second line contains k integers a1, a2, ..., ak (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107).
Output
Print the minimum positive integer n, needed for the Empire to win.
Please, do not use the %lld to read or write 64-but integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.
