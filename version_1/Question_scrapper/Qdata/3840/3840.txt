Chef's phone has a battery level of
N percent.
Each minute:
If the phone is on charging, the battery level increases by
2%.
Otherwise, the battery level decreases by
3%.
Find the minimum time in which Chef can make the battery level reach exactly
50%.
Note that the battery level should always lie in the range
0 to
100 (both included).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single lines of input
N - the current battery level of Chef's phone.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum time in which Chef can make the battery level reach exactly
50%.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can use his phone for
1 minute. Thus, the battery drops to
48%.
Then, he can charge it for
1 minute. Thus, the battery reaches exactly
50%.
Test case
2: The battery level is already at
50%.
Test case
3: Chef can charge the battery for
15 minutes and use it for
1 minute.
Thus, after
16 minutes, the battery will be
50% .
Test case
4: Chef can charge the battery for
25 minutes to reach the battery level of
50%.
