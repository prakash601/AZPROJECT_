You are given array
a1,a2,…,an
, consisting of non-negative integers.
Let's define operation of "elimination" with integer parameter
k
(
1≤k≤n
) as follows:
Choose
k
distinct array indices
1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤n
.
Calculate
x=ai1 & ai2 & … & aik
, where
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation (notes section contains formal definition).
Subtract
x
from each of
ai1,ai2,…,aik
; all other elements remain untouched.
Find all possible values of
k
, such that it's possible to make all elements of array
a
equal to
0
using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter
k
. It can be proven that exists at least one possible
k
for any array
a
.
Note that you firstly choose
k
and only after that perform elimination operations with value
k
you've chosen initially.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤200000
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai<230
) — array
a
itself.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
200000
.
Output
For each test case, print all values
k
, such that it's possible to make all elements of
a
equal to
0
in a finite number of elimination operations with the given parameter
k
.
Print them in increasing order.

Note
In the first test case:
If
k=1
, we can make four elimination operations with sets of indices
{1}
,
{2}
,
{3}
,
{4}
. Since
&
of one element is equal to the element itself, then for each operation
x=ai
, so
ai−x=ai−ai=0
.
If
k=2
, we can make two elimination operations with, for example, sets of indices
{1,3}
and
{2,4}
:
x=a1 & a3
=
a2 & a4
=
4 & 4=4
. For both operations
x=4
, so after the first operation
a1−x=0
and
a3−x=0
, and after the second operation —
a2−x=0
and
a4−x=0
.
If
k=3
, it's impossible to make all
ai
equal to
0
. After performing the first operation, we'll get three elements equal to
0
and one equal to
4
. After that, all elimination operations won't change anything, since at least one chosen element will always be equal to
0
.
If
k=4
, we can make one operation with set
{1,2,3,4}
, because
x=a1 & a2 & a3 & a4
=4
.
In the second test case, if
k=2
then we can make the following elimination operations:
Operation with indices
{1,3}
:
x=a1 & a3
=
13 & 25=9
.
a1−x=13−9=4
and
a3−x=25−9=16
. Array
a
will become equal to
[4,7,16,19]
.
Operation with indices
{3,4}
:
x=a3 & a4
=
16 & 19=16
.
a3−x=16−16=0
and
a4−x=19−16=3
. Array
a
will become equal to
[4,7,0,3]
.
Operation with indices
{2,4}
:
x=a2 & a4
=
7 & 3=3
.
a2−x=7−3=4
and
a4−x=3−3=0
. Array
a
will become equal to
[4,4,0,0]
.
Operation with indices
{1,2}
:
x=a1 & a2
=
4 & 4=4
.
a1−x=4−4=0
and
a2−x=4−4=0
. Array
a
will become equal to
[0,0,0,0]
.
Formal definition of bitwise AND:
Let's define bitwise AND (
&
) as follows. Suppose we have two non-negative integers
x
and
y
, let's look at their binary representations (possibly, with leading zeroes):
xk…x2x1x0
and
yk…y2y1y0
. Here,
xi
is the
i
-th bit of number
x
, and
yi
is the
i
-th bit of number
y
. Let
r=x & y
is a result of operation
&
on number
x
and
y
. Then binary representation of
r
will be
rk…r2r1r0
, where:
ri={
1, if xi=1 and yi=1
0, if xi=0 or yi=0
