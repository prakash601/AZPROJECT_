 — Boboniu
Boboniu has issued his currencies, named Bobo Yuan. Bobo Yuan (BBY) is a series of currencies. Boboniu gives each of them a positive integer identifier, such as BBY-1, BBY-2, etc.
Boboniu has a BBY collection. His collection looks like a sequence. For example:
We can use sequence
a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]
of length
n=9
to denote it.
Now Boboniu wants to fold his collection. You can imagine that Boboniu stick his collection to a long piece of paper and fold it between currencies:
Boboniu will only fold the same identifier of currencies together. In other words, if
ai
is folded over
aj
(
1≤i,j≤n
), then
ai=aj
must hold. Boboniu doesn't care if you follow this rule in the process of folding. But once it is finished, the rule should be obeyed.
A formal definition of fold is described in notes.
According to the picture above, you can fold
a
two times. In fact, you can fold
a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]
at most two times. So the maximum number of folds of it is
2
.
As an international fan of Boboniu, you're asked to calculate the maximum number of folds.
You're given a sequence
a
of length
n
, for each
i
(
1≤i≤n
), you need to calculate the maximum number of folds of
[a1,a2,…,ai]
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
).
Output
Print
n
integers. The
i
-th of them should be equal to the maximum number of folds of
[a1,a2,…,ai]
.

Note
Formally, for a sequence
a
of length
n
, let's define the folding sequence as a sequence
b
of length
n
such that:
bi
(
1≤i≤n
) is either
1
or
−1
.
Let
p(i)=[bi=1]+∑
i−1
j=1
bj
. For all
1≤i<j≤n
, if
p(i)=p(j)
, then
ai
should be equal to
aj
.
(
[A]
is the value of boolean expression
A
. i. e.
[A]=1
if
A
is true, else
[A]=0
).
Now we define the number of folds of
b
as
f(b)=∑
n−1
i=1
[bi≠bi+1]
.
The maximum number of folds of
a
is
F(a)=max{f(b)∣b is a folding sequence of a}
.
