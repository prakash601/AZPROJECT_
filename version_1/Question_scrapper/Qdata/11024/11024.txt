It is a holiday season, and Koala is decorating his house with cool lights! He owns
n
lights, all of which flash periodically.
After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters
ai
and
bi
. Light with parameters
ai
and
bi
will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every
ai
seconds starting from the
bi
-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments
bi
,
bi+ai
,
bi+2⋅ai
and so on.
You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters
ai
and
bi
. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.
Here is a graphic for the first example.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
), the number of lights.
The next line contains a string
s
of
n
characters. The
i
-th character is "1", if the
i
-th lamp is initially on. Otherwise,
i
-th character is "0".
The
i
-th of the following
n
lines contains two integers
ai
and
bi
(
1≤ai,bi≤5
)  — the parameters of the
i
-th light.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time.

Note
For first example, the lamps' states are shown in the picture above. The largest number of simultaneously on lamps is
2
(e.g. at the moment
2
).
In the second example, all lights are initially on. So the answer is
4
.
