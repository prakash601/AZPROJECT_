A permutation of length
N is an array of
N integers
(P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
) where every integer from
1 to
N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. The weight of a subsegment containing the elements
(P
l
,P
l+1
,…,P
r
) is defined as follows:
W(l,r)=(r−l+1)⋅
l≤i≤r
min
(P
i
) where
1≤l≤r≤N and
l≤i≤r
min
(P
i
) denotes the minimum element of the subsegment.
You are given two integers
N and
X. You need to determine if there exists a permutation of length
N such that it contains at least one subsegment having weight
X?
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T - the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N,X - the length of the permutation and the weight parameter mentioned in the question respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print YES if there exists a permutation of length
N having at least one subsegment with a weight of
X, otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1:
[1,2,3] is one of the valid permutations because it contains the following subsegment having weight

)=2⋅1=2
Test case
2: It can be proven that there does not exist any permutation of length
3 which has a subsegment having weight
