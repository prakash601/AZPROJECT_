You're given an array of integers
A and a permutation
P, each of size
N. Recall that a permutation of length
N is an array where every element from
1 to
N occurs exactly once.
The following operation is performed on the array
K times:
For each index
i (
1≤i≤N), add
A
P
i
to
A
i
simultaneously.
For example, if
A=[2,6,1,7] and
P=[3,1,4,2], after one operation
A=[2+A
3
,6+A
1
,1+A
4
,7+A
2
]=[3,8,8,13].
Find the values of
A modulo
998244353, after performing the above operation
K times.

Explanation:
The array
A evolves as follows
A
0
=[2,6,1,7]
A
1
=[3,8,8,13]
A
2
=[11,11,21,21]
A
3
=[32,22,42,32]
where
A
i
denotes the array after
i operations.
Thus, finally the elements of
A read
[32,22,42,32].
