For two positive integers
a and
b, let
g(a,b)= gcd
(a,b)+ lcm
(a,b).
For a positive integer
N, let
f(N) denote the minimum value of
g(a,b) over all the pairs of positive integers
(a,b) such that
a+b=N.
Find out the number of ordered pairs
(a,b) such that
a+b=N and
g(a,b)=f(N).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T — the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a positive integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs
(a,b) such that
a+b=N and
g(a,b)=f(N).

Explanation:
Test case
1:
For the pair
(1,3),
g(1,3)=gcd(1,3)+lcm(1,3)=1+3=4.
For the pair
(2,2),
g(2,2)=gcd(2,2)+lcm(2,2)=2+2=4.
For the pair
(3,1),
g(3,1)=gcd(3,1)+lcm(3,1)=1+3=4.
Hence,
f(4)=4. There are three pairs
(a,b) satisfying
a+b=N and
g(a,b)=f(N).
