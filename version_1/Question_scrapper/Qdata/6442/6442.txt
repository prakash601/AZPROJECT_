You have an
N×M grid consisting of
N rows numbered
1 to
N from top to bottom and
M columns numbered
1 to
M from left to right. Each cell of the grid is initially white.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Select a row
i
(1≤i≤N) and paint all the cells in row
i black.
Or select a column
i
(1≤i≤M) and paint all the cells in column
i black.
Note that cells which are already black remain black if they are painted over again.
Determine if it is possible to paint exactly
K cells of the grid black after performing some operations.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing
N,
M and
K — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of cells to paint black.
Output Format
For each test case, output the string YES if it is possible to paint exactly
K cells black, and NO if it is not.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

Explanation:
Test case 1: One possible sequence of operations is as follows:
Select column
2 and paint it black.
Select row
1 and paint it black.
Select column
4 and paint it black.
Select column
5 and paint it black.
Select row
3 and paint it black.
After performing these operations, the grid contains exactly
13 black cells. Hence the answer is YES.
