Help Chef to find the value of
f(n).Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo
1000000007.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input,
N.
###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line the value of
f(n) mod
1000000007.
