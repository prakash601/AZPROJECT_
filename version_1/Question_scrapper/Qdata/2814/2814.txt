Given two positive numbers X and Y, check if Y is a power of X or not.
  Example 1:
Input:
X = 2, Y = 8
Output:
1
Explanation:
23 is equal to 8.
  Example 2:
Input:


0
Explanation:
Any power of 1 is not 
equal to 8.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPowerOfAnother() which takes an integer and returns 1 if y is the power of x, else return 0.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints: 
1 <= x <= 103
1 <= y <= 108
