Chef is given a positive integer
N and we have to convert it to
1 using some operations.
In one operation, Chef can do the following:
Choose a prime number
p such that
p
∣
N
(p divides
N).
Replace
N with
p
N
.
However, Chef is also given some triggers of the form
(a,b) (
a is prime). Thus, if we divide by
p in some operation, we also have to multiply by
x for all triggers of the form
(p,x).
For example: Consider
N=18, and the triggers
(3,4) and
(3,2) exist. In one operation, if we choose to divide by
3, we have to multiply the result with
4 and
2. In other words,
(18↦
18
⋅4⋅2)=48. Thus,
18 is converted to
48.
Given a number
N and
M triggers of the form
(a,b) (where
a is always prime), find the minimum number of operations required to convert
N to
1 modulo
998244353. Print
−1 if it is not possible to do so.
Input Format
The first line of each input contains two integers
N and
M - the initial integer and the number of triggers given to the Chef.
The next
M lines describe the triggers. The
i
th
of these
M lines contains two space-separated integers
a and
b, denoting that Chef has to multiply by
b if he choses to divide by
a in some operation.
It is guaranteed that
(a

,b

)

=(a

) for
i

=j.
Output Format
Output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to convert
N to
1, or print
−1 if it is not possible to do so. In case it is possible to convert
N to
1, the minimum number of operations can be large, so output it modulo
998244353.

Output
6 1

3
Explanation:
We can convert
6 to
1 using
3 operations in the following way:
Divide
6 by
3. Since no trigger of the form
(3,x) exists,
6 converts to
3
6
=2.
Divide
2 by
2. Since
(2,3) exists,
2 is converted to
2↦
2
2
⋅3=3. - Divide
3 by
3. Since no trigger of the form
(3,x) exists,
3 converts to
3

=1.
It can be proven that we cannot convert
6 to
1 in less than
3 operations.
