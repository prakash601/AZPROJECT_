You are given a positive integer
k and an array
a consisting of
n integers. You will partition the array into
k non-empty segments such that each number belongs to exactly one segment.
Let's denote
s
i
as the sum of all numbers belonging to
i-th segment after partitioning. Your goal is to maximize the value of
min(s
1
,…,s
k
). Calculate and print this value.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
n and
k.
The second line of each test case contains
n space-separated integers
a
1
,…,a
n
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer --- the largest value of
min(s
1
,…,s
k
) you can obtain.
