You are given three strings
a
,
b
and
c
of the same length
n
. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The
i
-th letter of
a
is
ai
, the
i
-th letter of
b
is
bi
, the
i
-th letter of
c
is
ci
.
For every
i
(
1≤i≤n
) you must swap (i.e. exchange)
ci
with either
ai
or
bi
. So in total you'll perform exactly
n
swap operations, each of them either
ci↔ai
or
ci↔bi
(
i
iterates over all integers between
1
and
n
, inclusive).
For example, if
a
is "code",
b
is "true", and
c
is "help", you can make
c
equal to "crue" taking the
1
-st and the
4
-th letters from
a
and the others from
b
. In this way
a
becomes "hodp" and
b
becomes "tele".
Is it possible that after these swaps the string
a
becomes exactly the same as the string
b
?
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters
a
.
The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters
b
.
The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters
c
.
It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding
100
.
Output
Print
t
lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:
If it is possible to make string
a
equal to string
b
print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).
You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.
Example
input
Copy
4
aaa
bbb
ccc
abc
bca
bca
aabb
bbaa
baba
imi
mii
iim
output
Copy
NO
YES
YES
NO
Note
In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string
a
becomes exactly the same as string
b
.
In the second test case, you should swap
ci
with
ai
for all possible
i
. After the swaps
a
becomes "bca",
b
becomes "bca" and
c
becomes "abc". Here the strings
a
and
b
are equal.
In the third test case, you should swap
c1
with
a1
,
c2
with
b2
,
c3
with
b3
and
c4
with
a4
. Then string
a
becomes "baba", string
b
becomes "baba" and string
c
becomes "abab". Here the strings
a
and
b
are equal.
In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string
a
becomes exactly the same as string
b
.
