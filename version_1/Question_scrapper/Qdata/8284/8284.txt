This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version
q=n
.
You are given an array of integers
a1,a2,…,an
.
The cost of a subsegment of the array
[l,r]
,
1≤l≤r≤n
, is the value
f(l,r)=sum(l,r)−xor(l,r)
, where
sum(l,r)=al+al+1+…+ar
, and
xor(l,r)=al⊕al+1⊕…⊕ar
(
⊕
stands for bitwise XOR).
You will have
q
queries. Each query is given by a pair of numbers
Li
,
Ri
, where
1≤Li≤Ri≤n
. You need to find the subsegment
[l,r]
,
Li≤l≤r≤Ri
, with maximum value
f(l,r)
. If there are several answers, then among them you need to find a subsegment with the minimum length, that is, the minimum value of
r−l+1
.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n≤105
,
q=n
) — the length of the array and the number of queries.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
) — array elements.
i
-th of the next
q
lines of each test case contains two integers
Li
and
Ri
(
1≤Li≤Ri≤n
) — the boundaries in which we need to find the segment.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
It is guaranteed that
L1=1
and
R1=n
.
Output
For each test case print
q
pairs of numbers
Li≤l≤r≤Ri
such that the value
f(l,r)
is maximum and among such the length
r−l+1
is minimum. If there are several correct answers, print any of them.

Note
In all test cases, the first query is considered.
In the first test case,
f(1,1)=0−0=0
.
In the second test case,
f(1,1)=5−5=0
,
f(2,2)=10−10=0
. Note that
f(1,2)=(10+5)−(10⊕5)=0
, but we need to find a subsegment with the minimum length among the maximum values of
f(l,r)
. So, only segments
[1,1]
and
[2,2]
are the correct answers.
In the fourth test case,
f(2,3)=(12+8)−(12⊕8)=16
.
There are two correct answers in the fifth test case, since
f(2,3)=f(3,4)
and their lengths are equal.
