Salmon has some hidden numbers that he wants you to find!
Given an integer
N, find and output any two integers A and B such that:
1≤A,B≤10
9
, and
A∗B=N.
###Input: The first line of input consists of a single integer
T (
1≤T≤10
5
) -- the number of testcases.
The next
T lines will consist of one integer,
N (
1≤ N≤10
9
).
###Output: For each of the
T testcases, output two space-separated integers
A and
B.
