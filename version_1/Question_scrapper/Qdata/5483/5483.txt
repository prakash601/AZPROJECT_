You are given a tree with
N nodes numbered from
1 to
N. A set
S of nodes is called valid if there exist two vertices
u and
v (possibly,
u=v) such that every node in
S lies on the simple path from
u to
v.
Count the number of valid sets modulo
10
9
+7. Two sets are different if one node is included in one set and not in the other. If there are multiple pairs
(u,v) making a set valid, that set is still only counted once.
###Input
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains
N lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer
N, the number of tree nodes.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v representing an edge between nodes
u and
v.
###Output For each test case, output in a single line the number of valid sets modulo
10
9
+7.
###Constraints
