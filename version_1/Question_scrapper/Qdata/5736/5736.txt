Chef has an array A consisting of N elements. He wants to find number of pairs of non-intersecting segments [a, b] and [c, d] (1 ≤ a ≤ b < c ≤ d ≤ N) such there is no number that occurs in the subarray {Aa, Aa+1, ... , Ab} and {Ac, Ac+1, ... , Ad} simultaneously.
Help Chef to find this number.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - number of pairs of non-intersecting segments.

Explanation:
Example case 1. All possible variants are correct: {[1, 1], [2, 2]}, {[1, 1], [2, 3]}, {[1, 2], [3, 3]}, {[2, 2], [3, 3]}, {[1,1], [3, 3]}.
Example case 2. Correct segments: {[1, 1], [2, 2]}, {[1, 1], [4, 4]}, {[2, 2], [3, 3]}, {[3, 3], [4, 4]}.
