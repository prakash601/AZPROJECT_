Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find if there are two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a+b = c+d.
Example 1:
Input:N=7 A[] = {3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8} Output: 1Explanation:(3, 7) and (9, 1) are the pairs whosesum are equal.

Example 2:
Input:N=7 A[] = {65, 30, 7, 90, 1, 9, 8}Output: 0
  Your Task:
Since, this is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function findPairs() that takes array a and nas parametersand return 1 if pair exists else 0.

Expected Time Complexity:O(N2).
Expected Auxiliary Space:O(N2).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
