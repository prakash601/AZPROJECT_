Tonmoy has a special torch. The torch has
4 levels numbered
1 to
4 and
2 states (
On and
Off). Levels
1,2, and
3 correspond to the
On state while level
4 corresponds to the
Off state.
The levels of the torch can be changed as:
Level
1 changes to level
2.
Level
2 changes to level
3.
Level
3 changes to level
4.
Level
4 changes to level
1.
Given the initial state as
K and the number of changes made in the levels as
N, find the final state of the torch. If the final state cannot be determined, print
Ambiguous instead.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers
N,K - the number of changes made in the levels and initial state of the torch. Here,
K=0 denotes
Off state while
K=1 denotes
On state.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the final state of the torch, i.e.
On or
Off. If the final state cannot be determined, print
Ambiguous instead.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings
On,
ON,
on and
oN will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test Case
1: Initially, the torch is in
Off state. Since only level
4 corresponds to the
Off state, the torch is at level
4 initially. After
4 changes, the final level would be
4. Level
4 corresponds to the
Off state. Hence, finally the torch is
Off.
Test Case
2: Initially, the torch is in
On state. After
0 changes, the torch remains in the
On state.
Test Case
3: Initially, the torch is in
On state. This can correspond to any of the first
3 levels. Thus, we cannot determine the final level after
3 changes. Hence, the final state is
Ambiguous.
