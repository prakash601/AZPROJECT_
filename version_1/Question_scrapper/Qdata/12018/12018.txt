You are given an array
d1,d2,…,dn
consisting of
n
integer numbers.
Your task is to split this array into three parts (some of which may be empty) in such a way that each element of the array belongs to exactly one of the three parts, and each of the parts forms a consecutive contiguous subsegment (possibly, empty) of the original array.
Let the sum of elements of the first part be
sum1
, the sum of elements of the second part be
sum2
and the sum of elements of the third part be
sum3
. Among all possible ways to split the array you have to choose a way such that
sum1=sum3
and
sum1
is maximum possible.
More formally, if the first part of the array contains
a
elements, the second part of the array contains
b
elements and the third part contains
c
elements, then:
sum1=
∑
1≤i≤a
di,
sum2=
∑
a+1≤i≤a+b
di,
sum3=
∑
a+b+1≤i≤a+b+c
di.
The sum of an empty array is
0
.
Your task is to find a way to split the array such that
sum1=sum3
and
sum1
is maximum possible.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of elements in the array
d
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
d1,d2,…,dn
(
1≤di≤109
) — the elements of the array
d
.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum possible value of
sum1
, considering that the condition
sum1=sum3
must be met.
Obviously, at least one valid way to split the array exists (use
a=c=0
and
b=n
).

Note
In the first example there is only one possible splitting which maximizes
sum1
:
[1,3,1],[ ],[1,4]
.
In the second example the only way to have
sum1=4
is:
[1,3],[2,1],[4]
.
In the third example there is only one way to split the array:
[ ],[4,1,2],[ ]
.
