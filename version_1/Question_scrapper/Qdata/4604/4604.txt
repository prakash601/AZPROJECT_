You are given an array
A of length
K. Find any permutation
P of length
N such that only the prefixes of length
A
i
(
1≤i≤K) form a permutation.
Under the given constraints, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one permutation which satisfies the given condition.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.
Note: A permutation of length
N is an array where every element from
1 to
N occurs exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K - the length of the permutation to be constructed and the size of the array
A respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
K space-separated integers
A

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
P

Explanation:
Test case-1:
[2,3,1,6,4,5,7,8] is valid permutation because
Prefix of length
3=[2,3,1] is a permutation.
Prefix of length
6=[2,3,1,6,4,5] is a permutation.
Prefix of length
7=[2,3,1,6,4,5,7] is a permutation.
Prefix of length
8=[2,3,1,6,4,5,7,8] is a permutation.
None of the other prefixes form a permutation.
