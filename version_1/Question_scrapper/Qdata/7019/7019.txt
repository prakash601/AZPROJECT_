There are two types of vaccines available: Covaxin and Covishield.
A black marketeer has
X coins and wants to buy as many vaccines as possible. Due to the black marketing concerns, government has enforced the following policy:
i
th
dose of Covaxin costs
a+(i−1)⋅b coins for every
i≥1.
i
th
dose of Covishield costs
c+(i−1)⋅d coins for every
i≥1.
The values of the four parameters
a,b,c and
d, however isn't constant and might vary from query to query. In general the value of these four parameters for
i
th
query will be
A
i
,B
i
,C
i
and
D
i
respectively. Let
ans
i
be the maximum total quantity of vaccines the black marketeer can buy corresponding to the
i
th
query. For each query, you have to find the value of
ans
i
.
You will be given integers
A

,P,Q,R,S,T and
M which will define the queries to be followed.
For
i≥1 and

Note: Since the output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
For the first query,
[a,b,c,d]=[A
1
,B
1
,C
1
,D
1
]=[2,3,4,1]. It is optimal to buy
2 doses of Covaxin
(2+5=7) and
2 doses of Covishield
(4+5=9). So the total money spent is
7+9=16 and now the black marketeer cannot buy any more doses. So the answer is 4.
For the second query,
[a,b,c,d]=[A
2
,B

]=[(2+11⋅4)mod20+3,(3+11⋅4)mod20+7,(4+11⋅4)mod20+8,(1+11⋅4)mod20+4]=[9,14,16,9].
For the third and the last query,
[a,b,c,d]=[A
