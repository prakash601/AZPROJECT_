There are
n
cities in a row numbered from
1
to
n
.
The cities will be building broadcasting stations. The station in the
i
-th city has height
hi
and range
wi
. It can broadcast information to city
j
if the following constraints are met:
i≤j≤wi
, and
for each
k
such that
i<k≤j
, the following condition holds:
hk<hi
.
In other words, the station in city
i
can broadcast information to city
j
if
j≥i
,
j
is in the range of
i
-th station, and
i
is strictly highest on the range from
i
to
j
(including city
j
).
At the beginning, for every city
i
,
hi=0
and
wi=i
.
Then
q
events will take place. During
i
-th event one of the following will happen:
City
ci
will rebuild its station so that its height will be strictly highest among all stations and
wci
will be set to
gi
.
Let
bj
be the number of stations that can broadcast information to city
j
. Print the sum of
bj
over all
j
satisfying
li≤j≤ri
.
Your task is to react to all events and print answers to all queries.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — number of cities and number of events.
Then
q
lines follow. The
i
-th line begins with an integer
pi
(
pi=1
or
pi=2
).
If
pi=1
a station will be rebuilt. Then two integers
ci
and
gi
(
1≤ci≤gi≤n
) follow — the city in which the station is rebuilt and its new broadcasting range.
If
pi=2
you are given a query. Then two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
) follow — the range of cities in the query.
Output
For each query, print in a single line the sum of
bj
over the given interval.

Note
In the first test case, only station
1
reaches city
1
before and after it is rebuilt.
In the second test case, after each rebuild, the array
b
looks as follows:
[1,1,1,2,1]
;
[1,2,2,3,2]
;
[1,2,2,1,2]
