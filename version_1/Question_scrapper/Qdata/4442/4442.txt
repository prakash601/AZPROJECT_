There are
N tasks waiting in line to be executed. The execution time for the
i
th
task is
A
i
seconds.
Chef has two processors to execute these
N tasks. Both these processors work simultaneously. Each processor executes the assigned tasks one by one.
Chef assigns a prefix of these tasks to the first processor and the remaining tasks to the second processor.
For example, if there are
3 tasks, Chef can do one of the following:
Assign no task to the first processor. This means, the second processor will execute tasks
1,2 and
3.
Assign task
1 to the first processor. This means, the second processor will execute tasks
2 and
3.
Assign tasks
1 and
2 to the first processor. This means, the second processor will execute task
3.
Assign tasks
1,2 and
3 to the first processor. Thus, second processor would execute no tasks.
Find the minimum time in which all the tasks can be executed.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of tasks waiting to be executed.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated positive integers
A

N
denoting the execution time for each task.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time in which all tasks can be executed.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef assigns task
1 to the first processor and tasks
2 and
3 to the second processor. The first processor takes
4 seconds to execute task
1. The second processor takes
2+3=5 seconds to execute tasks
2 and
3. Thus, atleast
5 seconds are required to execute all tasks.
Test Case 2: Chef assigns tasks
1,2 and
3 to the first processor. Processes
4,5 ad
6 are executed by second processor.
Test Case 3: Chef assigns task
1 to the first processor. No task is executed by second processor.
