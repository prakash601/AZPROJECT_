A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example,
P→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here,
1 unit of
P is converted into
a unit of
Q and
b unit of
R after completion of the reaction.
You are given

Explanation:
Test Cse
1: We have
4 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds
1,2,3, and
4 as
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
, and
A
4
respectively. Initially, the amount of
A
1
,A
2
,A
3
, and
A
4
present is
5,10,12, and
2 respectively.
The two equations are:
A
1
→3⋅A
2
+4⋅A
3
A
3
→2⋅A
4
We know that
1 unit of
A
1
produces
3 units of
A
2
and
4 units of
A
3
. Thus, the initial
5 units of
A
1
decompose to
5⋅3=15 units of
A
2
and
5⋅4=20 units of
A
3
. Note that now there are
0 units of
A
1
left.
Considering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be
[0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2].
We also know that
1 unit of
A
3
decomposes to
2 units of
A
4
. The total amount of
A
3
available for decomposition would be
32 units
(12 units were available initially and
20 units were formed due to decomposition
). Thus these
32 units would produce
32⋅2=64 units of
A
4
.
Thus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are
[0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66].
