You are given three integers
N,
K and
X. Is it possible to find a sequence of non-negative integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
such that the number of pairs of indices
(i,j) (
1≤i≤j≤N) satisfying
A
i
⊕A
j
=X is equal to
K? Here,
⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
,
and
.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find a sequence satisfying the given condition or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).

Explanation:
Example case 1: For example,
A=[2,2,1,2] satisfies the given condition, since there are exactly
3 pairs
(i,j) such that
A
i
⊕A
j
=3.
Example case 3: For example,
A=[8,12,3,14,8,15,10,10,8,14] satisfies the given condition, since there are exactly
8 pairs with XOR equal to
2.
