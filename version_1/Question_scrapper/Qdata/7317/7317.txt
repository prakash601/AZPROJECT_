Given a tree with n nodes. Split it into 3 parts such that all the three parts are connected components in original graph and each node is exactly present in one of the parts and the following function is minimised: Let s1,s2,s3 be the sizes of the 3 parts (or connected components) then
f=∣s1−s2∣+∣s2−s3∣+∣s1−s3∣
Also calculate the number of ways of splitting the tree. Two ways are considered different if different sets of edges is removed.
###Input:
First line will contain
n, number of vertices in the tree.
Each of the next
n−1 lines contain two space separated integers
u and
v denoting an edge between u and v
###Output: Output in a single line two space centered integers denoting the optimal value of function and number of ways to achieve it.
###Constraints
3≤n≤100000
###Sample Input 1: 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5
###Sample Output 1: 2 3
###Sample Input 2: 9 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 4 6 4 7 5 8 5 9
###Sample Output 2: 0 1
###EXPLANATION: For first input, Optimum Splitting=[1]+[2,3]+[4,5] or [1,2]+[3]+[4,5] or [1,2]+[3,4]+[5] Hence number of ways=3 and f=|2-1|+|2-2|+|2-1|=2
For second, Optimum Splliting=[1,2,3]+[4,6,7]+[5,8,9] Hence number of ways=1 and f=|3-3|+|3-3|+|3-3|=0
