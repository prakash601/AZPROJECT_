You are given a permutation
p
consisting of
n
integers
1,2,…,n
(a permutation is an array where each element from
1
to
n
occurs exactly once).
Let's call an array
a
bipartite if the following undirected graph is bipartite:
the graph consists of
n
vertices;
two vertices
i
and
j
are connected by an edge if
i<j
and
ai>aj
.
Your task is to find a bipartite array of integers
a
of size
n
, such that
ai=pi
or
ai=−pi
, or report that no such array exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅105
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤106
) — the size of the permutation.
The second line contains
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
.
The sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
106
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer in the following format. If such an array
a
does not exist, print "NO" in a single line. Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and
n
integers — array
a
in the second line.
