Ada has two matrices
A and
B, each with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
N columns (numbered
1 through
N).
Ada may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose an integer
i (
1≤i≤N), then swap row
i and column
i in matrix
A. (Formally, for each valid
j, she swaps
A
i,j
with
A
j,i
.)
Is it possible to transform matrix
A into matrix
B?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains
N space-separated integers
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,…,A
i,N
.
N more lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains
N space-separated integers
B
i,1
,B
i,2
,…,B
i,N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if it is possible to transform
A into
B or "No" if it is impossible (without quotes).

Explanation:
Example case 1: We can swap the second row with the second column and in the resulting matrix, swap the first row with the first column.
