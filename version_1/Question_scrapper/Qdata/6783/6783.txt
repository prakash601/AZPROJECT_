The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:
The MEX of
[2,2,1] is
0, because
0 does not belong to the array.
The MEX of
[3,1,0,1] is
2, because
0 and
1 belong to the array, but
2 does not.
The MEX of
[0,3,1,2] is
4, because
0,1,2 and
3 belong to the array, but
4 does not.
You are given an array
A of length
N. You create a list
B consisting of the MEX-es of all subarrays of the array
A. Formally, for all pairs
(l,r) such that
lrN, you calculate
MEXA
l
A
l+1
A
r
and append the value in the list
B. Find the
K-th smallest value in the list
B.
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
Input Format
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the given array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the
K-th smallest value in the list
B.

Explanation:
Test case

)=0,
MEX(A

)=2,
MEX(A

)=3,
MEX(A

)=1,
MEX(A
3
)=0. Hence the list
B=[0,2,3,1,1,0] and the
4-th smallest value in
B is
1.
Test case
2: The MEX of all subarrays of the array
A is
0. Hence the
2-nd smallest element in the list
B is
0.
