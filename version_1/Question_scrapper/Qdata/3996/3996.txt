A football competition has just finished. The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player.
You are given two sequences
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
. For each valid
i, player
i scored
A
i
goals and committed
B
i
fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets
20 points, and for each foul,
10 points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have
0 points instead.
You need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

The third line contains
N space-separated integers

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of points.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The first player gets
800 points for scoring goals and has
20 points deducted for fouls. Likewise, the second player gets
560 points and the third player gets
800 points. The third player is the one with the maximum number of points.
