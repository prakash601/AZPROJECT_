Vova has recently learned what a circulaton in a graph is. Recall the definition: let
G=(V,E)
be a directed graph. A circulation
f
is such a collection of non-negative real numbers
fe
(
e∈E
), that for each vertex
v∈V
the following conservation condition holds:
∑
e∈δ−(v)
fe=
∑
e∈δ+(v)
fe
where
δ+(v)
is the set of edges that end in the vertex
v
, and
δ−(v)
is the set of edges that start in the vertex
v
. In other words, for each vertex the total incoming flow should be equal to the total outcoming flow.
Let a
lr
-circulation be such a circulation
f
that for each edge the condition
le≤fe≤re
holds, where
le
and
re
for each edge
e∈E
are two non-negative real numbers denoting the lower and upper bounds on the value of the circulation on this edge
e
.
Vova can't stop thinking about applications of a new topic. Right now he thinks about the following natural question: let the graph be fixed, and each value
le
and
re
be a linear function of a real variable
t
:
le(t)=aet+be
re(t)=cet+de
Note that
t
is the same for all edges.
Let
t
be chosen at random from uniform distribution on a segment
[0,1]
. What is the probability of existence of
lr
-circulation in the graph?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
m
(
1≤n≤1000
,
1≤m≤2000
).
Each of the next
m
lines describes edges of the graph in the format
ue
,
ve
,
ae
,
be
,
ce
,
de
(
1≤ue,ve≤n
,
−104≤ae,ce≤104
,
0≤be,de≤104
), where
ue
and
ve
are the startpoint and the endpoint of the edge
e
, and the remaining 4 integers describe the linear functions for the upper and lower bound of circulation.
It is guaranteed that for any
t∈[0,1]
and for any edge
e∈E
the following condition holds
0≤le(t)≤re(t)≤104
.
Output
Print a single real integer — the probability of existence of
lr
-circulation in the graph, given that
t
is chosen uniformly at random from the segment
[0,1]
. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute difference from jury's answer is not greater than
10−6
.

output
Copy
0.25
Note
In the first example the conservation condition allows only circulations with equal values
fe
for all three edges. The value of circulation on the last edge should be
4
whatever
t
is chosen, so the probability is
P(4∈[3,−4t+7]  &  4∈[−2t+5,t+6])=0.25
