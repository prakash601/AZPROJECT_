Chef has a new customer and he wants to prepare his order as soon as possible. While preparing, he sees that the mint sauce is finished. He has to run upstairs to get it from other kitchen. Chef is currently on the
X
th
stair. He has to climb all the way up to the
Y
th
stair in minimum number of steps. In one step, Chef can do one of the following things:
Climb a single stair. ( i.e go from the
X
th
stair to the
(X+1)
th
stair. )
Climb two stairs only if the final stair falls at a prime number position. ( i.e. go from the
X
th
stair to the
(X+2)
th
stair, only if
(X+2) is a prime number)
Help Chef reach the
Y
th
stair from the
X
th
stair in minimum number of steps.
See Explanation for more clarity.
Note: The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef starts from
2
nd
, goes to
3
rd
stair, then to
5
th
stair as
5 or
(3+2) is prime number. Now, from
5
th
stair, Chef goes to
7
th
stair as
7 or
(5+2) is a prime number, then Chef goes to
8
th
stair, then to
9
th
stair and finally to
10
th
stair. This approach takes a total of
6 steps which is the minimum possible number of steps Chef can take to reach the
10
th
stair starting from the
2
nd
stair.

3: Starting from the
34
th
stair, Chef moves through the stairs as following.
