In the nation of Chefland there are villages at co-ordinates
(x,y) whenever
x and
y are non-zero odd co-prime integers.
x can be either positive or negative, but
y is always positive.
In each village
(x,y) there is a crossroads, with the roads marked North, South, East, West.
Road East leads to
(x+2y,y).
Road West leads to
(x−2y,y).
Road North leads to either
(x,y+2x) or
(−x,−(y+2x)), chosen so that the new
y co-ordinate is positive.
Road South leads to either
(x,y−2x) or
(−x,−(y−2x)), chosen so that the new
y co-ordinate is positive.
Some citizens of Chefland prefer these equivalent definitions for the North and South roads:
Road North leads to
{
{
(x,y+2x)
(−x,−(y+2x))
when y+2x>0
when y+2x<0
Road South leads to
{
{
(x,y−2x)
(−x,−(y−2x))
when y−2x>0
when y−2x<0
The cost to travel a road between two adjacent villages is 1 pound. Determine the minimum cost to travel between villages at
(x
1
,y
1
) and
(x
2
,y
2
).
Notes:
The road network is defined so that the villages form an undirected graph.
There are two roads joining
(−1,1) and
(1,1), but otherwise there is a single road between any adjacent pair of villages.
The road network does not form a simple grid - that would be too easy!
###Input:
First line will contain
T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, which has four integers

###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line, the answer. That is, the minimum cost in pounds to travel from
(x

,y
1
) to
(x
2
,y
2
).

Explanation:
In the first test case, the start and end village co-ordinates are both
(7,5), so the cost is 0.
In the second test case:
From
(1,1) go West to
(−1,1) in one step. So the cost is 1.
Note that the South road from
(1,1) also goes to
(−1,1).
In the third test case:
From
(3,7) go South to
(3,1).
From
(3,1) go West to
(1,1).
From
(1,1) go West to
(−1,1).
From
(−1,1) go West to
(−3,1).
From
(−3,1) go West to
(−5,1).
From
(−5,1) go North to
(5,9).
