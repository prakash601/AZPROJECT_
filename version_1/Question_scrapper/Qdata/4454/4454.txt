There are
N balls in a bag. Initially, the
i
th
ball has a number
A
i
on it.
In one second, a ball with number
k
(k>1), dissociates into
k balls, where each of the
k balls has number
(k−1) written on it.
If
k=1, there is no change on the state of the ball.
Find the number of balls in the bag after
10
100
seconds. Since the final number of balls can be huge, output the answer modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
, denoting the number of balls in the bag.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, denoting the initial number written on the balls.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of balls in the bag after
10
100
seconds. Since the final number of balls can be huge, output the answer modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Initially, the balls in the bag are
{2}.
After
1 second: The ball with number
2 dissociates into two balls with number
1. Thus, the bag looks like
{1,1}.
No more dissociation is possible after this. Thus, the final number of balls is
2.
Test case
2: Initially, the balls in the bag are
{1,2}.
After
1 second: The ball with number
2 dissociates into two balls with number
1. Thus, the final bag looks like
{1,1,1}.
No more dissociation is possible after this. Thus, the final number of balls is
3.
Test case
3: Initially, the balls in the bag are
{3,1,3}.
After
1 second: The balls with number
3 dissociates into three balls with number
2. Thus, the bag looks like
{2,2,2,1,2,2,2}.
After
2 seconds: The balls with number
2 dissociates into two balls with number
1. Thus, the bag looks like
{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}.
No more dissociation is possible after this. Thus, the final number of balls is
13.
