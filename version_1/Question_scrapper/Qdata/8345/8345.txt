You are given an array
a1,a2,…,an
, which is sorted in non-descending order. You decided to perform the following steps to create array
b1,b2,…,bn
:
Create an array
d
consisting of
n
arbitrary non-negative integers.
Set
bi=ai+di
for each
bi
.
Sort the array
b
in non-descending order.
You are given the resulting array
b
. For each index
i
, calculate what is the minimum and maximum possible value of
di
you can choose in order to get the given array
b
.
Note that the minimum (maximum)
di
-s are independent of each other, i. e. they can be obtained from different possible arrays
d
.
Input
The first line contains the single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of arrays
a
,
b
and
d
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
;
ai≤ai+1
) — the array
a
in non-descending order.
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤109
;
bi≤bi+1
) — the array
b
in non-descending order.
Additional constraints on the input:
there is at least one way to obtain the array
b
from the
a
by choosing an array
d
consisting of non-negative integers;
the sum of
n
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print two lines. In the first line, print
n
integers
d
min
1
,d
min
2
,…,d
min
n
, where
d
min
i
is the minimum possible value you can add to
ai
.
Secondly, print
n
integers
d
max
1
,d
max
2
,…,d
max
n
, where
d
max
i
is the maximum possible value you can add to
ai
.
All
d
min
i
and
d
max
i
values are independent of each other. In other words, for each
i
,
d
min
i
is just the minimum value among all possible values of
di
.

Note
In the first test case, in order to get
d
min
1
=5
, we can choose, for example,
d=[5,10,6]
. Then
b
=
[2+5,3+10,5+6]
=
[7,13,11]
=
[7,11,13]
.
For
d
min
2
=4
, we can choose
d
=
[9,4,8]
. Then
b
=
[2+9,3+4,5+8]
=
[11,7,13]
=
[7,11,13]
.
