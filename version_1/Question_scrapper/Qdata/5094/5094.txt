You are given a tree with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
You have to assign an integer to each node; for each valid
i, let's denote the integer assigned to node
i by
A
i
. This assignment must satisfy the following conditions:
For each valid
i,
1≤A
i
≤10
5
.
For each simple path in the tree which contains at least two nodes, let's denote the set of nodes in this path by
S. Then,
∑
v∈S
A
v
is not divisible by
∣S∣.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that nodes
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them. It can be proved that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

2≤N≤100

Explanation:
Example case 1: This assignment satisfies all the conditions. For example, for the path
3→5→1→2, the sum
12+9+4+9=34 is not divisible by
4 (the number of nodes in the path).
