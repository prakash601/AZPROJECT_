Bitwise operators are useful when we want to work with bits. Here, we'll take a look at them.
Given three positive integers a, b and c. Your task is to perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
1. d = a ^ a
2. e = c ^ b
3. f = a & b
4. g = c | (a ^ a)
5. h = ~e
Note: ^ is for xor. The working of bitwise operators can be found here.
Example:
Input:
a = 4
b = 8
c = 2

10

2
-11
Constraints:
1 <= A, B, C <= 106
