Reve has two integers

Let

Let the cost of the permutation
𝑝
be the maximum element of
𝑐
.
Koxia wants you to construct a permutation with the minimum possible cost.
†
A permutation of length
𝑛
is an array consisting of
𝑛
distinct integers from
1
to
𝑛
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
𝑛=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤2000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
𝑛
and
𝑘
(
1≤𝑘≤𝑛≤2⋅
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
𝑛
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output
𝑛
integers
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,…,
𝑝
𝑛
, which is a permutation with minimal cost. If there is more than one permutation with minimal cost, you may output any of them.

Note
In the first test case,
𝑐
1
=max(
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,
𝑝
3
)+min(
𝑝
1
,
𝑝
2
,
𝑝
3
)=5+1=6
.
𝑐
2
=max(
𝑝
2
,
𝑝
3
,
𝑝
4
)+min(
𝑝
2
,
𝑝
3
,
𝑝
4
)=3+1=4
.
𝑐
3
=max(
𝑝
3
,
𝑝
4
,
𝑝
5
)+min(
𝑝
3
,
𝑝
4
,
𝑝
5
)=4+2=6
.
Therefore, the cost is
max(6,4,6)=6
. It can be proven that this is the minimal cost.
