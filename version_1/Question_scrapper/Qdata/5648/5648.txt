MoEngage goes shopping with Chef. There are
N ingredients placed on a line, numbered
1 to
N from left to right.
At any point in time, MoEngage can choose the ingredient numbered
x and do one of the following operations:
If the chosen ingredient is not the leftmost amongst the remaining ingredients, remove the left neighbor. This operation costs
L
x
coins.
If the chosen ingredient is not the rightmost amongst the remaining ingredients, remove the right neighbor. This operation costs
R
x
coins.
Note: MoEngage can perform at most one operation of one type on a particular ingredient. For example, you can't remove elements from the left of ingredient
x two times. However, you can remove one ingredient each from the left and from the right of ingredient
.
MoEngage performs the operations until only one ingredient is left.
Find the minimum number of coins he needs to pay so that only one ingredient is left.

Explanation:
Test case 1: The number of ingredients is already
1. Thus, MoEngage has to spend
0 coins.
Test case 2: Initially, the list of ingredients is
[1,2,3,4]. MoEngage can apply the operations in the following way:
Apply the first operation on ingredient
4. Coins required for this are
L
4
=2. The updated list of ingredients is
[1,2,4].
Apply the second operation on ingredient
2. Coins required for this are
R
2
=2. The updated list of ingredients is
[1,2].
Apply the first operation on ingredient
2. Coins required for this are
L
2
=1. The updated list of ingredients is
[2].
Thus, the total number of coins required is
2+2+1=5. It can be shown that MoEngage cannot achieve a single ingredient in less than
5 coins.
