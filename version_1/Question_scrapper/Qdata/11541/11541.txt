You are given two segments
[l1;r1]
and
[l2;r2]
on the
x
-axis. It is guaranteed that
l1<r1
and
l2<r2
. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.
The example of two segments on the
x
-axis.
Your problem is to find two integers
a
and
b
such that
l1≤a≤r1
,
l2≤b≤r2
and
a≠b
. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment
[l1;r1]
and the second one belongs to the segment
[l2;r2]
.
It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
You have to answer
q
independent queries.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤500
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains four integers
l1i,r1i,l2i
and
r2i
(
1≤l1i,r1i,l2i,r2i≤109,l1i<r1i,l2i<r2i
) — the ends of the segments in the
i
-th query.
Output
Print
2q
integers. For the
i
-th query print two integers
ai
and
bi
— such numbers that
l1i≤ai≤r1i
,
l2i≤bi≤r2i
and
ai≠bi
. Queries are numbered in order of the input.
It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
