There are
n chocolates, and you are given an array of
n numbers where the
i-th number
A
i
is the flavour type of the
i-th chocolate. Sebrina wants to eat as many different types of chocolates as possible, but she also has to save at least
x number of chocolates for her little brother.
Find the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types Sebrina can have.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T --- the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case consists of two integers
n,
x - The number of chocolates Sabrina has and the number of chocolates she has to save for her brother, respectively.
The second line contains
n integers
A
1
,…,A
n
, where the
i-th chocolate has type
A
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number of distinct chocolate flavours Sabrina can eat.

Explanation:
Test case
1: In the first case, the maximum number of chocolates Sebrina can have is
1 as she has to leave
1 chocolate for her brother. Thus, the maximum number of distinct chocolates is also
1.
Test case
2: Sebrina has to leave
2 chocolates for her brother. She can eat any
2 chocolates. Since all the chocolates have the same flavor, it does not matter which chocolates she eats. The maximum number of distinct chocolates would be
1.
Test case
3: Sebrina needs to save
3 chocolates for her brother. She can eat any
2 chocolates. To maximize the number of distinct chocolates, she can eat chocolates
1 and
5 with flavors
50 and
100 respectively. Thus maximum number of distinct chocolates is
2.
