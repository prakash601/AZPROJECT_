Chef has an array
A with
N elements. He wants to find
N points
P
1
,…,P
N
with integer coordinates on the 2D coordinate plane such that, for all pairs of indices
i and
j (
1≤i<j≤N), the Manhattan distance from
P
i
to
P
j
is
A
i
+A
j
. Help him find any
N points satisfying the condition, or state that no such points exist.
As a reminder, the Manhattan distance between the points
(x
1
,y
1
) and
(x
2
,y
2
) is defined as
∣x

−x

∣.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, if there is no set of points satisfying the stated condition, output NO.
Otherwise, output YES on one line, then output
N lines. Each line should contain two integers
X
i
and
Y
i
(
−10
18
≤X
i
,Y
i
≤10
18
) denoting the
x and
y coordinates of the point
P
i
respectively.
It can be proven that if a solution exists, then a solution exists under the constraints above.
Output is case insensitive.

Explanation:
For the first test case, we can choose
P
1
=(3,9) and
P
2
=(13,17). The Manhattan distance between
P
1
and
P
2
is
∣3−13∣+∣9−17∣=18, and
A
1
+A
2
=5+13=18.
For the second test case, we can choose
P
1
=(18,5),
P
2
=(10,1), and
P
3
=(1,16).
The Manhattan distance between
P
1
and
P
2
is
∣18−10∣+∣5−1∣=12, and
A
1
+A
2
=8+4=12.
The Manhattan distance between
P
1
and
P
3
is
∣18−1∣+∣5−16∣=28, and
A
1
+A
3
=8+20=28.
The Manhattan distance between
P
2
and
P
3
is
∣10−1∣+∣1−16∣=24, and
A
2
+A
3
=4+20=24.
For the third test case, it can be proven that there does not exist
5 points satisfying these constraints.
