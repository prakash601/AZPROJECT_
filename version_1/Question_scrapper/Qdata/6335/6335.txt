  Charles, Laura and Logan have been staying in a hotel in Oklahoma City. The Reavers catched up with them, but Charles suffers a seizure and telepathically freezes everyone in the hotel
Logan must inject Charles with a suppressant. However, to counter this freezing effect, he must find the DIGIT IMMUNE numbers as soon as possible.
A Digit-Immune number is a number which is not divisible by any of its digits. For example: 23,27,37 etc.
Now, there also exists an additional condition to these type of numbers.
A digit-immune number will be called if it contains only odd digits.
He has to tackle certain queries.
In a single query, Logan is given two integers A and B. He has to find Kth odd digit-immune number between A and B (both inclusive).
If there are less than K odd digit-immune numbers between A and B, print "-1"(without quotes).
  Input
First line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contains three integers A, B and K respectively.
  Output
For each of the Q queries, print the required answer in new line.
  Constraints
1 ≤ Q ≤ 50
1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1018
1 ≤ K ≤ 1018
  Example
Input:
1
10 100 4
Output:
59
  Explanation
Odd-digit-immune numbers in given range are {37,53,57,59,....}.
