Hackerman wants to know who is the better player between Bob and Alice with the help of a game.
The game proceeds as follows:
First, Alice throws a die and gets the number
A
Then, Bob throws a die and gets the number
B
Alice wins the game if the sum on the dice is a prime number; and Bob wins otherwise.
Given
A and
B, determine who wins the game.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the winner of the game: Alice or Bob.
Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, Alice, ALICE, AlIce and aLIcE will all be considered equivalent.
Constraints
1≤T≤36
1≤A≤6
1≤B≤6

Alice
Bob
Explanation:
Test case
1:
A=2 and
B=1. Their sum is
2+1=3 which is a prime number, so Alice wins.
Test case
2:
A=1 and
B=1. Their sum is
1+1=2 which is a prime number, so Alice wins.
Test case
3:
A=2 and
B=2. Their sum is
2+2=4 which is not a prime number, so Bob wins.
