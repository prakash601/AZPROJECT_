In order to beat AlphaZero, Chef Ada is improving her chess calculation skills.
Today, Ada took a big chessboard with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
N columns (numbered
1 through
N). Let's denote the square in row
r and column
c of the chessboard by
(r,c). Ada wants to place some rooks on the chessboard in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:
Each square of the board contains at most one rook.
There are no four rooks forming a rectangle. Formally, there should not be any four valid integers
r

c

(

) such that there are rooks on squares
(r
,c
),
(r

),
(r

) and
(r

).
The number of rooks is at least
8N.
Help Ada find a possible distribution of rooks. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print
N lines. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain a single string with length
N describing row
i of the chessboard; for each valid
j, the
j-th character of this string should be 'O' if there is a rook in the square
(i,j) or '.' if this square is empty.
Constraints
100≤N≤1,000
the sum of
N

over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅10

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points):

Explanation
The output depicts the top left
4×4 square on the board. The rest of the board is cropped.
