Leha is a bright mathematician. Today he is investigating whether an integer is divisible by some square number or not.
He has a positive integer X represented as a product of N integers a1, a2, .... aN. He has somehow figured out that there exists some integer P such that the number X is divisible by P2, but he is not able to find such P himself. Can you find it for him? If there are more than one possible values of P possible, you can print any one of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of intgers in presentation of X.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, .... aN.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer P deoting the answer for this test case. Note that P must be in range from 2 to 1018 inclusive. It's guaranteed that at least one answer exists. If there are more than one possible answers, print any.

3
21 11 6
3
Explanation:
Example case 1. X = 21 * 11 * 6 = 1386. It's divisible by 9 which is a square number, as 9 = 32. So P = 3.
