X stocks at Rs.
Z each. What is Chef's total profit after he sells them?
Chef's profit equals the total amount he received by selling the stocks, minus the total amount he spent buying them.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef bought
X=2 stocks for
Y=5 each, making the total amount spent by Chef
=2⋅5=10.
Chef can sell this stock today for
Z=20, making the total amount received by Chef
=2⋅20=40.
The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals
40−10=30.
Test Case 2: Chef bought
X=3 stocks for
Y=1 each, making the total amount spent by Chef
=3⋅1=3.
Chef can sell this stock today for
Z=2, making the total amount received by Chef
=3⋅2=6.
The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals
6−3=3.
Test Case 3: Chef bought
X=4 stocks for
Y=5 each, making the total amount spent by Chef
=4⋅5=20.
Chef can sell this stock today for
Z=6, making the total amount received by Chef
=4⋅6=24.
The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals
24−20=4
