Chef has an integer
N. It is known that the largest odd divisor of
N does not exceed
10
5
.
Determine two non-negative integers
A and
B such that
A
2
+B
2
=N, or report that no such pair exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output space-separated
A and
B such that
A
2
+B
2
=N or
−1 if no such pair exists.

Explanation:
Test case
1: A possible pair
(A,B) such that
A
2
+B
2
=N is
(8,6). Here,
8

=64+36=100.
Test case
2: There is no pair
(A,B) such that
A
2
+B
2
=N.
Test case
3: A possible pair
(A,B) such that
A
2
+B
2
=N is
(2,3). Here,

=4+9=13
Test case
4: A possible pair
(A,B) such that
A
2
+B
2
=N is
(0,2). Here,
0
