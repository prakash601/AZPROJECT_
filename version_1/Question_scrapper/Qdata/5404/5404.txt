There are
N players standing in a line, indexed
1 to
N from left to right. They all play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player has already decided which move they want to play. You are given this information as a string
S of length
N, i.e,
S
i
is equal to
R if player
i will play Rock.
S
i
is equal to
P if player
i will play Paper.
S
i
is equal to
S if player
i will play Scissors.
Let
W(i,j) denote the move played by the winner if players
i,i+1,…,j compete in order from left to right. That is,
First, players
i and
i+1 play a game
The winner of this game plays against player
i+2
The winner of the second game plays against player
i+3
⋮
The winner of the first
j−i−1 games plays against player
j, and the move played by the winner of this game is declared to be
W(i,j).
If
i=j, then player
i is considered to be the winner and
W(i,i)=S
i
.
Your task is to find the value of
W(i,N) for all
i from
1 to
N.
Note : If a person with index
i and index
j (
i<j) play against each other, then:
If
S
i

=S
j
, the winner is decided by classical rules, i.e, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
If
S
i
=S
j
, the player with lower index (in this case,
i) wins.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of players.
The second line of each test case contains the string
S of length
N, denoting the moves chosen by the players.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing a string of length
N, whose
i-th character is
W(i,N).

Explanation:
Test Case 1.
W(1,1)=S as there is only one player.
Test Case 2.
For
W(1,4) the game is played as follows :
Player
1 and
2 compete, player
1 wins.
Player
1 and
3 compete, player
1 wins.
Player
1 and
4 compete, player
4 wins.
Hence, we print
W(1,4)=S
4
=R
For
W(3,4) the game is played as follows :
Player
3 and
4 compete, player
3 wins.
Hence, we print
W(3,4)=S
