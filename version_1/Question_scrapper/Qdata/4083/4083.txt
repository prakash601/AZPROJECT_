You are given a $sorted$ list $A$ of size $N$.You have to make a new list $B$ such that $B[i]$ is equal to the number of elements $strictly$ $greater$ than $A[i]$ in the list $A$.
Print the $new$ $list$.
Input
The first line consists of $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of one integer denoting $N$, where $N$ is the size of the list given to you.
Second line of each test case contains the list given to you containing $N$ elements.
Output
For each test case print the list in a single line and the elements of the list should be separated by $space$.
Print the answer to $each$ test case in a $new$ $line$.
Constraints
$1 \le T \le 100$ , where $T$ is the number of test cases.
$1 \le N \le 100$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the list.
$1 \le A[i] \le 1000000$ ,where $A[i]$ is the $ith$ element in the list given to you.
Subtasks
$15$ $points$: All the elements in the list given to you are distinct.
$35$ $points$: Original constraints: Elements can be repeated in the list.

1 2 4 4
5
1 2 2 2 2
3 2 0 0
4 0 0 0 0
Explanation:
The explanation for test case 1 of sample input :
The first element in the new list is 3 since the first element in the previous list was 1, and there are three elements which are strictly greater than 1, that is 2, 4 and 4.
The second element in the new list is 2 since the second element in the previous list was 2, and there are two elements which are strictly greater than 2, that is 4 and 4.
The third and fourth element in the new list is 0 since third and fourth element in the previous list was 4 and there are no elements which are strictly greater than them.
