You are given 2 arrays
a
and
b
, both of size
n
. You can swap two elements in
b
at most once (or leave it as it is), and you are required to minimize the value
∑
i
|ai−bi|.
Find the minimum possible value of this sum.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤109
).
Output
Output the minimum value of
∑i|ai−bi|
.

Note
In the first example, we can swap the first and fifth element in array
b
, so that it becomes
[5,2,3,4,1]
.
Therefore, the minimum possible value of this sum would be
|5−5|+|4−2|+|3−3|+|2−4|+|1−1|=4
.
In the second example, we can swap the first and second elements. So, our answer would be
2
.
