You are given integers
N and
K. Construct a connected undirected unweighted graph with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N) such that there are exactly
K unordered pairs of nodes which have distance equal to the diameter of the graph (the largest distance between two nodes), or determine that no such graph exists.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
Output
For each test case:
If no valid graph exists, print a single line containing the integer
−1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer
M — the number of edges in your graph.
Then, print
M lines. Each of these lines must contain two space-separated integers
u and
v (
1≤u,v≤N;
u

=v) denoting the endpoints of one edge. All edges must be different, i.e. parallel edges are not allowed.
