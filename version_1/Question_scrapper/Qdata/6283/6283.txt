You are given a set of
N distinct points
P

,…,P
N
on a
2-D plane.
A triplet
(i,j,k) is called a holy triplet if
1≤i<j<k≤N
P
i
,
P
j
and
P
k
are non-collinear and
Any two of the points
P
i
,
P
j
and
P
k
are antipodal points of the circle that passes through all three of them.
Two points on a circle are said to be antipodal points of the circle if they are diametrically opposite to each other.
Find the total number of holy triplets.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the number of points.
Each of the next
N lines contains two space separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
, denoting the co-ordinates of
i-th point
P
i
.
Output Format
For each test case output a single line denoting the number of holy triplets.
