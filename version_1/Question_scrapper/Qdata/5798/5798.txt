Chef has started learning to solve dynamic programming problems recently. He has practiced on a lot of problems already, so he wants to try his hands on the hardest problems in this domain.
Chef only likes the interesting part of solving dynamic programming problems — specifically, he just likes to divide a problem into beautiful subproblems which consist of solving recurrences; he finds actually solving these recurrences quite boring. Since you are Chef's assistant, your job is solving this boring part for Chef.
Let's define a recurrent sequence
{dp(k)}
∞
with parametres
A,
B and
K as follows:
dp(1)=K
for
n>1,
dp(n)=A⋅dp(n−1)+B⋅
i=1
∑
n−1
dp(i)⋅dp(n−i)
Chef would like you to find
dp(N). Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains four space-separated integers
N,
K,
A and
B.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the value of
dp(N) modulo
10

+7.
Constraints

Explanation
The first four terms of this sequence are:
dp(1)=1
dp(2)=2⋅dp(1)+dp(1)⋅dp(1)=3
dp(3)=2⋅dp(2)+dp(1)⋅dp(2)+dp(2)⋅dp(1)=12
dp(4)=2⋅dp(3)+dp(1)⋅dp(3)+dp(2)⋅dp(2)+dp(3)⋅dp(1)=57
