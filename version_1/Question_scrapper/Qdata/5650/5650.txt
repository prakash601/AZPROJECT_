Let
f(n,B) be the sum of digits of the integer
n when written in base
B.
More formally, if
n=
i=0
∑
∞
a
i
B
i
where
a
i
is an integer in the range
[0,B−1], then
f(n,B)=
i=0
∑
∞
a
i
.
Given
Q queries, each consisting of three integers
n,l and
r. Find the value of
B corresponding to which
f(n,B) is minimum for all
l≤B≤r. If there are multiple such values, you can print any of them.
Input Format
The first line contains in single integer
Q, the number of queries
Each of the next Q lines contain three space separated integers
n,l and
r respectively.
Output Format
For each query (n l r), print the value of base
B which lies within
[l,r] such that
f(n,B) is minimum.

Subtask #1 (50 points): original constraints
This problem is worth a total of 50 points and is meant to be complementary to the problem "MNDIGSM2" (also worth 50 points) which is very similar to this problem, but has slightly different constraints.

Explanation:
To compute
f(n,B), first write the integer
n in the form
a
0
+a
1
B+a
2
B
2
+… such that
0≤a
i
<B and
a
i
is an integer. It can be shown that such a representation is unique. The sum of the digits is then
i=0
∑
∞
a
i
(to be computed in base 10).
For example to compute
f(216,2), observe that
216=2
7
+2
6
+2
4
+2
3
, and so the sum of digits is
1+1+1+1=4. Similarly, to compute
f(216,100), write
216 as
2∗100+16 and so the sum of digits is
2+16=18.
Test case
1: We have
f(216,2)=f(216,3)=4,
f(216,4)=6,
f(216,5)=8,
f(216,6)=1 and finally
f(216,7)=12. Clearly the minimum is obtained when
B=6.
Test case
2: Note that
f(256,2)=f(256,4) =
1, therefore both the answers
2 and
4 will be considered correct.
Test case
3:
f(31,3)=f(31,5)=3 and
f(31,4)=7, therefore both the answers
3 and
5 will be considered correct.
