Santa has to distribute gifts in a country which has N towns. He has to distribute exactly M gifts in town 1, M+1 in town 2, M+2 in town 3 and so on.
NOTE : Source code limit for this problem is 5KB which is much less compared to default source code limit.
In each town, you can assume that there are infinite kids. If he has 3 gifts to be distributed in town 1, he can distribute it in 3 ways: (1 gift to 3 different kids), (2 gifts to one kid and one gift to another kid) or (all 3 gifts to 1 kid). For a town, two distributions are considered different if there exists at least one positive k such that number of kids receiving k gifts is different in both the distributions.
Santa now wants to know the number of ways in which he can distribute the gifts. For the country, two distributions are different if there exists any town for which the distribution is different in both the distributions.
Input
The first line of the input contains T, the number of testcases.
The ith of the following T lines contains two integers, N and M respectively.
Output
On the ith line, output the number of ways modulo 1000000007
Constraints
1 <= T <= 1,00,000
1 <= N <= 12,500
1 <= M
The number of gifts for any town would also be <= 12,500
Example
Input:
2
1 1
3 1
Output:
1
6
Explanation
Number of ways to distribute 1 gift = 1
Number of ways to distribute 2 gifts = 2 [ 2 , (1+1)]
Number of ways to distribute 3 gifts = 3 [ 3 , 2+1 , 1+1+1 ]
So, for the first testcase, there is only 1 way to distribute it. But for the second testcase, there are 1*2*3 = 6 ways.
