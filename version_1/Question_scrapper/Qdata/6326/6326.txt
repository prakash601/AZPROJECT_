There are 10 types of viruses — one type with strength 0, one type with strength 1, and so on, up to the last type with strength 9.
Limak examines the behavior of a row of N viruses, indexed 1 through N. The initial situation is represented by a string S that consists of N digits, denoting the strengths of the viruses.
Stronger viruses will slowly defeat the weaker ones and convert them into their own type. While it's easy for a very strong virus to defeat a very weak one, the distance between them is an obstacle. Formally, we say that a virus with index x affects (tries to attack) a virus with index y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ N) if and only if:
strength(x) - strength(y) ≥ |x - y|
For example, a virus with strength 8 affects a virus with strength 5 if and only if the distance between them (the absolute difference between indices) is at most 3. Also, a virus always affects itself. Note that a virus can never affect stronger viruses.
In one second, simultaneously, each virus V is replaced with a virus whose type is the strongest among all the viruses that were affecting V at that moment.
Limak wants to know when this process will stop, i.e. when all N viruses will have the same type. It can be proved that such a situation must happen eventually. Can you help Limak and compute the number of seconds after which the process will stop?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains one string S, consisting of digits '0' through '9'. We have let N denote the length of S.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the number of seconds the process will last (after which all N viruses will have the same type).
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 3
1 ≤ N ≤ 150,000
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 50
Subtask #2 (30 points): It's guaranteed that the answer won't exceed 10.
Subtask #3 (10 points): S contains digits '0' and '1' only.
Subtask #4 (40 points): Original constraints.

Explanation:
Test case 1. In the string 555755555, the virus with index 4 (the one with strength 7) affects two viruses to the left, and two viruses to the right, i.e. viruses with indices 2, 3, 5 and 6. These four viruses will be changed to strength 7 after the first second. The new string will be 577777555.
In the next second, viruses with indices 1, 7 and 8 will be changed, and the string will become 777777775.
Finally, in the third second, the last virus will be changed to strength 7 as well. The process stops after 3 seconds in total.
Test case 2. The string changes in the following way:
311110000000000 initially
333111000000000 after 1 second
333331100000000 after 2 seconds
333333330000000 after 3 seconds
333333333330000 after 4 seconds
333333333333330 after 5 seconds
333333333333333 after 6 seconds
Test case 3. The string changes in the following way:
07788000744 initially
87888888777 after 1 second
88888888877 after 2 seconds
88888888887 after 3 seconds
88888888888 after 4 seconds
