This is an interactive task
You are given a positive integer
N. There is a tree with
N nodes numbered from
1 to
N which is hidden from you.
You can ask queries of the following format:
?
k
a
1
a
2
a
3
…a
k
where:
3≤k≤N
1≤a
i
≤N
a
i

=a
j
for all
1≤i<j≤k
The judge will return
1 if {
a
,a
,a
,…,a
} is a subsequence of
P where
P is some simple path of the tree, else it will return
0. Refer to the Sample Interaction section below for a better understanding.
You need to print all the edges of the tree (in any order). You are allowed to ask at most
N
2
queries.
Interaction
Begin the interaction by reading a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.
For each test case, first read a single integer
N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. After this, you can start making queries.
To ask a query, output
?
k
a
1
a
2
a
3
…a
k
then read a single integer
0 or
1.
To output the answer, output !, and then in the next
N−1 lines describe the edges of the tree. You can print the edges in any order.
If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
Constraints
1≤T≤10
3≤N≤100
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
100

Explanation
Test case
1: The tree has the following edges
(1,2),(2,3).
The query ? 3 2 1 3 returns
0 as it is not a subsequence of any simple path.
The query ? 3 3 2 1 returns
1 as it is a subsequence of the path
{3,2,1}.
Test case
2: The tree has the following edges
(1,2),(2,4),(2,5),(1,3).
The query ? 3 5 1 3 returns
1 as it is a subsequence of the path
{5,2,1,3}.
The query ? 4 3 1 2 4 returns
1 as it is a subsequence of the path
{3,1,2,4}.
The query ? 4 5 1 2 4 returns
0 as it is not a subsequence of any simple path.
NOTE: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.
