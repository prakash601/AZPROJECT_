Given an integer
N, construct an array
A of length
N such that:
1≤A
i
≤10
18
for all
(1≤i≤N);
There exists a subsequence of length greater than
1 such that the gcd of all elements of the subsequence is
i, for all
1≤i≤N.
More formally, for all
(1≤i≤N), there exists a subsequence
S of array
A such that the length of the subsequence is
k(2≤k≤N) and
gcd(S
1
,S
2
,…,S
k
)=i.
It can be proven that it is always possible to construct such
A under given constraints. If there exist multiple such arrays, print any.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array to be constructed.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing
N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array
A. The
i
th
of these
N integers is the
i
th
element of the array
A.
If there exist multiple such arrays, print any.
Constraints

Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: A possible array satisfying all the conditions is [2, 3, 6]:
For
i=1: Choose
S=[A
1
,A
2
,A
3
]=[2,3,6]. Thus,
gcd(2,3,6)=1.
For
i=2: Choose
S=[A
1
,A
3
]=[2,6]. Thus,
gcd(2,6)=2.
For
i=3: Choose
S=[A

]=[3,6]. Thus,
gcd(3,6)=3.
Test case
2: A possible array satisfying all the conditions is [4, 24, 10, 15]:
For
i=1: Choose
S=[4,24,10,15]. Thus,
gcd(4,24,10,15)=1.
For
i=2: Choose
S=[24,10]. Thus,
gcd(24,10)=2.
For
i=3: Choose
S=[24,15]. Thus,
gcd(24,15)=3.
For
i=4: Choose
S=[4,24]. Thus,
gcd(4,24)=4.
