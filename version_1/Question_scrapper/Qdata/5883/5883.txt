Chef's fans want to celebrate the special occasion of his birthday, so they are writing letters to him. Chef has received
N such letters from
N fans (numbered
1 through
N). Initially, for each valid
i, he assigned a beauty
B
i
to the letter from the
i-th fan (these values may even be negative, for letters that are not written well).
Now, Chef wants you to process
Q queries on these letters. There are two types of queries:
Q x y: Chef wants to choose integers
l and
r such that
1≤l≤x≤y≤r≤N and read all the letters from fans
l,l+1,…,r. Find the maximum possible value of the sum of beauties of the letters he reads.
U x v: Chef reevaluates the beauty of the letter from the
x-th fan. The new value of
B
x
becomes
v.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Each of the next
Q lines describes a query in the format described above.
Output
For each query of the first type, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum sum of beauties.
