Burenka has two pictures
a
and
b
, which are tables of the same size
n×m
. Each cell of each painting has a color — a number from
0
to
2⋅105
, and there are no repeating colors in any row or column of each of the two paintings, except color
0
.
Burenka wants to get a picture
b
from the picture
a
. To achieve her goal, Burenka can perform one of
2
operations: swap any two rows of
a
or any two of its columns. Tell Burenka if she can fulfill what she wants, and if so, tell her the sequence of actions.
The rows are numbered from
1
to
n
from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from
1
to
m
from left to right.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n⋅m≤2⋅105
) — the sizes of the table.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains
m
integers
ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,m
(
0≤ai,j≤2⋅105
) — the colors of the
i
-th row of picture
a
. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column, except color
0
.
The
i
-th of the following
n
lines contains
m
integers
bi,1,bi,2,…,bi,m
(
0≤bi,j≤2⋅105
) — the colors of the
i
-th row of picture
b
. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column, except color
0
.
Output
In the first line print the number
−1
if it is impossible to achieve what Burenka wants, otherwise print the number of actions in your solution
k
(
0≤k≤2⋅105
). It can be proved that if a solution exists, then there exists a solution where
k≤2⋅105
.
In the next
k
lines print the operations. First print the type of the operation (
1
— swap rows,
2
— columns), and then print the two indices of rows or columns to which the operation is applied.
Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
