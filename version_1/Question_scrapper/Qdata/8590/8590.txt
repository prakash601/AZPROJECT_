Tokitsukaze has a permutation
p
of length
n
.
Let's call a segment
[l,r]
beautiful if there exist
i
and
j
satisfying
pi⋅pj=max{pl,pl+1,…,pr}
, where
l≤i<j≤r
.
Now Tokitsukaze has
q
queries, in the
i
-th query she wants to know how many beautiful subsegments
[x,y]
there are in the segment
[li,ri]
(i. e.
li≤x≤y≤ri
).
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
;
1≤q≤106
) — the length of permutation
p
and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p1,p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤n
) — the permutation
p
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
) — the segment
[li,ri]
of this query.
Output
For each query, print one integer — the numbers of beautiful subsegments in the segment
[li,ri]
.
