This is an interactive problem.
There are four hidden integers
A,B,C,D (
1≤A,B,C,D≤10
9
). Your goal is to find out if
A⋅B is greater, equal to or smaller than
C⋅D.
To do that, you are allowed to ask up to
Q queries. In each query:
You should choose integers
a,b,c,d between
−10
9
and
10
9
inclusive.
Let
X=a⋅A+b⋅B+c⋅C+d⋅D.
You are told whether
X>0,
X=0 or
X<0.
Note that the scoring for subtask 2 is linear. Please read the scoring function in the section Subtasks.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
T and
Q. You should solve
T test cases.
Output Format
For each test case:
First, you should ask up to
Q queries.
To ask a query, print a line in the format "? a b c d" (without quotes), where
a,b,c,d should be integers satisfying
−10
9
≤a,b,c,d≤10
9
.
Then, you should read a single line containing one character '>', '=' or '<', denoting whether
X >
0,
X =
0 or
X <
0.
Once you have found the answer, print a line containing the character '!' followed by a space and one of the characters '>', '=' or '<' denoting your answer (e.g. '>' denotes
A⋅B>C⋅D).
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
Constraints
1≤T≤100

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points):
1≤A,B,C,D≤100
Q=200
Subtask #2 (80 points):
Q=4,000
Scoring:
If you did not find the correct answer or asked more than
Q queries in at least one test case, your score is
0.
Otherwise, let
q be the maximum number of questions you asked in a single test case.
If
q<200, you gain 80 points.
Otherwise, you gain
(4200−q)/50 points.
Note - In interactive problems, a TLE submission might sometimes get a WA verdict, with execution time displayed as -1.
Explanation:
Example case 1:
(A,B,C,D)=(10,5,3,4)
First, we ask a query with
(a,b,c,d)=(1,0,−2,0). Since
A−2C>0, the response is '>'.
Then, we ask a query with
(a,b,c,d)=(0,1,0,−1). Since
B−D>0, the response is '>' again.
Finally, we guess '>', which is correct because
10⋅5>3⋅4.
Example case 2:
(A,B,C,D)=(7,7,7,7)
First, we ask a query with
(a,b,c,d)=(2,0,−2,0). Since
2A−2C=0, the response is '='.
Then, we ask a query with
(a,b,c,d)=(5,−3,−5,3). Since
5A−3B−5C+3D=0, the response is '='.
Finally, we guess '=', which is correct because
7⋅7=7⋅7.
