VK gave a problem to Chef, but Chef is too lazy, so he asked you to solve the problem for him. The statement of the problem follows.
Consider an integer with
N digits (in decimal notation, without leading zeroes)
D
1
,D
2
,D
3
,…,D
N
. Here,
D
1
is the most significant digit and
D
N
the least significant. The weight of this integer is defined as
∑
i=2
N
(D
i
−D
i−1
).
You are given integers
N and
W. Find the number of positive integers with
N digits (without leading zeroes) and weight equal to
W. Compute this number modulo
10
9
+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
W denoting the number of digits and the required weight.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of
N-digit positive integers with weight
W, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Remember that the digits are arranged from most significant to least significant as
D
1
,D
2
. The two-digit integers with weight
3 are
14,25,36,47,58,69. For example, the weight of
14 is
D
2
−D
1
=4−1=3. We can see that there are no other possible numbers.
