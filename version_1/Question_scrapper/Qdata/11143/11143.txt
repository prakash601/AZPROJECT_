Vasya has an array
a1,a2,…,an
.
You don't know this array, but he told you
m
facts about this array. The
i
-th fact is a triple of numbers
ti
,
li
and
ri
(
0≤ti≤1,1≤li<ri≤n
) and it means:
if
ti=1
then subbarray
ali,ali+1,…,ari
is sorted in non-decreasing order;
if
ti=0
then subbarray
ali,ali+1,…,ari
is not sorted in non-decreasing order. A subarray is not sorted if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in this subarray such that the former is greater than the latter.
For example if
a=[2,1,1,3,2]
then he could give you three facts:
t1=1,l1=2,r1=4
(the subarray
[a2,a3,a4]=[1,1,3]
is sorted),
t2=0,l2=4,r2=5
(the subarray
[a4,a5]=[3,2]
is not sorted), and
t3=0,l3=3,r3=5
(the subarray
[a3,a5]=[1,3,2]
is not sorted).
You don't know the array
a
. Find any array which satisfies all the given facts.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤1000,1≤m≤1000
).
Each of the next
m
lines contains three integers
ti
,
li
and
ri
(
0≤ti≤1,1≤li<ri≤n
).
If
ti=1
then subbarray
ali,ali+1,…,ari
is sorted. Otherwise (if
ti=0
) subbarray
ali,ali+1,…,ari
is not sorted.
Output
If there is no array that satisfies these facts in only line print NO (in any letter case).
If there is a solution, print YES (in any letter case). In second line print
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — the array
a
, satisfying all the given facts. If there are multiple satisfying arrays you can print any of them.
