Mr. Chanek gives you a sequence
a
indexed from
1
to
n
. Define
f(a)
as the number of indices where
ai=i
.
You can pick an element from the current sequence and remove it, then concatenate the remaining elements together. For example, if you remove the
3
-rd element from the sequence
[4,2,3,1]
, the resulting sequence will be
[4,2,1]
.
You want to remove some elements from
a
in order to maximize
f(a)
, using zero or more operations. Find the largest possible
f(a)
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the initial length of the sequence.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤2⋅105
) — the initial sequence
a
.
Output
Output an integer denoting the largest
f(a)
that can be obtained by doing zero or more operations.

Note
In the first example,
f(A)=3
by doing the following operations.
[2,1,4,2,5,3,7]→[2,1,2,5,3,7]→[1,2,5,3,7]→[1,2,5,3]→[1,2,3]
In the second example,
f(A)=2
and no additional operation is needed.
