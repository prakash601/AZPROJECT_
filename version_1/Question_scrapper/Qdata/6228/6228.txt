To make Yalalovichik even more satisfied and happy, Jafar decided to invent Yalalovichik strings. A string is called a Yalalovichik string if the set of all of its distinct non-empty substrings is equal to the set of all of its distinct non-empty subsequences.
You are given a string
S. You need to find the number of its distinct non-empty substrings which are Yalalovichik strings.
Note: A string
A is called a subsequence of a string
B if
A can be formed by erasing some characters (possibly none) from
B. A string
A is called a substring of a string
B if it can be formed by erasing some characters (possibly none) from the beginning of
and some (possibly none) from the end of
B. Two substrings or subsequences are considered different if they are different strings.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N=∣S∣.
The second line contains the string
S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of distinct Yalalovichik substrings of
S.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤10
6
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10
6
S contains only lowercase English letters
Sample 1:

Output
1
3
xxx
3
Explanation:
Example case 1: The distinct Yalalovichik substrings are "x", "xx" and "xxx".
