Let
f([x
1
,x
2
,⋯,x
k
]) be the minimum number of subarrays such that each
x
i
belongs to exactly one subarray, and it's possible to arrange the subarrays in a way that makes
x increasing. For example,
f([5,4,1,2,3])=3 since we can divide
x into three subarrays:
[5],[4],[1,2,3] then rearrange them to
[1,2,3],[4],[5].
You are given a permutation
P of length
N. You are also given
Q queries of the form
L,R. For each query, find the value of
f([P
L
,P
L+1
,⋯,P
R
]).
Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers,
N and
Q.
The second line contains a permutation
P of length
N, represented by
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
.
The
i-th line of the next
Q lines contains two integers,
L and
R.
Output Format
For each query, print the answer to the subarray on a new line.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Divide the subarray
[5,1] into
[5] and
[1].
Test case
2: The subarray
[1,3] is already sorted, no need to divide it further
Test case
3: Divide the subarray into
[5],[1],[3],[2] and
[4].
Test case
4: Divide the subarray into
[3],[2] and
[4,6].
