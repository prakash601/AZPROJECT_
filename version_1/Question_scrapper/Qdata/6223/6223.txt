Chef and his mother are going travelling. Chef's world consists of
N cities (numbered
1 through
N) connected by
N−1 bidirectional roads such that each city can be reached from any other city using roads. For each city, we know its age — the number of years elapsed since the foundation of the city; let's denote the age of city
i by
a
i
.
First of all, Chef and his mother have to decide what city they should visit first. Suppose that Chef chooses a city
c
c
and his mother chooses a (not necessarily different) city
c
m
. The difference of their choices is the number of different bits in the binary representations of
a
c
c
and
a
c
m
.
Chef will not argue with his mother if the parity of this difference is not equal to the parity of the length of the shortest path between cities
c
c
and
c
m
(the number of roads on the shortest path between them). Find the number of ways to choose the cities
c
c
and
c
m
such that Chef avoids quarreling with his mother.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the following
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
A and
B denoting a road between cities
A and
B.
The last line contains
N space-separated integers
a

,a
2
,…,a
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs
c
c
,c
m
.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The two possible choices are
c
c
=2,c
m
=3 (their binary representations differ by one bit, the shortest path has length
2) and
c
c
=1,c
m
=2 (there are two different bits in their binary representations and the shortest path has length
1).
