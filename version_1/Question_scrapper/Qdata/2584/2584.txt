Given an array Arr of size N containing positive integers. Count number of smaller elements on right side of each array element.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {12, 1, 2, 3, 0, 11, 4}
Output: 6 1 1 1 0 1 0
Explanation: There are 6 elements right
after 12. There are 1 element right after
1. And so on.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 0 0 0 0 0
Explanation: There are 0 elements right
after 1. There are 0 elements right after
2. And so on.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function constructLowerArray() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an array of integers denoting the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
0 ≤ Arri  ≤ 108
