Raj is a math pro and number theory expert. One day, he met his age-old friend Chef. Chef claimed to be better at number theory than Raj, so Raj gave him some fuzzy problems to solve. In one of those problems, he gave Chef a
3-tuple of non-negative integers
(a
0
,b
0
,c
0
) and told Chef to convert it to another tuple
(x,y,z).
Chef may perform the following operations any number of times (including zero) on his current tuple
(a,b,c), in any order:
Choose one element of this tuple, i.e.
a,
b or
c. Either add
1 to that element or subtract
1 from it. The cost of this operation is
1.
Merge: Change the tuple to
(a−1,b−1,c+1),
(a−1,b+1,c−1) or
(a+1,b−1,c−1), i.e. add
1 to one element and subtract
1 from the other two. The cost of this operation is
0.
Split: Change the tuple to
(a−1,b+1,c+1),
(a+1,b−1,c+1) or
(a+1,b+1,c−1), i.e. subtract
1 from one element and add
1 to the other two. The cost of this operation is also
0.
After each operation, all elements of Chef's tuple must be non-negative. It is not allowed to perform an operation that would make one or more elements of this tuple negative.
Can you help Chef find the minimum cost of converting the tuple
(a
0
,b
0
,c
0
) to the tuple
(x,y,z)? It can be easily proved that it is always possible to convert any tuple of non-negative integers to any other.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers
a
0
,
b
0
,
c
0
,
x,
y and
z.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The tuple
(1,1,1) can be converted to
(2,2,2) using only three Split operations, with cost
0:
(1,1,1)→(2,0,2)→(1,1,3)→(2,2,2).
Example case 2: We can use one addition operation and one Split operation:
(1,2,3)→(1,3,3)→(2,4,2).
