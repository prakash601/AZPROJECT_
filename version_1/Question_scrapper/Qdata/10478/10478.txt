The next lecture in a high school requires two topics to be discussed. The
i
-th topic is interesting by
ai
units for the teacher and by
bi
units for the students.
The pair of topics
i
and
j
(
i<j
) is called good if
ai+aj>bi+bj
(i.e. it is more interesting for the teacher).
Your task is to find the number of good pairs of topics.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of topics.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
), where
ai
is the interestingness of the
i
-th topic for the teacher.
The third line of the input contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤109
), where
bi
is the interestingness of the
i
-th topic for the students.
Output
Print one integer — the number of good pairs of topic.
