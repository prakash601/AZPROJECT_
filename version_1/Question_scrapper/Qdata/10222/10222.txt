Polycarp wrote on the board a string
s
containing only lowercase Latin letters ('a'-'z'). This string is known for you and given in the input.
After that, he erased some letters from the string
s
, and he rewrote the remaining letters in any order. As a result, he got some new string
t
. You have to find it with some additional information.
Suppose that the string
t
has length
m
and the characters are numbered from left to right from
1
to
m
. You are given a sequence of
m
integers:
b1,b2,…,bm
, where
bi
is the sum of the distances
|i−j|
from the index
i
to all such indices
j
that
tj>ti
(consider that 'a'<'b'<...<'z'). In other words, to calculate
bi
, Polycarp finds all such indices
j
that the index
j
contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than
ti
and sums all the values
|i−j|
.
For example, if
t
= "abzb", then:
since
t1
='a', all other indices contain letters which are later in the alphabet, that is:
b1=|1−2|+|1−3|+|1−4|=1+2+3=6
;
since
t2
='b', only the index
j=3
contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is:
b2=|2−3|=1
;
since
t3
='z', then there are no indexes
j
such that
tj>ti
, thus
b3=0
;
since
t4
='b', only the index
j=3
contains the letter, which is later in the alphabet, that is:
b4=|4−3|=1
.
Thus, if
t
= "abzb", then
b=[6,1,0,1]
.
Given the string
s
and the array
b
, find any possible string
t
for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:
t
is obtained from
s
by erasing some letters (possibly zero) and then writing the rest in any order;
the array, constructed from the string
t
according to the rules above, equals to the array
b
specified in the input data.
Input
The first line contains an integer
q
(
1≤q≤100
) — the number of test cases in the test. Then
q
test cases follow.
Each test case consists of three lines:
the first line contains string
s
, which has a length from
1
to
50
and consists of lowercase English letters;
the second line contains positive integer
m
(
1≤m≤|s|
), where
|s|
is the length of the string
s
, and
m
is the length of the array
b
;
the third line contains the integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
0≤bi≤1225
).
It is guaranteed that in each test case an answer exists.
Output
Output
q
lines: the
k
-th of them should contain the answer (string
t
) to the
k
-th test case. It is guaranteed that an answer to each test case exists. If there are several answers, output any.

Note
In the first test case, such strings
t
are suitable: "aac', "aab".
In the second test case, such trings
t
are suitable: "a", "b", "c".
In the third test case, only the string
t
equals to "aba" is suitable, but the character 'b' can be from the second or third position.
