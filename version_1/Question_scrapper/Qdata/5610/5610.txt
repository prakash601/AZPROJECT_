Arya and Aryan live in a country called Nadaca. Nadaca consists of
N cities numbered
1 through
N, which are connected by some bidirectional roads. Each road has a positive (not necessarily integer) length. Arya lives in city
1 and Aryan lives in city
N.
Arya claims that for each city
v, the shortest path from city
1 to city
v has length
a
v
. Aryan does not disagree, but claims that for each city
v, the shortest path from city
N to city
v has length
b
v
. You are the wisest person they know, so they asked you to tell them if it is possible for their claims to be true, i.e. if a road network which fully satisfies their claims exists. Help them!
