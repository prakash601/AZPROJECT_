You are given an undirected graph of
N
nodes and
M
edges,
E1,E2,…EM
.
A connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus.
Find the number of pairs
(L,R)
, (
1≤L≤R≤M
) such that, if we delete all the edges except for
EL,EL+1,…ER
, the graph is a desert.
Input
The first line contains two integers
N
and
M
(
2≤N≤2.5×105
,
1≤M≤5×105
). Each of the next
M
lines contains two integers. The
i
-th line describes the
i
-th edge. It contains integers
Ui
and
Vi
, the nodes connected by the
i
-th edge (
Ei=(Ui,Vi)
). It is guaranteed that
1≤Ui,Vi≤N
and
Ui≠Vi
.
Output
The output contains one integer number – the answer.

Note
In the second example: Graphs for pairs
(1,1)
,
(2,2)
and
(3,3)
are deserts because they don't have any cycles. Graphs for pairs
(1,2)
and
(2,3)
have one cycle of length 2 so they are deserts.
