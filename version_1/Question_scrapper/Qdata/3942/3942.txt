No play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Chef during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was
w
1
kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after
M months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was
w
2
kg (
w
2
>w
1
).
Scientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between
x
1
and
x
2
kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Chef assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers
w
1
,
w
2
,
x
1
,
x
2
and
M.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the integer
1 if the result shown by the scale can be correct or
0 if it cannot.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Since the increase in Chef's weight is
2−1=1 kg and that is less than the minimum possible increase
1⋅2=2 kg, the scale must be faulty.
Example case 2: Since the increase in Chef's weight is
4−2=2 kg, which is equal to the minimum possible increase
1⋅2=2 kg, the scale is showing correct results.
Example case 3: Since the increase in Chef's weight is
8−4=4 kg, which is equal to the maximum possible increase
2⋅2=4 kg, the scale is showing correct results.
Example case 4: Since the increase in Chef's weight
8−5=3 kg lies in the interval
[1⋅2,2⋅2] kg, the scale is showing correct results.
Example case 5: Since the increase in Chef's weight is
100−1=99 kg and that is more than the maximum possible increase
2⋅2=4 kg, the weight balance must be faulty.
