Chef's team is going to participate in the legendary math battles. This time the main task of the competition is to calculate number of K-special numbers in the range [L, R] (i.e. L, L + 1, L + 2, ..., R).
A number X is said to be K-special if there exist K or more different digits, such that X is divisible by those digits and those digits are present in the decimal representation of the number. For example, number 48 is both 1 and 2 special, as it is divisible by digits 4 and 8. Note that no positive integer is divisible by number 0.
Chef asked you to help him with this task. There will be Q questions of forms L, R, K. For each of these questions, you have to tell How many K-special numbers are the range [L, R] ?".
Input
First line of the input contains an integer Q that denotes number of questions Chef was asked.
In the next Q lines follow the questions, i-th of the line will denote the i-th question represented by three space separated integer L, R, K respectively.
Output
For each question, output an integer in a separate line containing the answer of the question.
