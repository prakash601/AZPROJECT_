N integers
A

N
are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid
i,
A
i
and
A
i+1
are adjacent, and
A
1
and
A
N
are also adjacent.
We want to repeat the following operation exactly
N−1 times (until only one number remains):
Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by
a and
b.
Score
a+b penalty points.
Erase both
a and
b from the circle and insert
a+b in the space between them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
a

.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of penalty points.
