You are given a permutation
p
of
n
integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
(a permutation is an array where each element from
1
to
n
occurs exactly once).
Let's call some subsegment
p[l,r]
of this permutation special if
pl+pr=
r
max
i=l
pi
. Please calculate the number of special subsegments.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
p1
,
p2
, ...,
pn
(
1≤pi≤n
). All these integers are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print the number of special subsegments of the given permutation.
