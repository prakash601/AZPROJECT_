Explanation:
Test Case 1: After spending Rs.
22000 on the trip already, Devendra is left with Rs.
3000. The water sports cost a total of
1000+1500+700=3200. So, he does not have enough money left to try all the watersports.
Test Case 2: After spending Rs.
10000 on the trip, he is left with Rs.
3000. The water sports cost a total of
100+300+500=900. So, he has enough money to try all the watersports.
Test Case 3: After spending Rs.
5000 on the trip, he is left with Rs.
10000. The water sports cost a total of
2000+5000+3000=10000. So, he still has enough money left to try all the watersports.
