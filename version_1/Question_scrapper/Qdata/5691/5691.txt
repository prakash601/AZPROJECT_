The XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer
N is defined as a pair of integers
(A,B) such that:
1≤A≤B≤N
A⊕B=N
if there is no way to choose
A and
B satisfying the above conditions,
A=B=−1
otherwise, the value of
A should be the smallest possible
These conditions uniquely define the XPR. Next, we define a function
F(N) = the value of
B in
XPR(N), and a function
G(L,R)=
i=L
∑
R
F(i).
You are given
L and
R. Compute
G(L,R).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the value of the function
G(L,R).
