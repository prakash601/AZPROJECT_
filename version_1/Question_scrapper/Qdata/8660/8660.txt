You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. You should divide
a
into continuous non-empty subarrays (there are
2n−1
ways to do that).
Let
s=al+al+1+…+ar
. The value of a subarray
al,al+1,…,ar
is:
(r−l+1)
if
s>0
,
0
if
s=0
,
−(r−l+1)
if
s<0
.
What is the maximum sum of values you can get with a partition?
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤5⋅105
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅105
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1
,
a2
, ...,
an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅105
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum sum of values you can get with an optimal parition.

Note
Test case
1
: one optimal partition is
[1,2]
,
[−3]
.
1+2>0
so the value of
[1,2]
is
2
.
−3<0
, so the value of
[−3]
is
−1
.
2+(−1)=1
.
Test case
2
: the optimal partition is
[0,−2,3]
,
[−4]
, and the sum of values is
3+(−1)=2
.
