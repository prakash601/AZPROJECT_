You are given array
a1,a2,…,an
. Find the subsegment
al,al+1,…,ar
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) with maximum arithmetic mean
1
r−l+1
r
∑
i=l
ai
(in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).
If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.
Input
The first line contains single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
) — the array
a
.
Output
Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.
Example
input
Copy
5
6 1 6 6 0
output
Copy
2
Note
The subsegment
[3,4]
is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
