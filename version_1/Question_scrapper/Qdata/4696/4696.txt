Alice (uniformly and independently) randomly picks two integers
a,b from the range
[1,10
4
], and writes down the values of
a+b,
a−b,
a⋅b and
⌊
b
a
⌋ (integer division) in some random order. Unfortunately, she forgot the values of
a and
b. You need to help her to find out if there exists two integers
a,b such that
1≤a,b≤10
4
and
a+b,
a−b,
a⋅b,
⌊
b
a
⌋ are the numbers she has written down.
If a solution exists, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of
T testcases follows.
Each testcase consists of a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers
A,B,C,D — the values written down by Alice. It is guaranteed that at most one of the four numbers
A,B,C,D will be negative.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line, separated by a space, the two numbers Alice has chosen in order (i.e, if the solution is
a=1 and
b=2, print
1 2 and not
2 1). If there does not exist any such choice of integers, print
−1 twice, separated by a space, instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: With
a=8,b=9 we obtain
8+9=17,8−9=−1,8⋅9=72,⌊
9
8
⌋=0 which are exactly the
4 numbers written down by Alice.
Test case
2: It can be shown that no choice of integers
a,b can produce the given
4 numbers.
