Chef's exam is near. There is a total of
M subjects in his syllabus. Each subject consists of several topics. However, the questions will be set only from
N topics. These topics are numbered
1 through
N. The
i
th
topic belongs to
C
i
th
subject and takes
T
i
hours to cover.
Chef has only
K hours left before the exam and wants to score the maximum marks. If Chef covers
x
1
number of topics of the
1
st
subject,
x
2
number of topics of the
2
nd
subject, and so on upto
x
M
number of topics of the
M
th
subject in the remaining
K hours, he will get a total of
⌈
2
x
1
 ⌉+⌈
2
x
2
 ⌉+⋯+⌈
2

M
 ⌉ marks in the exam. So Chef chooses the topics optimally.
Determine the maximum possible marks Chef can score in the exam.
Note:
⌈x⌉ : Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to
x (i.e rounds up to the nearest integer). For example,

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef covers the
1
st
and
2
nd
topic in
1+1=2 hours. Both topics belongs to
1
st
subject. He does not cover any topic of the second subject. By doing so, Chef gets
⌈
2
2
 ⌉+⌈
2
0
 ⌉ =
⌈ 1 ⌉+⌈ 0 ⌉=1 marks.
Test case
2: Chef covers the
1
st
topic which belongs to the first subject and
4
th
topic which belongs to the second subject in
1+1=2 hours. There is no topic from the third subject. So Chef gets
⌈
2
1
 ⌉+⌈
2
1
 ⌉ =
⌈ 0.5 ⌉+⌈ 0.5 ⌉=1+1=2 marks.
