There are
N students standing in a canteen queue, numbered
1 to
N from left to right. For each valid
i, the
i-th student has a height
h
i
.
Two students
i and
j can see each other if there are no taller students standing between them. Formally, students
i and
j (
i<j) can see each other if for each integer
k (
i<k<j),
h

For each valid
i, determine the number
c
i
of students that have the same height as student
i and can be seen by student
i.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains

Explanation:
Example case 1: Student
3 can see students
2 and
4, but only student
2 has the same height (height
2). On the other hand, student
3 cannot see student
5 since student
4 is taller and therefore blocking the view.
