A circular array of length
N is defined as follows:
N integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
are placed in a circle in such a way that for each
1≤i<N,
A
i
and
A
i+1
are adjacent, and
A
1
and
A
N
are also adjacent.
You are given a circular array
A of length
N. At the end of each second, the following changes are executed in the array: If
A
i
>0 then the elements which are adjacent to
A
i
, will get incremented by
1, for all
1≤i≤N.
For example, consider the array
A=[0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5].
Initially
A
4
and
A
8
are greater than zero. So after one second,
A
3
,
A
5
,
A
1
and
A
7
will get incremented by
1. Hence the array will become
A=[1,0,1,2,1,0,1,5].
After two seconds, the array becomes
A=[2,2,2,4,2,2,2,7]. Note that the value of
A
4
has become
4, because both,
A
3
and
A
5
were greater than zero after one second.
What will be the sum of elements present in the array
A after
K seconds?
Input Format
The first line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then
T testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contains 2 space separated integers
N and
K.
The second line of each testcase line contains
N integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line containing the sum of the all the elements present in the array
A after
K seconds.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: After one second, the array will become
A=[1,1,2,1,1,0]. So the sum of elements present in the array is =
1+1+2+1+1+0=6.
Test Case 2: No change will be executed in the array as
K=0. So the required sum will be equal to 3.
