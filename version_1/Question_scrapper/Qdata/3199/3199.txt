Given an array A of N integers, find any 3 elements in it such that A[i] < A[j] < A[k] and i < j < k.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,1,1,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: a sub-sequence 1 2 3 exist.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1,1,3}
Output: 0
Explanation: no such sub-sequence exist.

Your task is to complete the function find3Numbers which finds any 3 elements in it such that A[i] < A[j] < A[k] and i < j < k. You need to return them as a vector/ArrayList/array (depending on the language cpp/Java/Python), if no such element is present then return the empty vector of size 0.
Note: The output will be 1 if the sub-sequence returned by the function is present in array A or else 0. If the sub-sequence returned by the function is not in the format as mentioned then the output will be -1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 106, for each valid i
