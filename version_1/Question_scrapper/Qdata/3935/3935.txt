Rushitote went to a programming contest to distribute apples and oranges to the contestants.
He has
N apples and
M oranges, which need to be divided equally amongst the contestants. Find the maximum possible number of contestants such that:
Every contestant gets an equal number of apples; and
Every contestant gets an equal number of oranges.
Note that every fruit with Rushitote must be distributed, there cannot be any left over.
For example,
2 apples and
4 oranges can be distributed equally to two contestants, where each one receives
1 apple and
2 oranges.
However,
2 apples and
5 oranges can only be distributed equally to one contestant.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of apples and oranges, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the maximum number of contestants such that everyone receives an equal number of apples and an equal number of oranges.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There's only one apple, so distributing to more than one person is impossible.
Test case
2: As explained in the statement,
2 people can each receive
1 apple and
2 oranges.
Test case
3:
2 people can each receive
2 apples and
3 oranges. It's not possible to distribute equally to more than two people.
