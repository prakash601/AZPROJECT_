You are given some integers in the range between 1 and N. You have to answer Q queries, each query is given by number X, you have to tell whether you can write number X as a sum of allowed numbers. You can use an allowed integer zero or multiple times.
Input
The first line contains three integer numbers N and K, Q, where K denotes number of allowed integers, Q denotes number of queries. The second line containing K distinct integers Fi - allowed numbers.
Each of the next Q lines containing one integer number X.
Output
For each query output "Yes" or "No" (without quotess) in separate line.
Constraints
1 ≤ N, K, Q, X ≤ 200,000
1 ≤ Fi ≤ N
