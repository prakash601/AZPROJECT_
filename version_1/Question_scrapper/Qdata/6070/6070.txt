Consider a grid
A with dimensions
N×M, such that all elements of the grid are distinct.
A remote controlled car is present at cell
(1,1). Chef and Chefina will alternatively move the car with Chef starting first.
If it is Chef's turn, he will move the car to either right or down by
1 cell. He moves the car to the cell having larger element.
If it is Chefina's turn, she will move the car to either right or down by
1 cell. She moves the car to the cell having smaller element.
The car stops once it reaches the cell
(N,M).
Let us denote the largest element visited by the car by
A
max
and the smallest element as
A
min
. Then, the score of the grid is defined as
A
max
−A
min
.
Charlie has an array
B containing
N⋅M distinct elements. He wants to arrange the elements as a grid of size
N×M such that the score of the grid is minimised.
Help Charlie to construct any such grid.
Note: Please use fast I/O for input and pypy for python submissions.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — dimensions of the grid
A.
The next line contains
N⋅M distinct elements denoting the array
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N lines each containing
M spaced integers denoting the grid
A.
If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The car starts from
(1,1). Let us consider the moves based on the grid
[[10,5],[20,40]].
In Chef's turn, he will move the car to
(2,1) since
A
(2,1)
>A
(1,2)
.
In Chefina's turn, she will move the car to
(2,2) as it is the only available choice.
Thus, the car covers the elements
[10,20,40]. The largest element in the path is
40 while the smallest element is
10. Thus, the score is
40−10=30. It can be shown that this is the minimum possible score that can be achieved in any configuration of grid.
Test case
2: The car starts from
(1,1). Let us consider the moves based on the grid
[[2,4],[1,6],[20,9]].
In Chef's turn, he will move the car to
(1,2) since
A
(1,2)
>A
(2,1)
.
In Chefina's turn, she will move the car to
(2,2) as it is the only available choice.
In Chef's turn, he will move the car to
(3,2) as it is the only available choice.
Thus, the car covers the elements
[2,4,6,9]. The largest element in the path is
9 while the smallest element is
2. Thus, the score is
9−2=7. It can be shown that this is the minimum possible score that can be achieved in any configuration of grid.
