Given an integer
N, find a permutation
P=P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
of length
N that satisfies the following two conditions:
P
i

=i
(1≤i≤N);
Consider the set which contains
P
i
%
i for all
1≤i≤N. This set should have the minimum number of distinct integers possible, over all permutations
P.
Note that a permutation of length
N is an array containing every integer from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, an integer
N, the length of the required permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line,
N space-separated integers, denoting the permutation
P of length
N satisfying the above conditions.
Constraints
1≤T≤700
2≤N≤10

Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: The possible permutations of length
2 are
[1,2] and
[2,1]. The only permutation that satisfies the conditions is
[2,1]. The values
P
i
%
i are
[2%1,1%2]=[0,1].
Thus there are
2 distinct values of
P
i
%
i, which is the minimum possible.
Test case
2: There are
6 possible permutations of length
3 out of which
[2,3,1] satisfies the above conditions. The values
P
i
%
i are
[2%1,3%2,1%3]=[0,1,1].
Thus there are
2 distinct values of
P
i
%
i, which is the minimum possible.
