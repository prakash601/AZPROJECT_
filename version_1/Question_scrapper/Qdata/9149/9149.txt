There is a city park represented as a tree with
n
attractions as its vertices and
n−1
rails as its edges. The
i
-th attraction has happiness value
ai
.
Each rail has a color. It is either black if
ti=0
, or white if
ti=1
. Black trains only operate on a black rail track, and white trains only operate on a white rail track. If you are previously on a black train and want to ride a white train, or you are previously on a white train and want to ride a black train, you need to use
1
ticket.
The path of a tour must be a simple path — it must not visit an attraction more than once. You do not need a ticket the first time you board a train. You only have
k
tickets, meaning you can only switch train types at most
k
times. In particular, you do not need a ticket to go through a path consisting of one rail color.
Define
f(u,v)
as the sum of happiness values of the attractions in the tour
(u,v)
, which is a simple path that starts at the
u
-th attraction and ends at the
v
-th attraction. Find the sum of
f(u,v)
for all valid tours
(u,v)
(
1≤u≤v≤n
) that does not need more than
k
tickets, modulo
109+7
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
,
0≤k≤n−1
) — the number of attractions in the city park and the number of tickets you have.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤109
) — the happiness value of each attraction.
The
i
-th of the next
n−1
lines contains three integers
ui
,
vi
, and
ti
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
,
0≤ti≤1
) — an edge between vertices
ui
and
vi
with color
ti
. The given edges form a tree.
Output
Output an integer denoting the total happiness value for all valid tours
(u,v)
(
1≤u≤v≤n
), modulo
109+7
.
