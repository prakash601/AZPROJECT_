Given a Binary Tree and a target key, you need to find all the ancestors of the given target key.
1
 / \
 2 3
 / \
 4 5
 /
 7
Key: 7
Ancestor: 4 2 1
Example 1:
Input:
  1
  / \
  2 3
target = 2
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input:
  1
  / \
  2 3
  / \ / \
  4 5 6 8
  /
 7
target = 7
Output: 4 2 1
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function Ancestors() that finds all the ancestors of the key in the given binary tree.
Note:
The return type is
cpp: vector
Java: ArrayList
python: list
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(H).
Note: H is the height of the tree and this space is used implicitly for the recursion stack.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ data of node ≤ 104
