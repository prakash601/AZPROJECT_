Ada has the biggest chessboard in ChefLand. It has
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
M columns (numbered
1 through
M), where
M≥2N. As training for her upcoming world chess championship match, she placed one bishop at row
r and column
c of her board. The remaining squares of the board are empty. Now, she is calculating the number of squares that can be reached by the bishop in at most
K moves. Help Ada verify her answers.
Remember that in one move, a bishop at row
r and column
c can move to another square at row
r
′
and column
c
′
if and only if either
r+c=r
′
+c
′
or
r−c=r
′
−c
′
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers
N,
M,
r,
c and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of reachable squares.
