Given a Binary Search Tree, modify the given BST such that it is balanced and has minimum possible height.
Examples :
Input:
 30
 /
 20
 /
 10
Output:
 20
 / \
 10 30

Input:
 4
 /
 3
 /
 2
 /
 1
Output:
 3 3 2
 / \ / \ / \
 1 4 OR 2 4 OR 1 3 OR ..
 \ / \
 2 1 4

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function buildBalancedTree() which takes root as the input argument and returns the root of tree after converting the given BST into a balanced BST with minimum possible height. The driver code will print the height of the updated tree in output itself.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Here N denotes total number of nodes in given BST.

Constraints:
1<=N<=200
