Given a binary number
S containing only of 1's and 0's, find two binary numbers
A and
B such that the sum of the number of 1's in
A and
B is minimum and
A−B=S. If there are many such numbers, you can print any.
The binary number
S has some properties. See the Constraints section for details.
###Input:
The only line of input contains a single binary number
S without leading zeroes.
###Output: Print two numbers
A and
B in one line without leading zeroes. If any number is zero, just print
0.
###Constraints
2≤ number of bits in
S≤10
6
The string
S has at least 1 one and 1 zero and has exactly two parts: all 1's followed by all 0's.
Sample 1:
Input
Output
1110000
10000000 10000
Explanation:
1110000 is 112 in decimal.
10000000 is 128 in decimal. 10000 is 16 in decimal. 128 - 16 = 112. Hence the given output is valid. The sum of the number of 1's in
A and
B is 1 + 1 = 2. You can check that this cannot be decreased. Hence this is a correct answer.
