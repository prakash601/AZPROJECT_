The position of the leftmost maximum on the segment
[l;r]
of array
x=[x1,x2,…,xn]
is the smallest integer
i
such that
l≤i≤r
and
xi=max(xl,xl+1,…,xr)
.
You are given an array
a=[a1,a2,…,an]
of length
n
. Find the number of integer arrays
b=[b1,b2,…,bn]
of length
n
that satisfy the following conditions:
1≤bi≤m
for all
1≤i≤n
;
for all pairs of integers
1≤l≤r≤n
, the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment
[l;r]
of the array
b
is equal to the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment
[l;r]
of the array
a
.
Since the answer might be very large, print its remainder modulo
109+7
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤103
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n,m≤2⋅105
,
n⋅m≤106
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤m
) — the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n⋅m
over all test cases doesn't exceed
106
.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the number of arrays
b
that satisfy the conditions from the statement, modulo
109+7
.
