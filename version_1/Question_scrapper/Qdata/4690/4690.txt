An array is called lovely if the sum of product of each adjacent pair of elements is odd.
More formally, the array
S of size
M is lovely if the value
∑
i=1
M−1
(S
i
.S
i+1
) is odd.
You are given an array
A consisting of
N positive integers. Find a permutation of array
A which is lovely.
If multiple such permutations are possible, output any. If there is no lovely permutation, output -1.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The
T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, if a lovely permutation of
A is possible, print a single line containing
N integers denoting the elements of any lovely permutation of
A. Otherwise, print -1.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The sum of products of adjacent pair of elements of the given array is
1⋅2+2⋅3+3⋅4+4⋅10=2+6+12+40=60. Since this value is even, this is not a lovely permutation of the array.
A lovely permutation of the given array is
[3,1,10,2,4]. The sum of products for this array would be
3⋅1+1⋅10+10⋅2+2⋅4=41, which is odd.
Test Case
2: No permutation of the given array exists where the sum of products of adjacent pair of elements is odd. Thus, answer is
−1.
