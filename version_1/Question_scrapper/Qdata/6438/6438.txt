Kiteretsu goes to his Chemistry Lab to perform the perfect reaction. In his lab, he found
N reagents numbered
1 to
N. The
i
th
reagent has two properties -
A
i
and
B
i
.
A reaction can be performed between the reagents
i and
j only if
A
i
≤j.
If a reaction is performed between reagents
i and
j,
i⋅j amount of heat is produced. Out of this,
D⋅(B
i
⊕B
j
) is absorbed and the rest heat is released. Here,
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
More formally, in a reaction between reagents
i and
j, the heat released is given by:
H(i,j)=i⋅j−D⋅(B
i
⊕B
j
)
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: Let us choose
i=2 and
j=4. Since
A
2
≤4, a reaction can take place.
The heat released in this reaction is
2⋅4−2⋅(3⊕2)=8−2⋅1=6. It can be proven that for no other reaction, the heat released is greater than
6.
Some other reactions can take place between
(2,5),
(3,5). Note that no reaction is possible between
(3,4) as
A
3
≰4.
Test Case
2: The only possible reaction is between reagents
1 and
2. The heat released in this reaction is
1⋅2−3⋅(1⊕2)=2−3⋅3=−7.
