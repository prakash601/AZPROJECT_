Chef has two nephews who love integers
X and
Y. An integer
N is awesome if the following conditions hold:
1≤N≤10
18
(N+Y) is divisible by
X.
(N+X) is divisible by
Y.
Find any awesome integer
N. We can prove that under the given constraints, an answer always exists.
Note that you do not have to minimize the answer.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
X and
Y — favourite numbers of Chef's nephews.
Output Format
For each test case, output an awesome integer. If there are several answers, you may print any of them.

1 1
100 200
192
5
500
Explanation:
Test Case 1: In this case,
N=192 is an awesome integer because:
1≤192≤10
18
192+18=210 is divisible by
42
192+42=234 is divisible by
18
Test Case 2: We can output any positive integer
N such that
(1≤N≤10
18
) because
N+1 is divisible by
1 for all such
N.
