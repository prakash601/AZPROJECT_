Given two integers N and M, find how many permutations of 1, 2, ..., N (first N natural numbers) are there where the sum of every two adjacent numbers is at most M.
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain two integers N and M.
Output
For each test case output a single one line containing number of such permutations modulo 1000000007.
1 ≤ T ≤ 100000(105)
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000000(106)
N < M < 2*N

Explanation:
For the 1st case all permutations are: {2,3,1,4}, {3,2,1,4}, {4,1,2,3} and {4,1,3,2}.
