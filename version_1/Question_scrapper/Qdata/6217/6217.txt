There are
N chits, out of which,
A chits have
1 written on them and
B
(A+B=N) chits have
0 written on them.
Chef and Chefina are taking alternate turns. They both have a personal score which is initially set to
0. Chef starts first. On their turn, a player will:
Pick a random chit among the available chits;
Add the number written on the chit to their personal score;
Remove the chit that was picked.
Determine the expected score of Chef after all chits have been picked.
The expected score can be written in the form of
Q
P
such that
Q is not divisible by
998244353 and its guaranteed that for testcases that
Q is not a multiple of
998244353. Output the value of
P⋅Q
−1
mod
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two integers
A and
B, the number of chits having
1 and
0 respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output the expected score of Chef.
The expected score can be written in the form of
Q
P
. Output the value of
P⋅Q

mod
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is one chit with
1 written on it and
1 chit with
0 written on it. Consider all possible cases as follows:
Chef picks the chit with
1 on his turn. Thus, Chefina picks the chit with
0. The final score of Chef is
1.
Chef picks the chit with
0 on his turn. Thus, Chefina picks the chit with
1. The final score of Chef is
0.
The expected score of Chef is

Test case
2: All chits have
0 written on them. Thus, in any case, the final score would be
0. Thus, the expected score of Chef is also
0.
