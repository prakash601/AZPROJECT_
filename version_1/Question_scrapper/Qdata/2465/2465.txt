You are given a stack St. You have to reverse the stack using recursion.
Example 1:
Input:
St = {3,2,1,7,6}
Output:
{6,7,1,2,3}
Example 2:
Input:
St = {4,3,9,6}
Output:
{6,9,3,4}
Your Task:
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 <= size of the stack <= 104
-109 <= Each element of the stack <= 109
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceeds 106
Array may contain duplicate elements.
