Alice jogs everyday to keep herself fit and active. She noticed that she burns
X calories when jogging the first kilometer, and for
K>1, jogging the
K
th
kilometer burns calories equivalent to the total number of calories burned while jogging the first
K−1 kilometers.
What is the total number of calories that Alice burns after jogging for
N kilometers? The answer can be very large, so report it modulo
10
9
+7 (
1000000007).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T — the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the total number of calories that Alice burns after jogging for
N kilometers, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alice only jogs one kilometer, which burns
2 calories since
X=2.
Test case
2: Alice jogs two kilometers. The first burns
X=1 calorie, and the second also burns
1 calorie since the total amount burnt before this is
1 calorie. So, the total is
1+1=2 calories burned.
