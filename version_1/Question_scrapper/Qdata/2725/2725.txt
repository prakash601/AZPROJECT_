Given a String S. Find out which of the following basic C++ data types it represents and return it's size (in bytes).
The possible data types are:
1. Integer
2. Float
3. Double
4. Character
Example 1:
Input:
S=a
output:
1
Explanation:
The string clearly represents char 
and thus the size of char is displayed.
Example 2:
Input
S=98.45685456
Output: 
8
Explanation:
The string represents Double.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function BasicDataType() which takes String S as input parameter and displays the size (in bytes) of the datatype it represents. 

Expected Time Complexity:O(N)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=10
