You are given two positive integer sequences
a1,…,an
and
b1,…,bm
. For each
j=1,…,m
find the greatest common divisor of
a1+bj,…,an+bj
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,…,an
(
1≤ai≤1018)
.
The third line contains
m
integers
b1,…,bm
(
1≤bj≤1018)
.
Output
Print
m
integers. The
j
-th of them should be equal to GCD
(a1+bj,…,an+bj)
.
