Chef has an array
A such that
A
i
=i.
A transform on the array is performed by replacing each element of the array with the bitwise XOR of the prefix till that element. For example, if
B denotes the array after performing transform on array
A, then,
B
i
=A
1
⊕A
2
⊕…⊕A
i
. Similarly, if
C denotes the array after performing two transforms on array
A, then,
C
i
=B
1
⊕B
2
⊕…⊕B
i
.
Let
f
K
be the array obtained by performing
K transforms on the array
A. Thus,
f
X
K
denotes the
X
th
element of the
K
th
transform of the array
A.
Formally,

Given

Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers
K,X as mentioned in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the value
f
X
