You are given two sets of points
S and
T on the
xy-plane.
S contains
N points and
T contains
M points.
The points
(x
i
,y
i
) in
T have a special property - for every
1≤i<M,
x
i+1
>x
i
and
y
i+1
<y
i
.
For each point
(x,y)∈T, find the minimum Manhattan distance between
(x,y) and a point in
S. Formally, for each
(x,y)∈T, find
min
(x
i
,y
i
)∈S
(∣x−x
i
∣+∣y−y
i
∣)
Input Format
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers
N and
M - the size of
S and
T, respectively.
The next
N lines each contain two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
, representing the points of
S.
The last
M lines each contain two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
, representing the points of
T.
Output Format
For each test case, output
M lines. The
i-th of these lines should contain a single integer, the minimum Manhattan distance between the
i-th point in
T and a point in set
S.

Explanation:
The sets are
S={(0,0),(1,1)} and
T={(0,1),(1,0)}. Every point in
S is at a (Manhattan) distance of
1 from every point in
T.

Explanation:
The sets are
S={(2,2),(3,3),(3,1)} and
T={(0,3),(3,1),(5,0)}.
The point closest to
(0,3) is
(3,3), with distance
3
The point
(3,1) in
S coincides with the point
(3,1) in set
T.
The point closest to
(5,0) is
(3,1), with distance
3
The points in red are the points of the set
S and those in blue belong to set
T. The green-coloured line segments represent the Manhattan distance between two points.
