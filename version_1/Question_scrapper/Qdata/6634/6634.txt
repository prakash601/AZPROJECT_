Given n functions yi(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 and q queries. For each query, you are given an integer t and you are required to find out yi (i ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the value of yi(t).
Input
The first line is an integer T denotes the number of testcases. Each testcase starts with an integer n on a single line, the number of polynomials. The next n lines, each line describes a polynomial contains four integers: a0 a1 a2 a3. Then a line contains q, the number of queries. Each of the next q lines describes a query by a single integer .
Output
Each query, output the answer on a single line.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ n, q ≤ 105
0 ≤ t ≤ 105
0 ≤ a3 ≤ 103
0 ≤ ai ≤ 105
sum of n, q over all test cases, each is at most 3.105
Subtasks:
Subtask #1 (10 points): n, q ≤ 103
Subtask #2 (20 points): a2 = a3 = 0
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constrains
