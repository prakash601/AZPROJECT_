Given a positive integer
m
, we say that a sequence
x1,x2,…,xn
of positive integers is
m
-cute if for every index
i
such that
2≤i≤n
it holds that
xi=xi−1+xi−2+⋯+x1+ri
for some positive integer
ri
satisfying
1≤ri≤m
.
You will be given
q
queries consisting of three positive integers
a
,
b
and
m
. For each query you must determine whether or not there exists an
m
-cute sequence whose first term is
a
and whose last term is
b
. If such a sequence exists, you must additionally find an example of it.
Input
The first line contains an integer number
q
(
1≤q≤103
) — the number of queries.
Each of the following
q
lines contains three integers
a
,
b
, and
m
(
1≤a,b,m≤1014
,
a≤b
), describing a single query.
Output
For each query, if no
m
-cute sequence whose first term is
a
and whose last term is
b
exists, print
−1
.
Otherwise print an integer
k
(
1≤k≤50
), followed by
k
integers
x1,x2,…,xk
(
1≤xi≤1014
). These integers must satisfy
x1=a
,
xk=b
, and that the sequence
x1,x2,…,xk
is
m
-cute.
It can be shown that under the problem constraints, for each query either no
m
-cute sequence exists, or there exists one with at most
50
terms.
If there are multiple possible sequences, you may print any of them.
Example
input
Copy
2
5 26 2
3 9 1
output
Copy
4 5 6 13 26
-1
Note
Consider the sample. In the first query, the sequence
5,6,13,26
is valid since
6=5+1
,
13=6+5+2
and
26=13+6+5+2
have the bold values all between
1
and
2
, so the sequence is
2
-cute. Other valid sequences, such as
5,7,13,26
are also accepted.
In the second query, the only possible
1
-cute sequence starting at
3
is
3,4,8,16,…
, which does not contain
9
.
