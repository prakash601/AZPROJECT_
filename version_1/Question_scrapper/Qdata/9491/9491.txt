You are given a number
n
and an array
b1,b2,…,bn+2
, obtained according to the following algorithm:
some array
a1,a2,…,an
was guessed;
array
a
was written to array
b
, i.e.
bi=ai
(
1≤i≤n
);
The
(n+1)
-th element of the array
b
is the sum of the numbers in the array
a
, i.e.
bn+1=a1+a2+…+an
;
The
(n+2)
-th element of the array
b
was written some number
x
(
1≤x≤109
), i.e.
bn+2=x
; The
array
b
was shuffled.
For example, the array
b=[2,3,7,12,2]
it could be obtained in the following ways:
a=[2,2,3]
and
x=12
;
a=[3,2,7]
and
x=2
.
For the given array
b
, find any array
a
that could have been guessed initially.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
).
The second row of each test case contains
n+2
integers
b1,b2,…,bn+2
(
1≤bi≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output:
"-1", if the array
b
could not be obtained from any array
a
;
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
, otherwise.
If there are several arrays of
a
, you can output any.
