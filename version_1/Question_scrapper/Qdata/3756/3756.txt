Alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the supply is equal to the demand.
Alice has market data for
N time points in the form of two integer arrays
S and
D. Here,
S
i
denotes the supply at the
i
th
point of time and
D
i
denotes the demand at the
i
th
point of time, for each
1≤i≤N.
Help Alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T — the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, the length of the arrays
S and
D.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.

Explanation:
Test case
1: For
i=3 and
i=4, we have supply equal to demand, hence the market is in equilibrium.
Test case
2: For
i=1, we have supply equal to demand, hence the market is in equilibrium.
