in every century, there is a chosen one. Therefore, we do not live in a society --Last paragraphs of the IZhO 2022 Editorial
K0Kalaru47 was out with his friends and he started to tell them about a CP Task. Because the statement was informal, his friends quickly parried with "Who Asked", so here is the formal statement:
Given arrays
P and
C of size
(N+K) each, the beauty of an array
B of size
(N+K) is defined as the sum of
C
i
for all
1≤i≤(N+K) such that
B
i
=P
i
.
More formally, the beauty of an array
B is equal to
∑
i=1
∣B∣
C
i
[B
i
=P
i
]
Given an array
A of size
N such that
(1≤A
i
≤M). Your task is to insert
K elements into the array such that:
Each inserted element lies in the range
[1,M].
The beauty of the final array is maximized.
Note that, an element can be inserted at any index of the array.
You should find two values:
The maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size
(N+K).
The number of distinct arrays of size
(N+K) having the maximum beauty. Note that, two arrays
X and
Y are said to be different if there exists some index
i such that
X
i

=Y
i
. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo
MOD.
Input Format
The first line of input consists of
4 integers
N,K,M and
MOD
The second line of input contains
N space-separated integers - the array
A.
The third line of input contains
(N+K) space-separated integers - the array
P.
The fourth line of input contains
(N+K) space-separated integers - the array
C.
Output Format
Print two integers separated by a single space.
The first integer corresponds to the maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size
(N+K).
The second integer corresponds to the number of distinct arrays of size
(N+K) having the maximum beauty. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo
MOD.

Explanation:
By inserting one element, we can form the following distinct arrays :
B=[1,1,1] : The indices where
B
i
=P
i
are
{1,3}.
Thus, the beauty is
C
1
+C
3
=1+2=3.
B=[1,1,2] : The indices where
B
i
=P
i
are
{1}.
Thus, the beauty is
C
1
=1.
B=[1,2,1] : The indices where
B
i
=P
i
are
{1,2,3}.
Thus, the beauty is
C
1
+C
2
+C
3
=1+1+2=4.
B=[2,1,1] : The indices where
B
i
=P
i
are
{3}.
Thus, the beauty is
C
3
=2.
Thus, the maximum beauty possible is
4, and the number of arrays with beauty
4 is
1 which is
[1,2,1].
