Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.
Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.
Chef decides to solve at least
10 problems every week for
4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over
4 weeks as
P
1
,P
2
,P
3
, and
P

Input
Output
2 3 1 10
1
Explanation:
Chef solved at least
10 problems in the fourth week. He failed to solve at least

Output
1 1 1 1
0
Explanation:
Chef was not able to solve at least
10 problems in any of the four weeks. Hence, the number of weeks in which Chef met his target is
