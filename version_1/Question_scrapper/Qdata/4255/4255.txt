Chef has two distinct positive integers
A and
B.
Chef wonders how many distinct values are possible for the expression
gcd(A+X,B+X), where
X can take any non-negative integer value.
Help Chef find this value.
Here,
gcd stands for Greatest Common Divisor.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two distinct space separated integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the number of distinct values of the expression
gcd(A+X,B+X), where
X can take any non-negative integer value.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case 1: Here
gcd(1+X,2+X)=1 no matter what value of
X you choose.
Test case 2:
If we take
X=0,
gcd(12,8)=4.
If we take
X=1,
gcd(13,9)=1.
If we take
X=2,
gcd(14,10)=2.
It can be shown that no other value of
gcd is possible.
