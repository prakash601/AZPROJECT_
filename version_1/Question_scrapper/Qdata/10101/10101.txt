A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Consider a permutation
p
of length
n
, we build a graph of size
n
using it as follows:
For every
1≤i≤n
, find the largest
j
such that
1≤j<i
and
pj>pi
, and add an undirected edge between node
i
and node
j
For every
1≤i≤n
, find the smallest
j
such that
i<j≤n
and
pj>pi
, and add an undirected edge between node
i
and node
j
In cases where no such
j
exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.
For clarity, consider as an example
n=4
, and
p=[3,1,4,2]
; here, the edges of the graph are
(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3)
.
A permutation
p
is cyclic if the graph built using
p
has at least one simple cycle.
Given
n
, find the number of cyclic permutations of length
n
. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo
109+7
.
Please refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle
Input
The first and only line contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤106
).
Output
Output a single integer
0≤x<109+7
, the number of cyclic permutations of length
n
modulo
109+7
.

Note
There are
16
cyclic permutations for
n=4
.
[4,2,1,3]
is one such permutation, having a cycle of length four:
4→3→2→1→4
.
Nodes
v1
,
v2
,
…
,
vk
form a simple cycle if the following conditions hold:
k≥3
.
vi≠vj
for any pair of indices
i
and
j
. (
1≤i<j≤k
)
vi
and
vi+1
share an edge for all
i
(
1≤i<k
), and
v1
and
vk
share an edge.
