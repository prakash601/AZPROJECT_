You are given a sequence of non-negative integers
A

N
. A pair
(x,y), where
1≤x<y≤N, is an inversion if
A
x

y
.
You should answer
Q queries (numbered
1 through
Q). For each valid
i, in the
i-th query:
You are given a non-negative integer
K
i
.
Consider a sequence
B

j
⊕K for each valid
j.
You should find the number of inversions in the sequence
B.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
each of the next
Q lines describes a query with a single integer
K
i
.
Output
For each test case, print
Q lines. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain a single integer ― the answer to the
i-th query.
