You are given an array
a
of
n
integers.
You want to make all elements of
a
equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:
Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of
len
to it, where
len
is the length of this segment (added integers can be different).
It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of
a
equal to zero.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100000
): the number of elements of the array.
The second line contains
n
elements of an array
a
separated by spaces:
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
Output
The output should contain six lines representing three operations.
For each operation, print two lines:
The first line contains two integers
l
,
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
): the bounds of the selected segment.
The second line contains
r−l+1
integers
bl,bl+1,…,br
(
−1018≤bi≤1018
): the numbers to add to
al,al+1,…,ar
, respectively;
bi
should be divisible by
r−l+1
.
