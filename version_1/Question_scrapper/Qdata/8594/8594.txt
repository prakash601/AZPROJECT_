Tokitsukaze has a permutation
p
of length
n
. Recall that a permutation
p
of length
n
is a sequence
p1,p2,…,pn
consisting of
n
distinct integers, each of which from
1
to
n
(
1≤pi≤n
).
She wants to know how many different indices tuples
[a,b,c,d]
(
1≤a<b<c<d≤n
) in this permutation satisfy the following two inequalities:
pa<pc
and
pb>pd
.
Note that two tuples
[a1,b1,c1,d1]
and
[a2,b2,c2,d2]
are considered to be different if
a1≠a2
or
b1≠b2
or
c1≠c2
or
d1≠d2
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
4≤n≤5000
) — the length of permutation
p
.
The second line contains
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤n
) — the permutation
p
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5000
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of different
[a,b,c,d]
tuples.

Note
In the first test case, there are
3
different
[a,b,c,d]
tuples.
p1=5
,
p2=3
,
p3=6
,
p4=1
, where
p1<p3
and
p2>p4
satisfies the inequality, so one of
[a,b,c,d]
tuples is
[1,2,3,4]
.
Similarly, other two tuples are
[1,2,3,6]
,
[2,3,5,6]
.
