The Big Billion day has arrived and Ross has
N items in his mind which he wants to purchase.
After purchasing Ross found that he has total of
M type items from 1 to
M.
Now to distinguish the items from each other he wants to arrange them in such a way that items of same type occur continuously.
For this he can select any
K (
0 <=
K <=
N ) number of items and permute them. The other
N−K elements remain untouched.
Can you help him to find the minimum value of
K for which this is possible?
###Input:
The first line of the input contains two space separated integer
N and
M
The second line contains N space-separated integers which denotes the type of items he has bought as
A
1
,
A
2
, . . . . .
A
N
.
###Output:
Print a single line containing one integer — minimum value of
K for which items of same type occurs continuously.
###Constraints
1≤N≤100000
1≤M≤20
1≤A
i
≤M
###Sample Input: 6 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
###Sample Output: 3
###EXPLANATION: One of the possible way is to select the items at indexes
1st ,
3rd and
5th. We can permute the selected items by placing the
1st ,
3rd and
5th items at
3rd ,
5th and
1st places respectively to finally get 2 2 1 1 3 3.
