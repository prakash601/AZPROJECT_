In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.
Chef has a polynomial in one variable
x with
N terms. The polynomial looks like
A
0
⋅x
0
+A
1
⋅x
1
+…+A
N−2
⋅x
N−2
+A
N−1
⋅x
N−1
where
A
i−1
denotes the coefficient of the
i
th
term
x
i−1
for all
(1≤i≤N).
Find the degree of the polynomial.
Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains of a single integer
N - the number of terms in the polynomial.
Second line of each test case contains of
N space-separated integers - the
i
th
integer
A
i−1
corresponds to the coefficient of
x
i−1
.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the degree of the polynomial.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one term
x
0
with coefficient
5. Thus, we are given a constant polynomial and the degree is
0.
Test case
2: The polynomial is
−3⋅x
0
+3⋅x
1
=−3+3⋅x. Thus, the highest power of
x with non-zero coefficient is
1.
Test case
3: The polynomial is
0⋅x
0
+0⋅x
1
+5⋅x
2
=0+0+5⋅x
2
. Thus, the highest power of
x with non-zero coefficient is
2.
Test case
4: The polynomial is
1⋅x
0
+2⋅x
1
+4⋅x
2
+0⋅x
3
=1+2⋅x+4⋅x
2
. Thus, the highest power of
x with non-zero coefficient is
2.
