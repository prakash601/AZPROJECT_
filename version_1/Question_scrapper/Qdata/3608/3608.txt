Explanation:
Test case 1: Eikooc can eat one loaf of bread per day for
100 days. Thus none of the bread expires.
Test case 2: Eikooc can eat
5 loaves of the first day and
4 loaves on the second day. Thus none of the bread expires.
Test case 3: There is no way Eikooc can consume all the loaves of bread before it expires.
