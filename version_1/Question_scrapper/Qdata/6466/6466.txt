Chef has two sequences of integers
(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
) and
(B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
).
A sequence of integers is beautiful if it contains only distinct integers. For each valid
i:
Chef wants to create a beautiful sequence
S
i
. Let's denote the length of this sequence by
L
i
and the sequence by
S
i,1
,S
i,2
,…,S
i,L
i
.
The sequence
S
i
is good if for each valid
j,
S
i,j
is either equal to
A
i+j−1
or
B
i+j−1
. Note that this means
L
i
must be at most
N−i+1.
Let's denote the maximum possible value of
L
(the maximum value such that some good sequence
S
i
with this length exists) by
M
i
.
Help Chef find the number of good sequences
S
i
that have the maximum possible length
M
i
. Since this number may be enormous, compute it modulo

+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
The third line contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these integers should be the number of possible sequences
S
i
modulo
10

+7.
