Write a program to obtain length
(L) and breadth
(B) of a rectangle and check whether its area is greater or perimeter is greater or both are equal.
Input Format
First line will contain the length
(L) of the rectangle.
Second line will contain the breadth
(B) of the rectangle.
Output Format
Output 2 lines.
In the first line print "Area" if area is greater otherwise print "Peri" and if they are equal print "Eq".(Without quotes).
Constraints
1≤L≤1000
1≤B≤1000
Sample 1:
Input
Output
1
2
Peri
6
Explanation:
Area = 1 * 2 = 2
Peri = 2 * (1 + 2) = 6
Since Perimeter is greater than Area, hence the output is :
Peri
6
