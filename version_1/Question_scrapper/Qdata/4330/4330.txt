For an array
A of length
N, let
F(A) denote the sum of the product of all the subarrays of
A. Formally,
F(A)=
L=1
∑
N
R=L
∑
N
(
i=L
∏
R
A
i
)
For example, let
A=[1,0,1], then there are
6 possible subarrays:
Subarray
[1,1] has product
=1
Subarray
[1,2] has product
=0
Subarray
[1,3] has product
=0
Subarray
[2,2] has product
=0
Subarray
[2,3] has product
=0
Subarray
[3,3] has product
=1
So
F(A)=1+1=2.
Given a binary array
A, determine the value of
F(A).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the length of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the value of
F(A).
