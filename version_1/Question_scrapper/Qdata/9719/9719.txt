Monocarp had a sequence
a
consisting of
n+m
integers
a1,a2,…,an+m
. He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue;
n
elements were painted red, all other
m
elements were painted blue.
After painting the elements, he has written two sequences
r1,r2,…,rn
and
b1,b2,…,bm
. The sequence
r
consisted of all red elements of
a
in the order they appeared in
a
; similarly, the sequence
b
consisted of all blue elements of
a
in the order they appeared in
a
as well.
Unfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences
r
and
b
. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of
f(a)=max(0,a1,(a1+a2),(a1+a2+a3),…,(a1+a2+a3+⋯+an+m))
Help Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of
f(a)
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
).
The second line contains
n
integers
r1,r2,…,rn
(
−100≤ri≤100
).
The third line contains one integer
m
(
1≤m≤100
).
The fourth line contains
m
integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
−100≤bi≤100
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible value of
f(a)
.

Note
In the explanations for the sample test cases, red elements are marked as bold.
In the first test case, one of the possible sequences
a
is
[6,2,−5,3,7,−3,−4]
.
In the second test case, one of the possible sequences
a
is
[10,1,−3,1,2,2]
.
In the third test case, one of the possible sequences
a
is
[−1,−1,−2,−3,−2,−4,−5,−3,−4,−5]
.
In the fourth test case, one of the possible sequences
a
is
[0,0]
.
