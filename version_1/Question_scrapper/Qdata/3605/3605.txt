Explanation:
Test case
1: The cost of the disposable masks will be
10⋅100=1000, while the cost of the cloth masks will be
100⋅10=1000. Since the price is equal and Chef is eco-friendly, Chef will buy the cloth masks.
Test case
2: The cost of the disposable masks will be
9⋅100=900, while the cost of the cloth masks will be
100⋅10=1000. Since the price of disposable masks is less, Chef will buy the disposable masks.
Test case
3: The cost of the disposable masks will be
88⋅100=8800, while the cost of the cloth masks will be
99⋅10=990. Since the price of the cloth masks is less, Chef will buy the cloth masks.
Test case
4: The cost of the disposable masks will be
1⋅100=100, while the cost of the cloth masks will be
11⋅10=110. Since the price of disposable masks is less, Chef will buy the disposable masks.
