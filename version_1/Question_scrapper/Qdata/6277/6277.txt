Chef is given a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Chef considers a contiguous subsequence
A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
(where
1≤l≤r≤N) fruitful if it satisfies the condition
∣A
l
−A
r
∣=max(A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
)−min(A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
).
Please help Chef find the number of fruitful contiguous subsequences of the sequence
A.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of fruitful contiguous subsequences.

Explanation:
Example case 1: All contiguous subsequences, i.e.
[1],
[2],
[3],
[1,2],
[2,3] and
[1,2,3], are fruitful.
