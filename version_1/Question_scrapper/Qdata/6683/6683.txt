Chef has a combination lock with
N wheels (numbered
1 through
N). For each valid
i, on the
i-th wheel, the integers from
0 to
A
i
(inclusive) are written in ascending order (
0 and
A
i
are also adjacent). Initially, one value on each wheel is selected uniformly randomly and independently.
The lock operates in a very peculiar way: it opens when there is at least one wheel where either
0 or the largest value on that wheel is selected. Chef wants to open the lock using the smallest possible number of operations; in one operation, he may choose one wheel and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise by
1 unit (i.e. select a value that is adjacent to the previously selected value on that wheel).
Find the expected value of the number of operations which Chef needs to perform to open the lock.
The expected number of operations can be represented as a fraction
Q
P
, where
P is a non-negative integer and
Q a positive integer coprime with
998,244,353. You should calculate
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353, where
Q
−1
denotes the multiplicative inverse of
Q modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
998,244,353.
