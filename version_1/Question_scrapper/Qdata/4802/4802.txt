You are given an undirected graph with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). For each valid
i, the
i-th node has a weight
W
i
. Also, for each pair of nodes
i and
j, there is an edge connecting these nodes if
j−i

Find the number of connected components in this graph.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
W

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the number of connected components in the graph.

Explanation:
Example case 1: For
i=1 and
j=2, we have
2−1=2−1, therefore there are no edges in the graph and there are two connected components.
Example case 2: For
i=1 and
j=2, we have
2−1

=1−2, therefore there is an edge between
1 and
2, the graph is connected, so there is only one connected component.
