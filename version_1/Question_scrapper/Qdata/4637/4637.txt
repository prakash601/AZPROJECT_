An
N-bonacci sequence is an infinite sequence
F
1
,F
2
,… such that for each integer
i>N,
F
i
is calculated as
f(F
i−1
,F
i−2
,…,F
i−N
), where
f is some function. A XOR
N-bonacci sequence is an
N-bonacci sequence for which
f(F
i−1
,F
i−2
,…,F
i−N
)=F
i−1
⊕F
i−2
⊕…⊕F
i−N
, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Recently, Chef has found an interesting sequence
S
1
,S
2
,…, which is obtained from prefix XORs of a XOR
N-bonacci sequence
F
1
,F
2
,…. Formally, for each positive integer
i,
S
i
=F
1
⊕F
2
⊕…⊕F
i
. You are given the first
N elements of the sequence
F, which uniquely determine the entire sequence
S.
You should answer
Q queries. In each query, you are given an index
k and you should calculate
S
k
. It is guaranteed that in each query,
S
k
does not exceed
10
50
.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
F
1
,F

,…,F
N
.
The following
Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer
k.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer
S
k
.
