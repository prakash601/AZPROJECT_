You are given a positive integer
N. Consider the sequence
S=(1,2,…,N). You should choose two elements of this sequence and swap them.
A swap is nice if there is an integer
M (
1≤M<N) such that the sum of the first
M elements of the resulting sequence is equal to the sum of its last
N−M elements. Find the number of nice swaps.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of nice swaps.
