You want to partition the set
S={1,2,…,N} into
K sets
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
K
, such that
∣S
i
∣≥2, and the sum of elements in each
S
i
is odd.
Is it possible to do so?
Note 1: Partitioning the set
S={1,2,…,N} into
K sets
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
K
means that every element of
S should be in exactly one of the sets
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
K
, and
S
i
⊆S, for all
1≤i≤K.
Note 2:
∣A∣ denotes the number of elements in the set
A.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers,
N and
K.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if you can partition the set satisfying the requirements. Otherwise, output NO.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is no way you can partition
{1,2,3,4,5} into
2 subsets such that each has an odd sum and each subset contains at least
2 integers.
Test case
2: One of the ways to partition is
{1,4,6,12},{2,5},{3,14},{7,10,11,13},{9,8}. The sum of elements in each subset is
23,7,17,41,17, each of which is odd and each subset contains at least
2 integers.
