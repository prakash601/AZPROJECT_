You are given an array
A of length
N.
You have to partition the elements of the array into some subsequences such that:
Each element
A
i
(1≤i≤N) belongs to exactly one subsequence.
The mean of the mean of subsequences is maximised.
Formally, let
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
K
denote
K subsequences of array
A such that each element
A
i
(1≤i≤N) belongs to exactly one subsequence
S
j
(1≤j≤K).
Let
X
j
(1≤j≤K) denote the mean of the elements of subsequence
S
j
. You need to maximise the value
K
∑
j=1

Explanation:
Test Case
1: We can partition the array in
2 ways -
({10},{20}) or
({10,20}). In both cases, mean of mean of subsequences comes out to be
15.
Test Case
2: The optimal partition is
({1,2},{3}).
Mean of first subsequence
=
2
1+2
=1.5.
Mean of second subsequence
=
1
3
=3.
Thus, mean of mean of subsequences is
2
1.5+3
=
2
4.5
=2.25.
Test Case
3: Any partition will yield the mean of mean of subsequences as
50.
