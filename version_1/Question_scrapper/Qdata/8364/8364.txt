Oh no, on the first exam Madoka got this hard problem:
Given integer
n
and
m
pairs of integers (
vi,ui
). Also there is an array
b1,b2,…,bn
, initially filled with zeros.
Then for each index
i
, where
1≤i≤m
, perform either
bvi:=bvi−1
and
bui:=bui+1
, or
bvi:=bvi+1
and
bui:=bui−1
. Note that exactly one of these operations should be performed for every
i
.
Also there is an array
s
of length
n
consisting of
0
and
1
. And there is an array
a1,a2,…,an
, where it is guaranteed, that if
si=0
holds, then
ai=0
.
Help Madoka and determine whenever it is possible to perform operations in such way that for every
i
, where
si=1
it holds that
ai=bi
. If it possible you should also provide Madoka with a way to perform operations.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤10000,1≤m≤10000
) — the length of the array
a
and the number of pair of integers.
The second line contains
n
integers
s1,s2,…sn
(
0≤si≤1
) — the elements of the array
s
.
The third line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
|ai|≤m
) — the elements of the array
a
. It is guaranteed that if
si=0
holds, then
ai=0
.
i
-th of the following
m
lines contains two integers
vi
and
ui
(
1≤vi,ui≤n,vi≠ui
) — the indexes of the elements of the array
b
to which the operation is performed. It is also guaranteed that there are no two indices
i
and
j
, where
1≤i<j≤m
, such that
(vi,ui)=(vj,uj)
or
(vi,ui)=(uj,vj)
.
Output
In the first line print "YES" if it is possible to perform operations in the required way, and "NO" otherwise.
You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as positive answer).
In case you printed "YES", print
m
pairs of integers. If for pair
(vi,ui)
we should perform
bvi:=bvi−1
and
bui:=bui+1
, print
(vi,ui)
. Otherwise print
(ui,vi)
. If there are multiple ways to get the correct answer, you can print any of them.
You can print pairs in any order.

Note
In the first example, the array
b
will change as follows:
[0,0,0,0,0]→[−1,0,0,1,0]→[−2,0,0,1,1]→[−2,0,1,0,1]→[−2,0,2,0,0]→[−2,0,2,1,−1]
.
ai=bi
for all indices
i
from
1
to
5
.
In the second example, it is enough for us that
b2=1
at the end, since only
s2=1
.
In the third example, the operations cannot be performed as required.
