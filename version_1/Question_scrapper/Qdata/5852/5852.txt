You are given a string
S. A cyclic shift of
S is a string formed by moving a number of characters from the beginning of
S to its end (in the same order). Formally, for an integer
k (
0≤k<N), the
k-th cyclic shift is a string
R with length
N such that:
R
i
=S
i+k
for each
1≤i≤N−k
R
i
=S
i−N+k
for each
N−k+1≤i≤N
A string is palindromic if it is equal to its own reverse string.
Compute the number of palindromic cyclic shifts of the given string.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string
S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of palindromic shifts.
