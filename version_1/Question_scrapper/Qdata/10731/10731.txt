You are given a permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
.
In one move you can swap two adjacent values.
You want to perform a minimum number of moves, such that in the end there will exist a subsegment
1,2,…,k
, in other words in the end there should be an integer
i
,
1≤i≤n−k+1
such that
pi=1,pi+1=2,…,pi+k−1=k
.
Let
f(k)
be the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values
1,2,…,k
appear in the permutation.
You need to find
f(1),f(2),…,f(n)
.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤200000
): the number of elements in the permutation.
The next line of input contains
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
: given permutation (
1≤pi≤n
).
Output
Print
n
integers, the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values
1,2,…,k
appear in the permutation, for
k=1,2,…,n
.
