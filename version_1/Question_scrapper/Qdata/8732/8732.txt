Given an undirected graph
G
, we say that a neighbour ordering is an ordered list of all the neighbours of a vertex for each of the vertices of
G
. Consider a given neighbour ordering of
G
and three vertices
u
,
v
and
w
, such that
v
is a neighbor of
u
and
w
. We write
u<vw
if
u
comes after
w
in
v
's neighbor list.
A neighbour ordering is said to be good if, for each simple cycle
v1,v2,…,vc
of the graph, one of the following is satisfied:
v1<v2v3,v2<v3v4,…,vc−2<vc−1vc,vc−1<vcv1,vc<v1v2
.
v1>v2v3,v2>v3v4,…,vc−2>vc−1vc,vc−1>vcv1,vc>v1v2
.
Given a graph
G
, determine whether there exists a good neighbour ordering for it and construct one if it does.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤3⋅105
,
1≤m≤3⋅105
), the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.
The next
m
lines each contain two integers
u,v
(
0≤u,v<n
), denoting that there is an edge connecting vertices
u
and
v
. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there are no loops or multiple edges between the same vertices.
The sum of
n
and the sum of
m
for all test cases are at most
3⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output one line with YES if there is a good neighbour ordering, otherwise output one line with NO. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).
If the answer is YES, additionally output
n
lines describing a good neighbour ordering. In the
i
-th line, output the neighbours of vertex
i
in order.
If there are multiple good neigbour orderings, print any.
