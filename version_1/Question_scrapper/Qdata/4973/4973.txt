Chef defines a non-decreasing matrix as a matrix that satisfies the following rules:
For each row of the matrix, the elements of this row form a non-decreasing sequence.
For each column of the matrix, the elements of this column form a non-decreasing sequence.
Chef has a matrix A with size N × M. Each element of this matrix is either unknown (denoted by -1) or a positive integer.
Chef would like to replace each unknown element of this matrix by a positive integer in such a way that the resulting matrix is non-decreasing. Find one possible resulting matrix or determine that it's impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai1, Ai2, ..., AiM denoting the elements of the i-th row of matrix A.
Output
For each test case, if there is no way to obtain a non-decreasing matrix, print a single line containing the integer -1.
Otherwise, print N lines describing the matrix obtained by replacing all unknown elements.
For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain M space-separated integers denoting the elements of the i-th row of this matrix. Each of these elements should lie between 1 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100
1 ≤ Aij ≤ 109 or Aij = -1 for each valid i, j
