There are N stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).
Note:
Order does not matter means for n = 4 {1 2 1},{2 1 1},{1 1 2} are considered same.
  Example 1:
Input: N = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 4th stair.
They are {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}.
Example 2:
Input: N = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 5th stair.
They are {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2, 1} and
{1, 2, 2}.

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function nthStair() which takes N as input parameter and returns the total number of ways to reach at Nth stair.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)
  Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
