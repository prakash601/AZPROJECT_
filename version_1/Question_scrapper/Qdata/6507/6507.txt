Chef has a circular sequence
A of
N non-negative integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
where
A
i
and
A
i+1
are considered adjacent, and elements
A
1
and
A
N
are considered adjacent.
An operation on position
p in array
A is defined as replacing
A
p
by the bitwise OR of elements adjacent to
A
p
. Formally, an operation is defined as:
If
p=1, replace
A
1
with
A
N
∣A
2
If
1<p<N, replace
A
p
with
A
p−1
∣A
p+1
If
p=N, replace
A
N
with
A
N−1
∣A
1
Here, '|' denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Now, Chef must apply operations at each position exactly once, but he may apply the operations in any order.
Being a friend of Chef, you are required to find a sequence of operations, such that after applying all the
N operations, the bitwise OR of the resulting array is
K, or determine that no such sequence of operations exist.
###Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K denoting the number of elements, and the required bitwise OR after operations.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
###Output: For each test case, if no valid sequence of operations exist, print -1. Otherwise, print
N space-separated integers in which
i-th integer denote the position chosen in the
i-th operation. If there are multiple valid sequences of operations, you may print any valid sequence.

Explanation:
In the first test case, initially, the sequence is {2, 1, 6}.
Chef applies the operation on the
2
nd
index, so the sequence converts to {2, 6, 6}.
Next, Chef applies the operation on the
1
st
index, so the sequence converts to {6, 6, 6}.
Next, Chef applies the operation on the
3
rd
index, and this time sequence does not change.
The final sequence is {6, 6, 6}, and bitwise OR of this sequence is
6 that is equal to given
K.
