You are given an integer
N≥2. Construct string
S of length
N containing only lowercase Latin alphabets, such that
S contains at least
2 distinct characters.
The number of circular shifts of
S which are palindromes is maximum among all strings of length
N containing at least
2 distinct characters.
If there are multiple possible strings satisfying this condition, you may print any of them.
Note that a string of length
N has exactly
N circular shifts - even if some of them might be equal as strings, they are considered to be different shifts as long as they are obtained by shifting
S by different amounts. For example,
ababab has
6 circular shifts even though they only form
2 distinct strings between them (namely
ababab and
bababa).
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer
N - the length of the string to be constructed.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the string
S you construct.
Note: You will get a Wrong Answer verdict if any of the following cases occur:
The length of the output string is not equal to
N.
The output string has characters other than lowercase Latin alphabets, i.e,
[a−z].
The output string has all characters the same.
There exists a string
S
′
of length
N with at least
2 distinct characters, such that the output string has strictly fewer circular shifts being palindromes than
S
′
does.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤2⋅10

Sum of
N over all tests is atmost
2⋅10

.
S must contain only lowercase Latin alphabets.
S must contain at least
2 distinct characters.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: No palindrome is possible with a string of length
2 having
2 distinct characters.
Test Case
2: At most one circular shift of a string of length
3 can be a palindrome. For the given string
gcc, the circular shifts are
{gcc, cgc, ccg} of which only
cgc is a palindrome.
Test Case
3: At most two circular shifts of a string of length
6 can be a palindrome. For the given string
abccba, the circular shifts are
{abccba, aabccb, baabcc, cbaabc, ccbaab, bccbaa}, out of which only the first and fourth strings are palindromes.
