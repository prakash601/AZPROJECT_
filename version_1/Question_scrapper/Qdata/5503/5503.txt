Find the length of the longest contiguous segment in an array, in which if a given element
K is inserted,
K becomes the second largest element of that subarray.
###Input:
The first line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
The next line contains N space-separated integers Ai denoting the elements of the array.
###Output: Print a single line corresponding to each test case — the length of the largest segment.
###Constraints

Explanation:
If 3 is inserted at anywhere in the array, it is the second largest element. Hence the maximum length is 5.
If 5 is inserted anywhere between 1st and 4th element, it is the second largest element. The length of such subarray is 3.
