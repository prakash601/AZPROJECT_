You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
which contains pairwise distinct elements and a sequence
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
, which also contains pairwise distinct elements (but not necessarily distinct from elements of
A). For each valid
i,
1≤A
i
,B
i
≤2⋅N.
You may rotate
B as many times as you want. A rotation consists of moving the first element of the sequence to the end. Afterwards, let's define a sequence
C
1
,C
2
,…,C
N
as
C
i
=(A
i
+B
i
)%N for each valid
i.
There are
N possible sequences
C. Find the lexicographically smallest of these sequences.
Note: A sequence
x is lexicographically smaller than a different sequence
y if
x
i
< y
i
, where
i is the smallest valid index where the sequences
x and
y differ.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

The third line contains
N space-separated integers
B

N space-separated integers
C
1
,C

Explanation:
Example case 1: After rotating
B once, it becomes
(3,4,1). Now
C=(1,2,0). This is the lexicographically smallest of all possible sequences
C.
