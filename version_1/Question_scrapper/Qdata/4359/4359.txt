Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is
0.
You have a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index
i and decrease
A
i
by
i. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.
Constraints
