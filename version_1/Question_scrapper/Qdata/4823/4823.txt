You are given an array A of integers of size N. You will be given Q queries where each query is represented by two integers L, R. You have to find the gcd(Greatest Common Divisor) of the array after excluding the part from range L to R inclusive (1 Based indexing). You are guaranteed that after excluding the part of the array remaining array is non empty.
Input
First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.
For each test case, first line will contain two space separated integers N, Q.
Next line contains space separated integers denoting array .
For next Q lines, each line will contain a query denoted by two space separated integers L, R.
Output
For each query, print a single integer representing the answer of that query.
Constraints
Subtask #1: 40 points
2 ≤ T, N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Q ≤ N, 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ L, R ≤ N and L ≤ R
Subtask #2: 60 points
2 ≤ T, N ≤ 105, 1 ≤ Q ≤ N, 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ L, R ≤ N and L ≤ R
Sum of N over all the test cases will be less than or equal to 106.
Warning : Large IO(input output), please use faster method for IO.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The given array is
[2,6,9].
Query
1: On excluding the range
[1,1], the remaining elements are
[6,9]. The gcd of
6 and
9 is
3.
Query
2: On excluding the range
[2,2], the remaining elements are
[2,9]. The gcd of
2 and
9 is
1.
Query
3: On excluding the range
[2,3], the remaining elements are
[2]. The gcd of
2 is
2.
