Chef's new friend hErd gave him two functions
f and
g.
The function
f is defined over
x
(x≥1) as:
f(x)=
⎩
⎨
⎧
0,
f(
2
x
)+1,
f(⌊
2
x
⌋),
if x=1
if x is even
if x is odd
The function
g is defined over
x
(x≥1) as:
g(x)=
⎩
⎨
⎧
1,
2⋅g(
2
x
)+1,
2⋅g(⌊
2
x
⌋),
if x=1
if x is even
if x is odd
where
⌊
⌊z⌋, denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to
z.
He also gave Chef two integers
and
. Chef has to find the value of
f(x)+g(x) for
L≤x≤R.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum value of
f(x)+g(x) for
L≤x≤R.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
f(1)=0 and
g(1)=1. Hence,
f(x)+g(x)=1.
Test case
2: There are
2 possible values of
x.
x=1:
f(1)+g(1)=1
x=2:
f(2)+g(2)=(f(1)+1)+(2⋅g(1)+1)=1+3=4.
Hence the maximum value of
f(x)+g(x)=4.
