Given two positive numbers
B and
C, what is the minimum positive value of
A, such that
A⋅B is divisible by
C.
Here,
A⋅B denotes the value obtained when
A is multiplied by
B.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
B=2 and
C=4. If we choose
A=2, then
A⋅B=4, which is divisible by
4. Note that this is minimum positive value of
A, such that
A⋅B is divisible by
C.
Test case
2: We have
B=8 and
C=12. If we choose
A=3, then
A⋅B=24, which is divisible by
12. Note that this is minimum positive value of
A, such that
A⋅B is divisible by
C.
