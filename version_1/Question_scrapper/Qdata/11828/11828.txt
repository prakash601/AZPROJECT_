Being bored of exploring the Moon over and over again Wall-B decided to explore something he is made of — binary numbers. He took a binary number and decided to count how many times different substrings of length two appeared. He stored those values in
c00
,
c01
,
c10
and
c11
, representing how many times substrings 00, 01, 10 and 11 appear in the number respectively. For example:
10111100→c00=1, c01=1, c10=2, c11=3
10000→c00=3, c01=0, c10=1, c11=0
10101001→c00=1, c01=3, c10=3, c11=0
1→c00=0, c01=0, c10=0, c11=0
Wall-B noticed that there can be multiple binary numbers satisfying the same
c00
,
c01
,
c10
and
c11
constraints. Because of that he wanted to count how many binary numbers satisfy the constraints
cxy
given the interval
[A,B]
. Unfortunately, his processing power wasn't strong enough to handle large intervals he was curious about. Can you help him? Since this number can be large print it modulo
109+7
.
Input
First two lines contain two positive binary numbers
A
and
B
(
1≤A≤B<2100000
), representing the start and the end of the interval respectively. Binary numbers
A
and
B
have no leading zeroes.
Next four lines contain decimal numbers
c00
,
c01
,
c10
and
c11
(
0≤c00,c01,c10,c11≤100000
) representing the count of two-digit substrings 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively.
Output
Output one integer number representing how many binary numbers in the interval
[A,B]
satisfy the constraints mod
109+7
.

Note
Example 1: The binary numbers in the interval
[10,1001]
are
10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,1001
. Only number 110 satisfies the constraints:
c00=0,c01=0,c10=1,c11=1
.
Example 2: No number in the interval satisfies the constraints
