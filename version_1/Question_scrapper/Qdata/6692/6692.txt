A non-negative number is called "
S semi-palindromic" if it is divisible by
S and it is possible to rearrange its digits in such a way that the resulting number is palindromic. If the initial number had
D digits (without leading zeroes), consider the number obtained by rearranging to have exactly
D digits as well (leading zeroes are allowed).
Compute the number of "
S semi-palindromic" numbers smaller than
10
K
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
S and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the answer modulo
10
9
+7.
