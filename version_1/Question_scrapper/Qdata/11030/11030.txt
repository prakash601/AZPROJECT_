An array of integers
p1,p2,…,pn
is called a permutation if it contains each number from
1
to
n
exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations:
[3,1,2],[1],[1,2,3,4,5]
and
[4,3,1,2]
. The following arrays are not permutations:
[2],[1,1],[2,3,4]
.
There is a hidden permutation of length
n
.
For each index
i
, you are given
si
, which equals to the sum of all
pj
such that
j<i
and
pj<pi
. In other words,
si
is the sum of elements before the
i
-th element that are smaller than the
i
-th element.
Your task is to restore the permutation.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the size of the permutation.
The second line contains
n
integers
s1,s2,…,sn
(
0≤si≤
n(n−1)
2
).
It is guaranteed that the array
s
corresponds to a valid permutation of length
n
.
Output
Print
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
— the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Note
In the first example for each
i
there is no index
j
satisfying both conditions, hence
si
are always
0
.
In the second example for
i=2
it happens that
j=1
satisfies the conditions, so
s2=p1
.
In the third example for
i=2,3,4
only
j=1
satisfies the conditions, so
s2=s3=s4=1
. For
i=5
all
j=1,2,3,4
are possible, so
s5=p1+p2+p3+p4=10
.
