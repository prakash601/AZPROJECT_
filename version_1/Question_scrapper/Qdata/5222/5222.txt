Given an array
A consisting of
N distinct integers
(1≤A
i
≤2⋅N), we have to perform
K moves. We perform the following steps in one move:
Select an integer
X such that
1≤X≤2⋅N and
X

=A
i
for all
i
(X is not equal to any element of the current array
).
Append
X to
A.
The score of this move
=(max
1≤i≤∣A∣
A
i
)−X.
Note that the score is calculated after appending
X. Thus,
X can be the maximum element of the array as well.
For e.g. if
A=[3,1,5] and we append
X=2 to
A, then,
A becomes
[3,1,5,2] and the score of this move is
max([3,1,5,2])−2=5−2=3.
Find the maximum sum of scores we can achieve after performing exactly
K moves.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N and
K — the size of the array
A and the number of moves respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum sum of scores we can achieve after performing exactly
K moves.
It is guaranteed that it is always possible to perform
K moves under the given constraints.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: We can perform the following move:
Append
X=2. Score of this move
=max([1,3,6,2])−2=6−2=4
Hence, the maximum total score is
4.
Test Case 2: We can perform the following moves:
Append
X=4. Score of this move
=max([1,2,4])−4=4−4=0
Append
X=3. Score of this move
=max([1,2,4,3])−3=4−3=1
Hence, the maximum total score is
0+1=1.
Test Case 3: We can perform the following moves:
Append
X=4. Score of this move
=max([1,2,5,4])−4=5−4=1
Append
X=3. Score of this move
=max([1,2,5,4,3])−3=5−3=2
Hence the maximum total score is
1+2=3.
