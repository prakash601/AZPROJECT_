A positive integer
x
is called a power of two if it can be represented as
x=2y
, where
y
is a non-negative integer. So, the powers of two are
1,2,4,8,16,…
.
You are given two positive integers
n
and
k
. Your task is to represent
n
as the sum of exactly
k
powers of two.
Input
The only line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤109
,
1≤k≤2⋅105
).
Output
If it is impossible to represent
n
as the sum of
k
powers of two, print NO.
Otherwise, print YES, and then print
k
positive integers
b1,b2,…,bk
such that each of
bi
is a power of two, and
k
∑
i=1
bi=n
. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.
