Sam is a kindergartener, and there are
n
children in his group. He decided to create a team with some of his children to play "brawl:go 2".
Sam has
n
power-ups, the
i
-th has type
ai
. A child's strength is equal to the number of different types among power-ups he has.
For a team of size
k
, Sam will distribute all
n
power-ups to
k
children in such a way that each of the
k
children receives at least one power-up, and each power-up is given to someone.
For each integer
k
from
1
to
n
, find the minimum sum of strengths of a team of
k
children Sam can get.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤3⋅105
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — types of Sam's power-ups.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅105
.
Output
For every test case print
n
integers.
The
k
-th integer should be equal to the minimum sum of strengths of children in the team of size
k
that Sam can get.

Note
One of the ways to give power-ups to minimise the sum of strengths in the first test case:
k=1:{1,1,2}
k=2:{1,1},{2}
k=3:{1},{1},{2}
One of the ways to give power-ups to minimise the sum of strengths in the second test case:
k=1:{1,2,2,2,4,5}
k=2:{2,2,2,4,5},{1}
k=3:{2,2,2,5},{1},{4}
k=4:{2,2,2},{1},{4},{5}
k=5:{2,2},{1},{2},{4},{5}
k=6:{1},{2},{2},{2},{4},{5}
