You are given array A of size n. You need to find the maximum-sum sub-array with the condition that you are allowed to skip at most one element.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,-4,5}
Output: 11
Explanation: We can get maximum sum
subarray by skipping -4.
Example 2:
Input:
n = 8
A[] = {-2,-3,4,-1,-2,1,5,-3}
Output: 9
Explanation: We can get maximum sum
subarray by skipping -2 as [4,-1,1,5]
sums to 9, which is the maximum
achievable sum.
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function maxSumSubarray that take array and size as parameters and returns the maximum sum.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
-103 <= Ai<= 103
