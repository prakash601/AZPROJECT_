An integer
X is cool if it has a primitive root modulo
X.
The coolness of a non-empty set of
N distinct integers
S={x
1
,x
2
,…,x
N
} is the number of cool divisors of
∏
i=1
N
x
i
.
You are given four integers
L,
R,
A and
B. Let
S be the set containing all integers between
L and
R (inclusive). Consider all non-empty subsets of
S with size between
A and
B (inclusive). Find the sum of values of coolness of all these subsets. Since this sum can be huge, compute it modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers
L,
R,
A and
B.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the total coolness modulo
998,244,353.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We have S =
{3,4}, which has the following
3 non-empty subsets with sizes in the range
[1,2]:
{3}: coolness
2, the cool divisors are
{1,3}
{4}: coolness
3, the cool divisors are
{1,2,4}
{3,4}: coolness
5, the cool divisors are
{1,2,3,4,6}
Example case 2: There are no subsets with size in the range
[15,20], so the sum is
0.
