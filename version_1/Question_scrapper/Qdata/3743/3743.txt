In Chefland, denominations less than rupees
10 have stopped and now rupees
10 is the smallest denomination.
Suppose Chef goes to buy some item with cost not a multiple of
10, then, he will be charged the cost that is the nearest multiple of
10.
If the cost is equally distant from two nearest multiples of
10, then the cost is rounded up.
For example,
35,38,40,44 are all rounded to
40.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The cost of the item is rounded up to
40. Thus, Chef gets back
100−40=60 rupees.
Test case
2: The cost of the item is rounded down to
50. Thus, Chef gets back
100−50=50 rupees.
Test case
3: The cost of the item is
80. Thus, Chef gets back
100−80=20 rupees.
Test case
4: The cost of the item is rounded down to
10. Thus, Chef gets back
100−10=90 rupees.
