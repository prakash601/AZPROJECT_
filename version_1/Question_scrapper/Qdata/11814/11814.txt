Suppose you are given a sequence
S
of
k
pairs of integers
(a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(ak,bk)
.
You can perform the following operations on it:
Choose some position
i
and increase
ai
by
1
. That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position
j
that
i≠j
and
ai=aj
. The cost of this operation is
bi
;
Choose some position
i
and decrease
ai
by
1
. That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position
j
that
ai=aj+1
. The cost of this operation is
−bi
.
Each operation can be performed arbitrary number of times (possibly zero).
Let
f(S)
be minimum possible
x
such that there exists a sequence of operations with total cost
x
, after which all
ai
from
S
are pairwise distinct.
Now for the task itself ...
You are given a sequence
P
consisting of
n
pairs of integers
(a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(an,bn)
. All
bi
are pairwise distinct. Let
Pi
be the sequence consisting of the first
i
pairs of
P
. Your task is to calculate the values of
f(P1),f(P2),…,f(Pn)
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of pairs in sequence
P
.
Next
n
lines contain the elements of
P
:
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
ai
and
bi
(
1≤ai≤2⋅105
,
1≤bi≤n
). It is guaranteed that all values of
bi
are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print
n
integers — the
i
-th number should be equal to
f(Pi)
.
