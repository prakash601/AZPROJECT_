There is a tree with
N vertices, rooted at vertex
1. Vertex
i has the value
A
i
written on it.
Alice walks along this tree, starting at the root.
When she is at vertex
u:
If
u has no children, she stops.
Otherwise, suppose
u has
c children. She picks one of them at random (each one has a
c
1
probability of being picked), and then moves to it.
Alice also has a score, defined as follows:
Let the vertices she visited be
u
1
,u
2
,…,u
k
Then, she will forget exactly one of these
k vertices; and her score will be the bitwise xor of the remaining ones.
That is, if she chooses to forget vertex
u
i
, then her score is
A
u
1
⊕A
u
2
⊕…⊕A
u
i−1
⊕A
u
i+1
⊕…⊕A
u
k
. Here,
⊕ denotes the bitwise xor operation.
Alice wants to maximize her score, and will always choose to forget a vertex optimally to achieve this.
What is Alice's expected final score?
Find the expected value modulo
10
9
+7.
That is, the expected value can be written as
Q
P
for two integers
P,Q such that
gcd(Q,10
9
+7)=1; print the value of
P⋅Q
−1
(mod10
9
+7).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of vertices of the tree.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges. The
i
th
of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line Alice's expected final score.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There's only one final vertex Alice can reach, taking the path
1→2→3. She will choose to forget one of the
3's, for a final score of
3⊕1=2.
Test case
3: There are three leaf nodes, and Alice has a
3
1
chance of reaching each one.
If she takes the path
1→2, her score is
2 (she will forget
A
1
=1)
If she takes the path
1→2, her score is
3 (she will forget
A
1
=1)
If she takes the path
1→2, her score is
4 (she will forget
A
1
=1)
Her expected score is thus
3
1
⋅(2+3+4)=3.
