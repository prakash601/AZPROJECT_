"We’ve already come too far to end this now".
N players advance to the fifth round and the game is going to be Hopscotch. Every player has to select one mannequin before the start of the game.
Players are numbered
1 to
N. You are given an array
A of size
N, where
If
A
i
=i, the
i
th
player selects their own mannequin.
If
A
i
=j where
j

=i, the
i
th
player decides the mannequin for the
j
th
player.
If
A
i
=0, the
i
th
player hasn’t decided yet.
The VIPs want to know the number of ways that the undecided players can select mannequins such that everyone gets a mannequin, and no undecided players select their own mannequin.
It is guaranteed that every (non-zero) element in
A is unique, i.e, if
1≤i,j≤N are such that
i

=j,A
i
>0, and
A
j
>0, then
A
i

=A
j
.
Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the number of players.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers, the
i
th
of which is
A
i
as described in the statement above.
Output Format
For every test case, print one line containing the number of ways undecided players can select mannequins for others such that everyone receives a mannequin, modulo
10

Explanation:
Test Case 1: There is no undecided player, so the number of ways is
0.
Test Case 2: There are
3 ways for the last
3 players to decide mannequins, all of which are listed below:
4→2,5→4,6→5
4→5,5→4,6→2
4→5,5→2,6→4
where
a→b means that
a selects the mannequin for
b.
