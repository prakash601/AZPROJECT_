Theofanis has a string
s1s2…sn
and a character
c
. He wants to make all characters of the string equal to
c
using the minimum number of operations.
In one operation he can choose a number
x
(
1≤x≤n
) and for every position
i
, where
i
is not divisible by
x
, replace
si
with
c
.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters equal to
c
and the
x
-s that he should use in his operations.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the integer
n
(
3≤n≤3⋅105
) and a lowercase Latin letter
c
 — the length of the string
s
and the character the resulting string should consist of.
The second line of each test case contains a string
s
of lowercase Latin letters — the initial string.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, firstly print one integer
m
 — the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters equal to
c
.
Next, print
m
integers
x1,x2,…,xm
(
1≤xj≤n
) — the
x
-s that should be used in the order they are given.
It can be proved that under given constraints, an answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.

2 3
Note
Let's describe what happens in the third test case:
x1=2
: we choose all positions that are not divisible by
2
and replace them, i. e. bzyx
→
bzbx;
x2=3
: we choose all positions that are not divisible by
3
and replace them, i. e. bzbx
→
bbbb.
