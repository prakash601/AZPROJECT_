Alice has recently started playing Chess. Her current rating is
X. She noticed that when she wins a game, her rating increases by
8 points.
Can you help Alice in finding out the minimum number of games she needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to
Y?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer
T — the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
X and
Y, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of games that Alice needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to
Y.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Since Alice's current rating
X is already equal to her desired rating
Y, she doesn't need to win any game.
Test case
2: Alice's current rating is
10. After winning
1 game, her rating will become
10+8=18, which is greater than her desired rating of
17. Thus, she has to win at least
1 game.
Test case
3: Alice's current rating is
10. After winning
1 game, her rating will become
10+8=18, which is equal to her desired rating of
18. Thus, she has to win at least
1 game.
Test case
4: Alice's current rating is
10. After winning
1 game, her rating will become
18, which is less than her desired rating of
19. She will need to win one more game in order to make her rating
26, which is greater than
19. Thus, she has to win at least
2 games.
