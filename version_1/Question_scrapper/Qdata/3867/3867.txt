The fuel economy of a car is the distance which it can travel on one litre of fuel.
The base fuel economy (i.e, its fuel economy when there is only one person - the driver - in the car) of a certain car is
M kilometres per litre. It was also observed that every extra passenger in the car decreases the fuel economy by
1 kilometre per litre.
P people want to take this car for a journey. They know that the car currently has
V litres of fuel in its tank.
What is the maximum distance this car can travel under the given conditions, assuming that all
P people always stay in the car and no refuelling can be done?
Note that among the
P people is also a driver, i.e, there are exactly
P people in the car.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers
P,M, and
V - the number of people, base fuel economy, and amount of fuel present in the car, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the maximum distance that the car can travel.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: There are
5 people in the car, and its base fuel economy is
10. Thus, its effective fuel economy is
10−4=6, since there are
4 people present other than the driver. There are
20 litres of fuel in the car, so the maximum distance that can be travelled is
6⋅20=120.
Test Case
2: The effective fuel economy is
6, and the maximum distance that can be travelled is
6⋅10=60.
Test Case
3: The effective fuel economy is
3, and the maximum distance that can be travelled is
3⋅1=3.
