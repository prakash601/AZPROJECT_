Today is your birthday. You have decided to give away candies to your friends.
You have
N friends and
M candies. Suppose the
1
st
friend has
L buckets,
2
nd
has
L+1 buckets,
3
rd
has
L+2 buckets, and so on — in general, the
i
th
friend has
L+i−1 buckets.
You start distributing candies from the
N
th
friend and go towards the
1
st
friend.
For each friend, you put the maximum number of candies in each bucket such that all the buckets for that friend have an equal number of candies in them. Now, you take the remaining candies, move to the next friend, and repeat the above step.
Find the number of candies which will remain with you after visiting all your friends.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers
N,M,L — representing the number of friends, number of candies that you have, and the number of buckets with the
1
st
friend respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer representing the total number of candies left with you after distributing candies to all your friends.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are two friends. The
1
st
friend has
2 buckets and the
2
nd
friend has
3 buckets. You will give
6 candies to
2
nd
friend (
2 in each bucket). Now you are left with
2 candies, which you will give to the
1
st
friend (
1 in each bucket). You will be left with
0 candies at the end.
Test case
2: There are
3 friends and
9 candies. The
1
st
friend has
2 buckets,
2
nd
friend has
3 buckets, and
3
rd
friend has
4 buckets. You will give
8 candies to the
3
rd
friend (
2 in each bucket). Now the
2
nd
friend and
1
st
friend will get
0 candies. You will be left with
1 candy at the end.
Test case
3: There are
3 friends and
10 candies. You will give
8 candies to the
3
rd
friend (
2 in each bucket). Next, the
2
nd
friend will get
0 candies. Finally, the
1
st
friend will get
2 candies (
1 in each bucket). You will be left with
0 candies at the end.
