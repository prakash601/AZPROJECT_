Consider some positive integer
x
. Its prime factorization will be of form
x=2k1⋅3k2⋅5k3⋅…
Let's call
x
elegant if the greatest common divisor of the sequence
k1,k2,…
is equal to
1
. For example, numbers
5=51
,
12=22⋅3
,
72=23⋅32
are elegant and numbers
8=23
(
GCD=3
),
2500=22⋅54
(
GCD=2
) are not.
Count the number of elegant integers from
2
to
n
.
Each testcase contains several values of
n
, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤105
) — the number of values of
n
in the testcase.
Each of the next
T
lines contains a single integer
ni
(
2≤ni≤1018
).
Output
Print
T
lines — the
i
-th line should contain the number of elegant numbers from
2
to
ni
.

Note
Here is the list of non-elegant numbers up to
10
:
4=22,GCD=2
;
8=23,GCD=3
;
9=32,GCD=2
.
The rest have
GCD=1
