For a sequence of strings
[t1,t2,…,tm]
, let's define the function
f([t1,t2,…,tm])
as the number of different strings (including the empty string) that are subsequences of at least one string
ti
.
f([])=0
(i. e. the number of such strings for an empty sequence is
0
).
You are given a sequence of strings
[s1,s2,…,sn]
. Every string in this sequence consists of lowercase Latin letters and is sorted (i. e., each string begins with several (maybe zero) characters a, then several (maybe zero) characters b, ..., ends with several (maybe zero) characters z).
For each of
2n
subsequences of
[s1,s2,…,sn]
, calculate the value of the function
f
modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤23
) — the number of strings.
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th line contains the string
si
(
1≤|si|≤2⋅104
), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Each string
si
is sorted.
Output
Since printing up to
223
integers would be really slow, you should do the following:
For each of the
2n
subsequences (which we denote as
[si1,si2,…,sik]
), calculate
f([si1,si2,…,sik])
, take it modulo
998244353
, then multiply it by
k⋅(i1+i2+⋯+ik)
. Print the XOR of all
2n
integers you get.
The indices
i1,i2,…,ik
in the description of each subsequences are
1
-indexed (i. e. are from
1
to
n
).
