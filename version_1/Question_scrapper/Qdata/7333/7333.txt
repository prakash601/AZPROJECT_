Alice wants to clean up the mess in her room. She has
N objects in her room, numbered from
1 to
N.
Each object must be in its place. In other words,
i
th
object should be in the
i
th
location.
Currently, the object with the index
P
i
is in the
i
th
location.
To move the objects, Alice can use the spell Wingardium Leviosa. To perform it:
She needs to specify
N different indices
K
1
,K
2
,…,K
N
(1≤K
i
≤N).
The object that was at location
K
1
will move to location
K
2
, the object that was at location
K
2
will move to location
K
3
,
… , the object that was at location
K
N−1
will move to location
K
N
, the object that was at location
K
N
will move to location
1
(all of these happen simultaneously).
Your task is to help Alice move all the objects to their places by using the spell Wingardium Leviosa at most
4 times or to inform her that it is impossible.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N — the number of items.
The second line contains
N integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
—
P
i
is the index of the item that is initially located in the
i
th
location.
Output Format
If it is possible to move all the items to their places by using the spell Wingardium Leviosa at most
4 times, then:
In the first line print the number
M
(0≤M≤4) — the number of spells to be used.
Next, print
M lines of spell descriptions. A spell description is
N numbers
K
1
,K

,…,K
N
(1≤K
i
≤N), all
K
i
have to be distinct.
If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them. Note that you do not need to minimise
M.
Otherwise, print a single integer
−1.
Constraints
1≤N≤10

2 3 1
Explanation:
After the first spell, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[3,1,2].
After the second spell, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[2,3,1].
After the third spell, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[1,2,3].
Thus, all objects are at their places.
Note that all objects were in their places at the start, so
M=0 would also be a correct output.

Explanation:
After the first spell, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[2,1,3,4].
After the second spell, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[4,2,1,3].
After the third spell, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[2,3,4,1].
After the fourth operation, the indices of objects at corresponding locations becomes
[1,2,3,4].
Thus, all objects are at their places.

It is not possible to move all objects to their places in at most
4 spells.
