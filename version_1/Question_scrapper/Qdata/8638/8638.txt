You are given
n
points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis
OX
. The coordinate of the
i
-th point is
xi
. All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.
For each point
i
, you can do the following operation no more than once: take this point and move it by
1
to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate
xi
to
xi−1
or to
xi+1
). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the
i
-th point, it can be either
xi−1
,
xi
or
xi+1
.
Your task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of integers, i. e. for some integer
l
the coordinates of points should be equal to
l,l+1,…,l+n−1
.
Note that the resulting points should have distinct coordinates.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅104
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of points in the set
x
.
The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
x1<x2<…<xn
(
1≤xi≤106
), where
xi
is the coordinate of the
i
-th point.
It is guaranteed that the points are given in strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are distinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅105
(
∑n≤2⋅105
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer — if the set of points from the test case can be moved to form a consecutive segment of integers, print YES, otherwise print NO.
