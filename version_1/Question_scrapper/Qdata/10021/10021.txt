This is an interactive problem.
We hid from you a permutation
p
of length
n
, consisting of the elements from
1
to
n
. You want to guess it. To do that, you can give us 2 different indices
i
and
j
, and we will reply with
pimodpj
(remainder of division
pi
by
pj
).
We have enough patience to answer at most
2⋅n
queries, so you should fit in this constraint. Can you do it?
As a reminder, a permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
The only line of the input contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤104
) — length of the permutation.
Interaction
The interaction starts with reading
n
.
Then you are allowed to make at most
2⋅n
queries in the following way:
"? x y" (
1≤x,y≤n,x≠y
).
After each one, you should read an integer
k
, that equals
pxmodpy
.
When you have guessed the permutation, print a single line "! " (without quotes), followed by array
p
and quit.
After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see documentation for other languages.
Exit immediately after receiving "-1" and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.
Hack format
In the first line output
n
(
1≤n≤104
). In the second line print the permutation of
n
integers
p1,p2,…,pn
.
