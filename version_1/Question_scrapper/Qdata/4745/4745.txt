Chef is really interested in the XOR operation. He wants to take a sequence
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
and for each
i from
0 to
K−1 inclusive (in this order, one by one), perform the following operation:
Let's denote
a=A
i%N
and
b=A
N−(i%N)−1
before this operation.
Change
A
i%N
to
a⊕b, i.e.
a XOR
b.
Since Chef is busy, he asked you to find the final sequence he should get after performing these operations.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers ― the elements of the final sequence.
