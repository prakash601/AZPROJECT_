Given three positive integers N, L and R, find the number of non-decreasing sequences of size at least 1 and at most N, such that each element of the sequence lies between L and R, both inclusive.
Print the answer modulo 106+3.
Input
First line of input contains T, the number of the test cases.
Each of next T lines contains three space separated integers N, L and R.
Output
For each test case print the answer modulo 106+3 in a single line.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
L ≤ R

Explanation:
test #1: [4] and [5] are the two sequences.
test #2: [4], [5], [4, 4], [4, 5] and [5, 5] are the five sequences.
