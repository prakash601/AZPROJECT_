You're given an array
A of
N integers. You need to find the minimum cost of creating another array
B of
N integers with the following properties
B
i
≥0 for each
1≤i≤N
The GCD of adjacent elements of
B is equal to
1, i.e,
gcd(B
i
,B
i+1
)=1 for each
1≤i<N
The cost of creating
B is defined as follows:
i=1
∑
N
2
∣A
i
−B

∣
Find the minimum possible cost to create the array
B. Since the answer can be huge print it modulo
10
9
+7
Note: You need to minimize the value of total cost of creating the array
B, and then print this minimum value modulo
10
9
+7. For example, suppose there is a way to create the required
B with a cost of
500, and another way to do it with a cost of
10
9
+7 (which is
0(mod10
9
+7)). The output in this case would be
500 and not
0.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array
A
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum cost of creating the array
B, modulo
