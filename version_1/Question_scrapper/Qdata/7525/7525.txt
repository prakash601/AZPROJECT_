Given a (multi)set of N strings, each 8 characters long. (Note that the set may contain duplicate strings). Answer M queries. Each query has two parameters: S and d, where S is a 8 characters long string. You have to find how many strings from the original set are at edit distance of exactly d from S.
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
Input
The first line contains the integers M and N respectively.The following N lines contain one string each.These are followed by M lines each having two space separated query parameters S and d
Output
A single integer per line. Denoting the number of strings in the given set which are at an edit distance of d from the corresponding query string.
Constraints
0 ≤ d ≤ 2
1≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5
Each input string contains English alphabet (lower and upper case) and/or digits 0 to 9.
Example
Input:
1 3
abcdefgh
abcdefgi
yyyyyyyy
abcdefgq 1
Output:
2
Explanation
Both "abcdefgh" and "abcdefgi" are at an edit distance of 1 from "abcdefgq". Hence the answer is 2.
