An index
i in a permutation
P of length
N is said to be good if:
P
i
is divisible by
i
You are given
2 integers
N and
K. You need to construct a permutation
P of length
N such that exactly
K indices in that permutation are good.
If no such permutation exists, output
−1.
If multiple such permutations exist, output any.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K - the length of the permutation to be constructed and the number of good indices.
Output Format
For each test case, output any permutation satisfying the given condition.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤10

Explanation:
Test case-1: In
[1],
P
1
=1 is divisible by
1. Therefore it is a valid permutation having
1 good index.
Test case-2: In
[4,5,6,1,2,3],
P
1
=4 is divisible by
1 and
P
3
=6 is divisible by
3. Therefore it is a valid permutation having
2 good indices.
