You are given a string
S. Find the number of ways to choose an unordered pair of non-overlapping non-empty substrings of this string (let's denote them by
s
1
and
s
2
in such a way that
s
2
starts after
s
1
ends) such that their concatenation
s
1
+s
2
is a palindrome.
Two pairs
(s
1
,s
2
) and
(s
1
′
,s
2
′
) are different if
s
1
is chosen at a different position from
s
1
′
or
s
2
is chosen at a different position from
s
2
′
.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single string
S.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to choose a valid pair of substrings.
Constraints
1≤∣S∣≤1,000
S contains only lowercase English letters
Subtasks

Explanation:
The following pairs of substrings can be chosen: ("a", "a"), ("a", "ba"), ("a", "bba"), ("ab", "a"), ("ab", "ba"), ("abb", "a"), ("b", "b").
