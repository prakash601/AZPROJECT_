You are given a matrix
a
consisting of positive integers. It has
n
rows and
m
columns.
Construct a matrix
b
consisting of positive integers. It should have the same size as
a
, and the following conditions should be met:
1≤bi,j≤106
;
bi,j
is a multiple of
ai,j
;
the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells (two cells that share the same side) in
b
is equal to
k4
for some integer
k≥1
(
k
is not necessarily the same for all pairs, it is own for each pair).
We can show that the answer always exists.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n,m≤500
).
Each of the following
n
lines contains
m
integers. The
j
-th integer in the
i
-th line is
ai,j
(
1≤ai,j≤16
).
Output
The output should contain
n
lines each containing
m
integers. The
j
-th integer in the
i
-th line should be
bi,j
.

Note
In the first example, the matrix
a
can be used as the matrix
b
, because the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells is
1=14
.
In the third example:
327
is a multiple of
3
,
583
is a multiple of
11
,
408
is a multiple of
12
,
664
is a multiple of
8
;
|408−327|=34
,
|583−327|=44
,
|664−408|=44
,
|664−583|=34
.
