You are given
N points in
D-dimensional space. The
i
th
point has
D coordinates -
x
i,1
,x
i,2
,…,x
i,D
.
Consider a weighted undirected complete graph with these
N points as its vertices. Weight of the edge between points
i and
j is
∣x
i,1
−x
j,1
∣+∣x
i,2
−x
j,2
∣+…+∣x
i,D
−x
j,D
∣.
Find the weight of the maximum spanning tree of this graph.
###Input:
The first line contains two integers
N,D.
The
i-th of the next
N lines contains a description of the
i-th point. It has
D integers:
x
i,1
,x
i,2
,…,x
i,D
.
###Output: Output a single line which contains a single integer - the Maximum Spanning Tree Weight
