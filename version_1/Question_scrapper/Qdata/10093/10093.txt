Omkar is standing at the foot of Celeste mountain. The summit is
n
meters away from him, and he can see all of the mountains up to the summit, so for all
1≤j≤n
he knows that the height of the mountain at the point
j
meters away from himself is
hj
meters. It turns out that for all
j
satisfying
1≤j≤n−1
,
hj<hj+1
(meaning that heights are strictly increasing).
Suddenly, a landslide occurs! While the landslide is occurring, the following occurs: every minute, if
hj+2≤hj+1
, then one square meter of dirt will slide from position
j+1
to position
j
, so that
hj+1
is decreased by
1
and
hj
is increased by
1
. These changes occur simultaneously, so for example, if
hj+2≤hj+1
and
hj+1+2≤hj+2
for some
j
, then
hj
will be increased by
1
,
hj+2
will be decreased by
1
, and
hj+1
will be both increased and decreased by
1
, meaning that in effect
hj+1
is unchanged during that minute.
The landslide ends when there is no
j
such that
hj+2≤hj+1
. Help Omkar figure out what the values of
h1,…,hn
will be after the landslide ends. It can be proven that under the given constraints, the landslide will always end in finitely many minutes.
Note that because of the large amount of input, it is recommended that your code uses fast IO.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤106
).
The second line contains
n
integers
h1,h2,…,hn
satisfying
0≤h1<h2<⋯<hn≤1012
 — the heights.
Output
Output
n
integers, where the
j
-th integer is the value of
hj
after the landslide has stopped.

Note
Initially, the mountain has heights
2,6,7,8
.
In the first minute, we have
2+2≤6
, so
2
increases to
3
and
6
decreases to
5
, leaving
3,5,7,8
.
In the second minute, we have
3+2≤5
and
5+2≤7
, so
3
increases to
4
,
5
is unchanged, and
7
decreases to
6
, leaving
4,5,6,8
.
In the third minute, we have
6+2≤8
, so
6
increases to
7
and
8
decreases to
7
, leaving
4,5,7,7
.
In the fourth minute, we have
5+2≤7
, so
5
increases to
6
and
7
decreases to
6
, leaving
4,6,6,7
.
In the fifth minute, we have
4+2≤6
, so
4
increases to
5
and
6
decreases to
5
, leaving
5,5,6,7
.
In the sixth minute, nothing else can change so the landslide stops and our answer is
5,5,6,7
.
