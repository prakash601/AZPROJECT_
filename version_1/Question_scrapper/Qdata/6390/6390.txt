Chef Shahhoud wants to hire new chefs for his restaurant. Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami's paper "Fast Food Times".
N candidates (numbered
1 through
N) have applied for the job. There are
M traits that define how good a chef is. You are given
N strings
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
N
describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length
M. For each valid
i and
j, the
j-th character of
S
i
is '1' if the
i-th chef has the
j-th trait or '0' if this chef does not have this trait.
Shahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence
H (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence
(1,2,…,N) and hire all candidates from
H. However, the sequence
H must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of
H (let's denote them by
x and
y), candidates
x and
y have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.
Now, Shahhoud is wondering: how many such valid subsequences exist? Find this number modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10
9
+7).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains a single string
S
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid subsequences modulo
1,000,000,007.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
