Sorting arrays is traditionally associated with high-level languages. How hard can it be in FALSE? Sort the given array in non-descending order.
Input
The input consists of a single line of space-separated integers. The first number is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the size of the array. The following n numbers are the elements of the array (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100).
Output
Output space-separated elements of the sorted array.
