This is an interactive task
There is an array
P of size
N consisting of distinct integer points on a 2D plane.
P are initially hidden from you, but you can ask queries to find out information about points in
P.
To be specific, you can ask queries in the form:
? i j
where
1≤i<j≤N, and you will be provided with the square of the Euclidean distance between
and
.
More formally, define
f(i,j)=(P
i
.x−P
j
.x)
2
+(P
i
.y−P
j
.y)
2
, then the output of the query ? i j is the value of
f(i,j).
You can ask at most
3N−6 queries. Find the minimum value among all possible
f(i,j) where
1≤i<j≤N.
Interaction
Begin the interaction by reading a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.
For each test case, first read a single integer
N denoting the number of points in
P. After this, you can start making queries.
To ask a query, output ? i j (
1≤i<j≤N), then read a single integer
f(i,j).
To output the answer, output ! X, where
X is the minimum value among all possible
f(i,j) (not just the ones you made a query on). This is not considered a query. Suppose the true exact answer is
Y, then your answer will be considered correct if and only if
Y
∣X−Y∣
≤10
−6
.
If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Test case
1:
P =
[(0,0),(0,1),(2,0)].
The query ? 1 2 gives
f(1,2)=(0−0)
2
+(0−1)
2
=1
The minimum value of all
f(i,j)=1. So we output ! 1
Test case
2:
P =
[(−10

),(−10
9
,10
9
),(10
9
,−10
9
),(10
9
,10

)].
The query ? 1 4 gives
f(1,4)=(−2⋅10
9
)
2
+(−2⋅10
9
)
2
=8⋅10
18
The query ? 2 3 gives
f(2,3)=(−2⋅10
9
)
2
+(2⋅10
9
)
2
=8⋅10
18
The minimum of all
f(i,j)=4⋅10
18
. So we output ! 4000000000000000000
Since maximum relative error is
10
−6
, any integer in the range
[4⋅10
18
−4⋅10
12
,4⋅10
18
+4⋅10

] will be considered correct.
NOTE: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.
