Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values
pi
— the index of the router to which the
i
-th router was connected after being purchased (
pi<i
).
There are
n
routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the
n
-th router.
Input
The first line contains integer number
n
(
2≤n≤200000
) — the number of the routers. The following line contains
n−1
integers
p2,p3,…,pn
(
1≤pi<i
), where
pi
is equal to index of the router to which the
i
-th was connected after purchase.
Output
Print the path from the
1
-st to the
n
-th router. It starts with
1
and ends with
n
. All the elements in the path should be distinct.
