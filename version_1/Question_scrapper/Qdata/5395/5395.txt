For a set of positive integers
S, let's define
gcd(S) as the greatest integer which divides each element of
S. If
gcd(S)=1, the set
S is called coprime. For example, the set
{7,12,15} is coprime, but
{6,12,15} is not coprime, since every element of this set is divisible by
3.
Your task is to find an integer sequence
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
such that:
for each valid
i,
1≤A
i
≤10
9
A
0
,A
1
,…,A
N−1
are pairwise distinct
for each valid
i, the set
{A
i
,A
(i+1)%N
} is not coprime (
% denotes the modulo operator)
for each valid
i, the set
{A
i
,A
(i+1)%N
,A
(i+2)%N
} is coprime
It is possible that there is no solution. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case:
If there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer
−1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
A
0
,A

Explanation:
Example case 1: Let's check the answer:
gcd(6,10)=2,
gcd(10,15)=5,
gcd(15,6)=3,
gcd(6,10,15)=1. Every two cyclically consecutive numbers are not coprime, but every three cyclically consecutive numbers are coprime.
Example case 2:
gcd(374,595)=17,
gcd(595,1365)=35,
gcd(1365,868)=39,
gcd(858,374)=22
gcd(374,595,1365)=1,
gcd(595,1365,858)=1,
gcd(1365,858,374)=1,
gcd(858,374,595)=1
