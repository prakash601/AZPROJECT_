Do you know Professor Saeed? He is the algorithms professor at Damascus University. Yesterday, he gave his students hard homework (he is known for being so evil) - for a given binary string
S, they should compute the sum of
F(S,L,R) over all pairs of integers
(L,R) (
1≤L≤R≤∣S∣), where the function
F(S,L,R) is defined as follows:
Create a string
U: first, set
U=S, and for each
i (
L≤i≤R), flip the
i-th character of
U (change '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').
Then,
F(S,L,R) is the number of valid pairs
(i,i+1) such that
U
i
=U
i+1
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string
S.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
∑
1≤L≤R≤∣S∣
F(S,L,R).
