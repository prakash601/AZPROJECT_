Alice gave Bob
3 integers
N,K, and
S. Help Bob find an
S-good sequence.
A sequence
B of length
N is called
S-good if the following conditions are met:
B
i
∈{−1,0,1} for each
1≤i≤N
∑
i=1
N
B
i
⋅K
i−1
=S
If there are multiple
S-good sequences, print any of them.
If no
S-good sequence exists, print
−2.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing three space-separated integers —
N,K, and
S.
Output Format
For each test case:
If no
S-good sequence exists, print
−2.
Otherwise, output
N space-separated integers denoting the
S-good sequence.
If multiple
S-good sequences exist, you may print any of them.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
B=[1,1,1,1] and
S=15
∑
i=1
N
B
i
⋅K
i−1
=1⋅1+2⋅1+4⋅1+8⋅1=15, hence
B is an
S-good sequence.
Test case
2: We have
B=[0,0,1] and
S=36.
6
2
=36 so clearly
B is
S-good.
Test case
3: No
S-good sequence of length
5 exists.
