Colossal! — exclaimed Hawk-nose. — A programmer! That's exactly what we are looking for.
Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky. Monday starts on Saturday
Reading the book "Equations of Mathematical Magic" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation:
a−(a⊕x)−x=0
for some given
a
, where
⊕
stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some
x
, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.
Input
Each test contains several possible values of
a
and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of these values.
The following
t
lines contain the values of parameter
a
, each value is an integer from
0
to
230−1
inclusive.
Output
For each value of
a
print exactly one integer — the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of
a
appear in the input.
One can show that the number of solutions is always finite.

Note
Let's define the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Given two integers
x
and
y
, consider their binary representations (possibly with leading zeroes):
xk…x2x1x0
and
yk…y2y1y0
. Here,
xi
is the
i
-th bit of the number
x
and
yi
is the
i
-th bit of the number
y
. Let
r=x⊕y
be the result of the XOR operation of
x
and
y
. Then
r
is defined as
rk…r2r1r0
where:
ri={
1, if xi≠yi
0, if xi=yi
For the first value of the parameter, only
x=0
is a solution of the equation.
For the second value of the parameter, solutions are
x=0
and
x=2
.
