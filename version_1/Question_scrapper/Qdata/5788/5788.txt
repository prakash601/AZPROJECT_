You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You should select a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence of
A and reverse it. In other words, if you select a subsequence
A
i
1
,A
i
2
,…,A
i
K
(
1≤i
1
<…<i
K
≤N), then for each valid
j, the
i
j
-th element of the resulting sequence is equal to the
i
K+1−j
-th element of the original sequence; all other elements are the same as in the original sequence.
In the resulting sequence, you want to calculate the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence (possibly an empty sequence, with sum
0). Find its maximum possible value and a subsequence which you should select in order to obtain this maximum value. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subsequence.
The second line should contain an integer
K followed by a space and
K space-separated integers
i
