Given a positive integer
k
, two arrays are called
k
-similar if:
they are strictly increasing;
they have the same length;
all their elements are positive integers between
1
and
k
(inclusive);
they differ in exactly one position.
You are given an integer
k
, a strictly increasing array
a
and
q
queries. For each query, you are given two integers
li≤ri
. Your task is to find how many arrays
b
exist, such that
b
is
k
-similar to array
[ali,ali+1…,ari]
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
q
and
k
(
1≤n,q≤105
,
n≤k≤109
) — the length of array
a
, the number of queries and number
k
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤k
). This array is strictly increasing  —
a1<a2<…<an
.
Each of the following
q
lines contains two integers
li
,
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤n
).
Output
Print
q
lines. The
i
-th of them should contain the answer to the
i
-th query.

Note
In the first example:
In the first query there are
4
arrays that are
5
-similar to
[2,4]
:
[1,4],[3,4],[2,3],[2,5]
.
In the second query there are
3
arrays that are
5
-similar to
[4,5]
:
[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]
.
