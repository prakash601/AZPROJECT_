You are given
n
pairs of integers
(a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(an,bn)
. All of the integers in the pairs are distinct and are in the range from
1
to
2⋅n
inclusive.
Let's call a sequence of integers
x1,x2,…,x2k
good if either
x1<x2>x3<…<x2k−2>x2k−1<x2k
, or
x1>x2<x3>…>x2k−2<x2k−1>x2k
.
You need to choose a subset of distinct indices
i1,i2,…,it
and their order in a way that if you write down all numbers from the pairs in a single sequence (the sequence would be
ai1,bi1,ai2,bi2,…,ait,bit
), this sequence is good.
What is the largest subset of indices you can choose? You also need to construct the corresponding index sequence
i1,i2,…,it
.
Input
The first line contains single integer
n
(
2≤n≤3⋅105
) — the number of pairs.
Each of the next
n
lines contain two numbers —
ai
and
bi
(
1≤ai,bi≤2⋅n
) — the elements of the pairs.
It is guaranteed that all integers in the pairs are distinct, that is, every integer from
1
to
2⋅n
is mentioned exactly once.
Output
In the first line print a single integer
t
 — the number of pairs in the answer.
Then print
t
distinct integers
i1,i2,…,it
 — the indexes of pairs in the corresponding order.
