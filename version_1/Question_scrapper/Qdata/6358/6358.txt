You are given two spanning trees
T
1
and
T
2
on the same set of
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N). For each edge
e
1
in
T
1
, you have to calculate the number of edges
e
2
∈T
2
which satisfy the following conditions:
T
1
−e
1
+e
2
(the graph formed by removing the edge
e
1
from
T
1
and adding the edge
e
2
) is a spanning tree
T
2
−e
2
+e
1
is also a spanning tree
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the following
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting an edge in
T
1
between vertices
u and
v.
The following
N−1 lines describe the edges of
T
2
in the same format.
Output
For each test case, print
N−1 space-separated integers — the number of valid edges
e
2
for each edge
e
1
∈T
1
(in the order in which they are given on the input).
