Chef has a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Let's define a function
f(l,r) in the following way:
If
1≤l≤r≤N, then
f(l,r) is the maximum of
A
l
,A
l+1
,…,A
r
.
Otherwise,
f(l,r) is
0.
Chef wants to choose a subset
S of the set of indices
{1,2,…,N} such that
∣S∣≥K. Let's define
C=∑
i∈S
∑
j∈S
f(i,j).
Can you help Chef find the smallest value of
C he can get?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum value of
C.
Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤K≤N≤5,000
1≤A
i

for each valid
i
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10,000
