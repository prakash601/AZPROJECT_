Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median
  Example 1:
Input: N = 5
arr[] = 90 100 78 89 67
Output: 89
Explanation: After sorting the array 
middle element is the median
Example 2:
Input: N = 4
arr[] = 56 67 30 79
Output: 61
Explanation: In case of even number of 
elements, average of two middle elements 
is the median.
  Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find_median() which takes the array as input parameter and returns the floor value of the median.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <= Length of Array <= 100
1 <= Elements of Array <= 100
