You are given a positive integer
N. You have to split each digit of
N into either of two non-empty subsequences
A or
B.
For example, if
N=104, some possible values of
(A,B) can be
(10,4),(14,0) and
(1,4). Note that, after separating the digits into
A and
B, these subsequences are considered as positive integers and thus leading zeros can be omitted.
Let us define a function
F(X,Y)=(X+Y)%2. Find out whether it is possible to find two non-empty subsequences
A and
B formed out of
N such that
F(A,B)=0.
Input Format
First line will contain
, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print
YES if it is possible to find two non-empty subsequences
A and
B formed out of
N such that
F(A,B)=0. Otherwise, print
NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings
YeS,
yEs,
yes and
YES will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test Case
1: The only two possibilities are:
A=0,B=1: Here
F(A,B)=(A+B)%2=(0+1)%2=1%2=1.
A=1,B=0: Here
F(A,B)=(A+B)%2=(1+0)%2=1%2=1. Hence it's not possible to achieve
F(A,B)=0.
Test Case
2: One of the possible ways to split the digits of
N such that
F(A,B)=0 is:
A=74,B=352: Here
F(A,B)=(A+B)%2=(74+352)%2=426%2=0.
