Chef has an array
a
1
,…,a
n
of
n elements. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to
1. There are two types of operations.
1
i: Take the index
i (
1≤i≤n), and multiply it by
2 (
a
i
:=2⋅a
i
).
2
i
j: Take two indexes
i and
j (
1≤i,j≤n,i

=j), and subtract
a
j
from
a
i
, (
a
i
:=a
i
−a
j
).
All elements must be positive after each operation, and at most
10
9
.
In addition, you are given an array
b. Chef wants to make
b from
a. Help Chef to reach the array
b in no more than
43 000 operations, or determine it is impossible.
###Input:
The first line contains a single integer
n - size of the array.
The second line contains
n integers
b
1
,…b
n
- the array
b.
###Output:
If it is impossible to reach
b, print
−1.
Otherwise, output
k - the number of operations (
0≤k≤43 000). On the next
k lines, print the operations as described in the statement.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Initially, the array
a is
[1,1,1].
By the first operation,
a
3
:=2⋅a
3
, so the array becomes
[1,1,2].
By the second operation,
a
3
:=2⋅a
3
, so the array becomes
[1,1,4].
By the third operation,
a
3
:=a
3
−a
1
, so the array becomes
[1,1,3].
By the fourth operation,
a
2
:=2⋅a
2
, so the array becomes
[1,2,3]. Now the array is equal to
b, as desired.
