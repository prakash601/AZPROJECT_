A segment is a range of non-negative integers
L,L+1,L+2,…,R, denoted
[L,R] where
L≤R.
Chef has a set
S consisting of all segments
[L,R] such that either
L+R=X or
L⋅R=Y.
For example, if
X=5 and
Y=6, then Chef's set is
S={[0,5],[1,4],[1,6],[2,3]}.
Given the integers
X and
Y, can you help Chef find two non-intersecting segments from his set
S? If it is not possible to find two such non-intersecting segments, print
−1. If there are multiple possible answers, you may output any of them.
Note: Two segments are said to be non-intersecting if they have no number in common. For example,
[1,4] and
[10,42] are non-intersecting
[1,4] and
[3,10] are intersecting since they have
3 and
4 in common.
[1,4] and
[4,6] are intersecting since they have
4 in common.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers
X and
Y.
Output Format
If there are non-intersecting segments, then output two lines:
In the first line, output two space-separated integers
L
1
,R
1
denoting the first segment.
In the second line, output two space-separated integers
L
2
,R
2
denoting the second segment.
If there are no such segments, print
−1 on a single line.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
1+3=4 and
4⋅6=24, so
[1,3] and
[4,6] are both valid segments. Clearly, they also don't intersect.
Test case
2: When
X=Y=1, we have
S={[0,1],[1,1]}. The only two segments intersect with each other, so there is no answer.
