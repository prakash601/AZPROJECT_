There is an array
a
of length
n
. You may perform the following operation any number of times:
Choose two indices
l
and
r
where
1≤l<r≤n
and
al=ar
. Then, set
a[l…r]=[al+1,al+2,…,ar,al]
.
You are also given another array
b
of length
n
which is a permutation of
a
. Determine whether it is possible to transform array
a
into an array
b
using the above operation some number of times.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
)  — the length of array
a
and
b
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
)  — elements of the array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤n
)  — elements of the array
b
.
It is guaranteed that
b
is a permutation of
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to transform array
a
to
b
, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case, we can choose
l=2
and
r=5
to form
[1,3,3,2,2]
.
In the second test case, we can choose
l=2
and
r=4
to form
[1,4,2,2,1]
. Then, we can choose
l=1
and
r=5
to form
[4,2,2,1,1]
.
In the third test case, it can be proven that it is not possible to transform array
a
to
b
using the operation.
