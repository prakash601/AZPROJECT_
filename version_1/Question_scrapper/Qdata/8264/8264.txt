There are
n
houses in your city arranged on an axis at points
h1,h2,…,hn
. You want to build a new house for yourself and consider two options where to place it: points
p1
and
p2
.
As you like visiting friends, you have calculated in advance the distances from both options to all existing houses. More formally, you have calculated two arrays
d1
,
d2
:
di,j=|pi−hj|
, where
|x|
defines the absolute value of
x
.
After a long time of inactivity you have forgotten the locations of the houses
h
and the options
p1
,
p2
. But your diary still keeps two arrays —
d1
,
d2
, whose authenticity you doubt. Also, the values inside each array could be shuffled, so values at the same positions of
d1
and
d2
may correspond to different houses. Pay attention, that values from one array could not get to another, in other words, all values in the array
d1
correspond the distances from
p1
to the houses, and in the array
d2
 — from
p2
to the houses.
Also pay attention, that the locations of the houses
hi
and the considered options
pj
could match. For example, the next locations are correct:
h={1,0,3,3}
,
p={1,1}
, that could correspond to already shuffled
d1={0,2,1,2}
,
d2={2,2,1,0}
.
Check whether there are locations of houses
h
and considered points
p1
,
p2
, for which the founded arrays of distances would be correct. If it is possible, find appropriate locations of houses and considered options.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤103
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤103
) — the length of arrays
d1
,
d2
.
The next two lines contain
n
integers each: arrays
d1
and
d2
(
0≤di,j≤109
) respectively.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅103
.
Output
For each test case, output a single line "NO" if there is no answer.
Otherwise output three lines. The first line must contain "YES". In the second line, print
n
integers
h1,h2,…,hn
. In the third line print two integers
p1
,
p2
.
It must be satisfied that
0≤hi,p1,p2≤2⋅109
. We can show that if there is an answer, then there is one satisfying these constraints.
If there are several answers, output any of them.

Note
In the image below you can see the sample solutions. Planned houses are shown in bright colours: pink and purple. Existing houses are dim.
In test case
1
, the first planned house is located at point
0
, the second at point
10
. The existing house is located at point
5
and is at a distance of
5
from both planned houses.
It can be shown that there is no answer for test case
2
.
In test case
3
, the planned houses are located at points
33
and
69
.
Note that in test case
4
, both plans are located at point
1
, where one of the existing houses is located at the same time. It is a correct placement.
