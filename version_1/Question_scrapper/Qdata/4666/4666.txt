You are given a binary string
S. A binary string is a string consisting of only
0's and
1's.
A binary string is called good if it has an equal number of occurrences of
01 substrings and
10 substrings. Note that these substrings may overlap. For example, the string
1101001 is good since there are two occurrences of
01 (
11
01
001 and
11010
01
) and two occurrences of
10 (
1
10
1001 and
110
10
01).
Find the number of indices
i
(1≤i≤∣S∣) such that after flipping
S
i
, the resultant binary string is good. (If
S
i
is
0, flipping it changes it to
1, and if
S
i
is
1, flipping it changes it to
0)
Note: A string
A is a substring of a string
B if
A can be obtained from
B by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S containing
0s and
1s only.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number indices
i such that flipping
S
i
results in a good binary string.
Constraints

2≤∣S∣≤2⋅10

The sum of lengths of
S over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case 1: When
i=1, flipping
S
1
produces the string
00100, which is good since there is one occurrence of
01 (
0
01
00) and one occurrence of
10 (
00
10
0).
When
i=5, flipping
S
5
produces the string
10101, which is good since there are two occurrences of
01 (
1
01
01 and
101
01
) and are two occurrences of
10 (
10
101 and
10
10
1).
It can be shown that for
i=2,3,4 flipping
S
i
does not result in a good binary string.
Thus the number of indices resulting in a good binary string is
2.
