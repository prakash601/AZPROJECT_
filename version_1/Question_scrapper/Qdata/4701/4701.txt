Andrew likes meatballs very much as you know.
He has N plates of meatballs, here the ith plate contains exactly i meatballs. Andrew wants to take exactly K plates to his trip to Las Vegas.
On this occasion, he wants to choose the K plates by a strange way: if both ith and jth plates are chosen, then i and j must not be relative prime, for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.
Please help him to choose K plates. Output one of the possible choices.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
Output
For each test case, output K distinct integers, denoting the number of selected plates, where the plates are numbered from 1 to N. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do. If it is impossible to choose K plates, print only one integer -1.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 7
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 777

Explanation:
Example case 1: One of the possible choices is that he takes 45th plate, 63rd plate, and 35th plate. Because
GCD(45, 63) = 9,
GCD(45, 35) = 5,
GCD(63, 35) = 7.
Example case 2: He must choose all N = K plates in this case. But, for example, the pair of 3rd plate and 5th plate does not satisfy his desire. So it is impossible to choose K plates.
