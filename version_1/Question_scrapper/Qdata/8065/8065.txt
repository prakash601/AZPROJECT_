Kiyora has
𝑛
whiteboards numbered from
1
to
𝑛
. Initially, the
𝑖
-th whiteboard has the integer
𝑎
𝑖
written on it.
Koxia performs
𝑚
operations. The
𝑗
-th operation is to choose one of the whiteboards and change the integer written on it to
𝑏
𝑗
.
Find the maximum possible sum of integers written on the whiteboards after performing all
𝑚
operations.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
𝑡
(
1≤𝑡≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
𝑛
and
𝑚
(
1≤𝑛,𝑚≤100
).
The second line of each test case contains
𝑛
integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤
10
9
).
The third line of each test case contains
𝑚
integers
𝑏
1
,
𝑏
2
,…,
𝑏
𝑚
(
1≤
𝑏
𝑖
≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible sum of integers written on whiteboards after performing all
𝑚
operations.

Note
In the first test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:
Choose the
1
-st whiteboard and rewrite the integer written on it to
𝑏
1
=4
.
Choose the
2
-nd whiteboard and rewrite to
𝑏
2
=5
.
After performing all operations, the numbers on the three whiteboards are
4
,
5
and
3
respectively, and their sum is
12
. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.
In the second test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:
Choose the
2
-nd whiteboard and rewrite to
𝑏
1
=3
.
Choose the
1
-st whiteboard and rewrite to
𝑏
2
=4
.
Choose the
2
-nd whiteboard and rewrite to
𝑏
3
=5
.
The sum is
4+5=9
. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.
