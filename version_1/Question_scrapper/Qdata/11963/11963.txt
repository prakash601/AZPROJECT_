In "The Man in the High Castle" world, there are
m
different film endings.
Abendsen owns a storage and a shelf. At first, he has
n
ordered films on the shelf. In the
i
-th month he will do:
Empty the storage.
Put
ki⋅m
films into the storage,
ki
films for each ending.
He will think about a question: if he puts all the films from the shelf into the storage, then randomly picks
n
films (from all the films in the storage) and rearranges them on the shelf, what is the probability that sequence of endings in
[li,ri]
on the shelf will not be changed? Notice, he just thinks about this question, so the shelf will not actually be changed.
Answer all Abendsen's questions.
Let the probability be fraction
Pi
. Let's say that the total number of ways to take
n
films from the storage for
i
-th month is
Ai
, so
Pi⋅Ai
is always an integer. Print for each month
Pi⋅Ai(mod998244353)
.
998244353
is a prime number and it is equal to
119⋅223+1
.
It is guaranteed that there will be only no more than
100
different
k
values.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
q
(
1≤n,m,q≤105
,
n+q≤105
) — the number of films on the shelf initially, the number of endings, and the number of months.
The second line contains
n
integers
e1,e2,…,en
(
1≤ei≤m
) — the ending of the
i
-th film on the shelf.
Each of the next
q
lines contains three integers
li
,
ri
, and
ki
(
1≤li≤ri≤n,0≤ki≤105
) — the
i
-th query.
It is guaranteed that there will be only no more than
100
different
k
values.
Output
Print the answer for each question in a separate line.

Note
In the first sample in the second query, after adding
2⋅m
films into the storage, the storage will look like this:
{1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4}
.
There are
26730
total ways of choosing the films so that
el,el+1,…,er
will not be changed, for example,
[1,2,3,2,2]
and
[1,2,3,4,3]
are such ways.
There are
2162160
total ways of choosing the films, so you're asked to print
