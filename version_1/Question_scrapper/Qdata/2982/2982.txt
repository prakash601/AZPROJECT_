Given a pointer to a variable a, the task is to complete the function updateVar() which will increment the value of the variable by 10. The function does not returns anything.
Example 1:
Input:
a = 4
Output: 
14
Example 2:
Input:
a = 61
Output: 
71
Your Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function updateVar().
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= A <= 103
