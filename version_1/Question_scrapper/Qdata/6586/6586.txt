You are given a tree with
N vertices, where the
i
th
vertex has color
A
i
.
We say that an edge of this tree separates color
C if, upon deleting this edge from the tree, both obtained components contain at least one vertex having color
C.
The value of an edge is defined as the sum of all the colors it separates. For example, if an edge separates colors
{1,4,7,13}, then, its value is
1+4+7+13=25.
Find the value of every edge of the tree.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of vertices of the tree.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the colors of the vertices.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges of the tree. The
i
th
of these lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N−1 space-separated integers. The
i
th
of these integers should be the value of the
i
th
input edge.

Explanation:
Test case
1: No edge separates any color. Thus, every edge has value
0.
Test case
2: The first input edge separates color
1, while the third and fourth input edges separate color
4.
Test case
3: The colors separated by each input edge are as follows:
