Sarthak has a set
S of
N distinct prime numbers. He grew very fond of that set, and now he only likes a positive integer

M, can you find out how many integers he likes which are not more than
M?
Note: Sarthak always like the number
1.
Input Format
The first line of each input contains
T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M - the size of
S and the limit defined in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
S

N
- the elements of
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of positive integers Sarthak likes that is not more than
M.
