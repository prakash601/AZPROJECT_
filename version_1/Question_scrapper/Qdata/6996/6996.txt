A group of
N people (numbered
1 through
N) claimed that Chef is only good at cooking, but nothing else. Chef wanted to prove them wrong, so he accepted a challenge from them to guess their ages.
The
N people gave Chef
M pieces of information to help him. Each piece of information is described by four integers
t,
u,
v and
c with the following meaning:
If
t=1, the
u-th person is older than the
v-th person by at least
c years.
If
t=2, the
u-th person is not older than the
v-th person by at least
c years.
Chef also knows that all the ages are integers (strangely, not necessarily positive integers) and that the age of person
1 is zero.
Before Chef started thinking about the ages, he asked you to tell him whether it is even possible to determine the ages of all
N people uniquely using the information he has. Find out if it is possible and what the ages of these
N people are in that case.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
Each of the following
M lines contains four space-separated integers
t,
u,
v and
c describing one piece of information.
Output
For each test case:
If it is impossible to uniquely determine the ages of all the people, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain a single string "YES" (without quotes).
The second line should contain
N space-separated integers denoting the ages of people
1,2,…,N respectively.
