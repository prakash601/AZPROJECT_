Chef has
A units of solid and
B units of liquid. He combines them to create a mixture. What kind of mixture does Chef produce: a solution, a solid, or a liquid?
A mixture is called :
A solution if
A>0 and
B>0,
A solid if
B=0, or
A liquid if
A=0.
Input Format
The first line contains
T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers
A and
B on a single line.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the type of mixture Chef produces, whether it is a Solution, Solid, or Liquid. The output is case sensitive.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef adds both solid and liquid to the mixture, hence the mixture is a solution.
Test case
2: Chef does not add solid to the mixture, hence the mixture is liquid.
Test case
3: Chef does not add liquid to the mixture, hence the mixture is solid.
