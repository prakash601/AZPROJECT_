You are given a positive integer
N.
Construct an array
A of length
N such that:
−300≤A
i
≤300
∣A
i
+A
i+1
+A
i+2
+…+A
j
∣ is not divisible by
(j−i+1) for all pairs
(i,j)
(1≤i<j≤N).
Note that
∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of
X. For example
∣−2∣=2 and
∣5∣=5.
If multiple such arrays exist, print any.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid array satisfying the given constraints.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single line of input.
The only line of each test case contains a positive integer
N — the length of array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line,
N space-separated integers, denoting array
A.
If multiple such arrays exist, print any.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
2≤N≤500

Explanation:
Test case
1:
∣10+3∣=13 which is not divisible by
2−1+1=2. Thus, the array satisfies the conditions.
Test case
2: The subarrays are:
i=1,j=2:
∣20+31∣=51 which is not divisible by
2.
i=2,j=3:
∣31+14∣=45 which is not divisible by
2.
i=1,j=3:
∣20+31+14∣=65 which is not divisible by
3.
Thus, the array satisfies the conditions.
