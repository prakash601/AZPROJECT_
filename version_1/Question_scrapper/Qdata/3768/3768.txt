There are
3 problems in a contest namely
A,B,C respectively. Alice bets Bob that problem
C is the hardest while Bob says that problem
B will be the hardest.
You are given three integers
S
A
,S
B
,S
C
which denotes the number of successful submissions of the problems
A,B,C respectively. It is guaranteed that each problem has a different number of submissions. Determine who wins the bet.
If Alice wins the bet (i.e. problem
C is the hardest), then output
Alice.
If Bob wins the bet (i.e. problem
B is the hardest), then output
Bob.
If no one wins the bet (i.e. problem
A is the hardest), then output
Draw.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
S
A
,S
B
,S
C
, denoting the number of successful submissions of problems
A,B,C respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output the winner of the bet or print Draw in case no one wins the bet.
