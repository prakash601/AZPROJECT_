Nathan is preparing for the Dash marathon. He has
N training plans. The
i-th plan has an effectiveness of
A
i
, but requires that at least
B
i
other training plans must be performed before it. A training plan cannot be repeated.
If he performs some
K>0 distinct trainings -
P

,P

(1≤P

) then his training score is
K
∑
j=1
K

. If Nathan does not perform any training plan
(K=0), then his score is
0.
What is the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans, if he can perform them in any order?
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. The description of
test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the number of training plans.
The second line contains
N integers
A

where
A

is the effectiveness of the
i-th training plan.
The third line contains
N integers

where
B

is the number of pre-requisite training plans for the
i-th training plan.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single real number - the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed

X, and the jury's answer be
Y. Your answer is accepted if and only if

Explanation:
Test case 1: It is optimal for Nathan to not perform any training plans as all the plans have negative
A
i
value.
Test case 2: It is optimal for Nathan to:
First, perform the
4-th training plan (for which
B
i
=0).
Then perform the
2-nd training plan (for which
B
i
=1 which is satisfied as he has already performed
1 training plan)
Test case 3: It is optimal for Nathan to:
First, perform the
1-st training plan (for which
B
i
=0).
Then perform the
2-nd training plan (for which
B
i
=1 which is satisfied as he has already performed
1 training plan)
Then perform the
4-th training plan (for which
B
i
=2 which is satisfied as he has already performed
2 training plans)
