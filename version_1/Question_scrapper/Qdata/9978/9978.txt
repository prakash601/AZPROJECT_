— Hey folks, how do you like this problem?
— That'll do it.
BThero is a powerful magician. He has got
n
piles of candies, the
i
-th pile initially contains
ai
candies. BThero can cast a copy-paste spell as follows:
He chooses two piles
(i,j)
such that
1≤i,j≤n
and
i≠j
.
All candies from pile
i
are copied into pile
j
. Formally, the operation
aj:=aj+ai
is performed.
BThero can cast this spell any number of times he wants to — but unfortunately, if some pile contains strictly more than
k
candies, he loses his magic power. What is the maximum number of times BThero can cast the spell without losing his power?
Input
The first line contains one integer
T
(
1≤T≤500
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
the first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤1000
,
2≤k≤104
);
the second line contains
n
integers
a1
,
a2
, ...,
an
(
1≤ai≤k
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
1000
, and the sum of
k
over all test cases does not exceed
104
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of times BThero can cast the spell without losing his magic power.

Note
In the first test case we get either
a=[1,2]
or
a=[2,1]
after casting the spell for the first time, and it is impossible to cast it again.
