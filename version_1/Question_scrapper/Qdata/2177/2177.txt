Given a string consisting of spaces,\t,\n and lower case  alphabets.Your task is to count the number of words where spaces,\t and \n work as separators.
  Example 1:
Input: S = "abc def"
Output: 2
Explanation: There is a space at 4th
position which works as a seperator
between "abc" and "def"

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
where N is length of given String.
