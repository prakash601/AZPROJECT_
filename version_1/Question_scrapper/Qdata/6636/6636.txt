Originally, everyone could happily get their own takeout, but a demon appeared. The demon can steal exactly
1 takeout.
The demon knows the regular pattern of human action. When a person arrives for the takeout:
If his takeout exists, he will happily take his takeout;
If his takeout does not exist, and there are other takeouts, (because he is dazed by anger) he will take the takeout with the lowest number;
If there is no takeout, he can only leave in frustration.
Define evil person as the person who takes the takeout that does not belong to him. The demon wants to maximize the number of evil people. Can you help him?

Explanation:
Test case
1:the best strategy is to steal takeout
1.
Moment
2: takeout
2 arrives;
Moment
3: person
1 arrives and takes takeout
2;
Moment
4: takeout
3 arrives;
Moment
5: person
2 arrives and takes takeout
3;
Moment
6: person
3 arrives and leaves in frustration.
In this case, evil people are persons
1 and
2. It can be proved that
2 is the maximum answer.
