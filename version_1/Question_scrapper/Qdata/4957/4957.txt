You are given a binary string
S of length
N and an integer
K. You can perform the following operation on the string:
Select a prefix of the string
S and flip all the characters of the prefix. A flip corresponds to changing
0 to
1 and vice-versa.
Find the minimum number of operations required to obtain a substring of length
K such that all characters of the substring are
1.
Note:
A prefix is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from the end of the string.
A substring is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of the string and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of the string.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the length of the string and the length length of substring containing all
1s we want to achieve.
The next line contains the binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to obtain a substring of length
K such that all characters of the substring are
1.
Constraints
1≤T≤2000
1≤K≤N≤3⋅10

S consists of
0 and
1 only.
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
3⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: We need to obtain a substring containing three
1s. Using one operation, we can select the prefix
S[1,3] and flip all the characters in the prefix. Thus, the string becomes
111.
Test case
2: The string already contains a substring having two
1s. Thus, we do not need any operation.
Test case
3: We need to obtain a substring containing three
1s. We can do so using
2 operations:
Operation
1: Select the prefix
S[1,4] and flip all characters in the prefix. Thus, the string becomes
01011.
Operation
2: Select the prefix
S[1,3] and flip all characters in the prefix. Thus, the string becomes
10111.
Thus, we have a substring
S[3,5] of length
3 where all characters of the substring are
1. It can be shown that we cannot obtain such substring using less than
2 operations.
