You are given a positive integer
N. You have to print exactly
N+1 positive integers satisfying the following conditions:
Exactly one value should appear twice, all the remaining values should appear only once.
Sum of all these values should be equal to
2
N
.
You have to print the values in non-decreasing order. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N+1 positive integers in non-decreasing order that satisfy the given conditions. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.
