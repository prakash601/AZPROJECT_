You are given an array
A consisting of
N positive integers.
Suppose
F(B,X) gives the minimum positive integer
Y such that:
X divides
Y⋅B
i
for all
(1≤i≤∣B∣).
Find the value of
F(A,A
i
) for all
(1≤i≤N).
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, print
N space-separated integers where the
i
th
integer denotes the value
F(A,A
i
).

Explanation:
Test case
1: Given
A=[1,2]
F(A,A
1
)=F(A,1)=1: Here
X=1 and
Y=1 as
X=1 divides both
Y⋅A
1
=1 and
Y⋅A
2
=2.
F(A,A
2
)=F(A,2)=2: Here
X=2 and
Y=2 as
X=2 divides both
Y⋅A
1
=2 and
Y⋅A
2
=4.
Note that the values of
Y are minimum possible for both
F(A,A
1
) and
F(A,A
2
).
Test case
2: Given
A=[2,2,2]
F(A,A
1
)=F(A,2)=1: Here
X=2 and
Y=1 as
X=1 divides
Y⋅A
1
=2,Y⋅A
2
=2, and
Y⋅A
3
=2.
F(A,A
2
)=F(A,2)=1: Here
X=2 and
Y=1 as
X=1 divides
Y⋅A
1
=2,Y⋅A
2
=2, and
Y⋅A
3
=2.
F(A,A
3
)=F(A,2)=1: Here
X=2 and
Y=1 as
X=1 divides
Y⋅A
1
=2,Y⋅A
2
=2, and
Y⋅A
3
=2.
Note that the values of
Y are minimum possible for
F(A,A
1
),F(A,A
2
), and
F(A,A
3
).
