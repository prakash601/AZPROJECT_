Chef got another sequence as a birthday present. He does not like this sequence very much because it is not sorted. Since you are a good programmer, Chef is asking for your help.
You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and an integer
K. You may perform any number of operations of the following type (in any order): choose a valid integer
i and swap
A
i
with
A
i+K
. Can you sort the sequence this way?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if the sequence can be sorted or "no" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤K≤N≤10
5
1≤A
i
≤10
9
for each valid
i
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): the sequence
A is a permutation of the integers
1 through
N
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
Sample 1:
Input
Output
2
4 1
1 4 2 3
4 2
1 4 2 3
yes
no
Explanation:
Example case 1: We may freely swap adjacent elements, so the sequence can be sorted e.g. in the following way:
(1,4,2,3)→(1,2,4,3)→(1,2,3,4).
