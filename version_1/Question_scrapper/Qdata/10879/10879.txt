The string
t1t2…tk
is good if each letter of this string belongs to at least one palindrome of length greater than 1.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings A, BAB, ABBA, BAABBBAAB are palindromes, but the strings AB, ABBBAA, BBBA are not.
Here are some examples of good strings:
t
= AABBB (letters
t1
,
t2
belong to palindrome
t1…t2
and letters
t3
,
t4
,
t5
belong to palindrome
t3…t5
);
t
= ABAA (letters
t1
,
t2
,
t3
belong to palindrome
t1…t3
and letter
t4
belongs to palindrome
t3…t4
);
t
= AAAAA (all letters belong to palindrome
t1…t5
);
You are given a string
s
of length
n
, consisting of only letters A and B.
You have to calculate the number of good substrings of string
s
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅105
) — the length of the string
s
.
The second line contains the string
s
, consisting of letters A and B.
Output
Print one integer — the number of good substrings of string
s
.

Note
In the first test case there are six good substrings:
s1…s2
,
s1…s4
,
s1…s5
,
s3…s4
,
s3…s5
and
s4…s5
.
In the second test case there are three good substrings:
s1…s2
,
s1…s3
and
s2…s3
.
