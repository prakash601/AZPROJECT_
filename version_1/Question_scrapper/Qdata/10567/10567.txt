This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543
Find the distance between vertices
1
and
n
in an undirected weighted graph.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n,m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅105
) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.
Each of the next
m
lines contain description of an edge
ai bi costi
(
1≤ai,bi≤n
,
1≤costi≤109
).
Loops and multiple edges? Hmm, why not?
Output
Print one integer — the answer to the problem. If there is no path, print
−1
instead.
