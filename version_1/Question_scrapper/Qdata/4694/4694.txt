"What do you know about happiness?" — Yoda
Chef is happy only if three conditions hold:
Chef finished cooking a delicious meal
Chef got AC for a programming problem with an almost correct code
Chef got a new problem with a sequence of integers
Today, all three conditions are satisfied. Chef would like you to feel his happiness and provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.
You are given a sequence
A
1
A
2
A
N
. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices
i and
j such that
A
i

=A
j
, but
A
A
i
=
A
A
j
. (If it was possible, Chef would be truly happy.)
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Truly Happy" if it is possible to choose required indices or "Poor Chef" otherwise.
Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤10
5
1≤A
i
≤N for each valid
i
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed

Explanation:
Example case 1: Chef is truly happy because
A
A
3
=A
A

and
A


=A

.
Example case 2: There is no pair of indices which would make Chef truly happy. For instance,
A
A
3
=A
A
4
, but
A
