LuoTianyi gives you an array
a
of
n
integers and the index begins from
1
.
Define
g(i,j)
as follows:
g(i,j)
is the largest integer
x
that satisfies
{ap:i≤p≤j}⊆{aq:x≤q≤j}
while
i≤j
;
and
g(i,j)=0
while
i>j
.
There are
q
queries. For each query you are given four integers
l,r,x,y
, you need to calculate
r
∑
i=l
y
∑
j=x
g(i,j)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤106
) — the length of the array
a
and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — the elements of the array
a
.
Next
q
lines describe a query. The
i
-th line contains four integers
l,r,x,y
(
1≤l≤r≤n,1≤x≤y≤n
) — the integers in the
i
-th query.
Output
Print
q
lines where
i
-th line contains one integer — the answer for the
i
-th query.

Note
In the first example:
In the first query, the answer is
g(1,4)+g(1,5)=3+3=6
.
x=1,2,3
can satisfies
{ap:1≤p≤4}⊆{aq:x≤q≤4}
,
3
is the largest integer so
g(1,4)=3
.
In the second query, the answer is
g(2,3)+g(3,3)=3+3=6
.
In the third query, the answer is
0
, because all
i>j
and
g(i,j)=0
.
In the fourth query, the answer is
g(6,6)=6
.
In the second example:
In the second query, the answer is
g(2,3)=2
.
In the fourth query, the answer is
g(1,4)+g(1,5)=2+2=4
.
