In Chefland, there are
M types of cookies, numbered
1 through
M. There is an infinite supply of cookies of each type.
Each morning, the Master Chef of Chefland prepares a menu — a sequence of cookies. There may be multiple cookies with identical types in a menu. Two menus are considered different if the total number of cookies in one menu is different from their total number in the other menu or there is a valid index
x such that the type of the
x-th cookie in one menu is different from the type of the
x-th cookie in the other menu. For example, menus
(1,2,1),
(1,2,1,2) are different, and
(1,1,2,3),
(1,2,1,3) are also different.
To make things interesting, each morning, Master Chef receives three integers
L,
R and
K. To prepare a menu on that morning, he may use a cookie of type
x only if
L≤x≤R and he may not use more than
K cookies in total in this menu. For example, when
L=3,
R=5 and
K=4, then
(5,4,3,5) and
(3,5,5) are possible menus, while
(5,4,3,5,4) and
(3,5,6) are not.
Moreover, a menu becomes special only if there is no integer
x>1 that divides the type of each cookie in the menu, i.e. a menu
S=(s

,s

,…,s
n
) is special if
gcd(s

,s

,…,s
n
)=1.
You should process
Q queries. In each query, you are given the parameters
L,
R and
K for one morning. Master Chef wonders how many different special menus are possible. Can you help him calculate the number of possible special menus on each morning modulo
2
30
?
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
M and
Q.
Each of the next
Q lines contains three space-separated integers
L,
R and
K describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible special menus modulo
2
30
.
