Given two strings A and B. Find the characters that are not common in the two strings. 
Note :- Return the string in sorted order.
Example 1:
Input:
A = geeksforgeeks
B = geeksquiz
Output: fioqruz
Explanation: 
The characters 'f', 'i', 'o', 'q', 'r', 'u','z' 
are either present in A or B, but not in both.
Example 2:
Input:
A = characters
B = alphabets
 bclpr
Explanation: The characters 'b','c','l','p','r' 
are either present in A or B, but not in both.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function UncommonChars() which takes strings A and B as input parameters and returns a string that contains all the uncommon characters in sorted order. If no such character exists return "-1".

Expected Time Complexity: O(M+N) where M and N are the sizes of A and B respectively.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(M+N)  

Constraints:
1<= M,N <= 104
String may contain duplicate characters.
