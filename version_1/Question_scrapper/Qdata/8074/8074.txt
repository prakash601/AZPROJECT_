You are given an array of positive integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…,
𝑎
𝑛
of length
𝑛
.
In one operation you can jump from index
𝑖
to index
𝑗
(
1≤𝑖≤𝑗≤𝑛
) by paying
min(
𝑎
𝑖
,
𝑎
𝑖+1
,…,
𝑎
𝑗
)⋅(𝑗−𝑖
)
2
eris.
For all
𝑘
from
1
to
𝑛
, find the minimum number of eris needed to get from index
1
to index
𝑘
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
𝑛
(
2≤𝑛≤4⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
𝑛
integers
𝑎
1
,
𝑎
2
,…
𝑎
𝑛
(
1≤
𝑎
𝑖
≤𝑛
).
Output
Output
𝑛
integers — the
𝑘
-th integer is the minimum number of eris needed to reach index
𝑘
if you start from index
1
.

Note
In the first example:
From
1
to
1
: the cost is
0
,
From
1
to
2
:
1→2
— the cost is
min(2,1)⋅(2−1
)
2
=1
,
From
1
to
3
:
1→2→3
— the cost is
min(2,1)⋅(2−1
)
2
+min(1,3)⋅(3−2
)
2
=1+1=2
.
In the fourth example from
1
to
4
:
1→3→4
— the cost is
min(1,4,4)⋅(3−1
)
2
+min(4,4)⋅(4−3
)
2
=4+4=8
.
