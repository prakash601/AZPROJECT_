Chef has two integers
X and
S. He is interested in sequences of non-negative integers such that the sum of their elements is
S and the bitwise OR of their elements is
X. Chef would like to know the shortest possible length such a sequence can have.
Formally, find the smallest positive integer
N such that there exists a sequence
A=[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
] satisfying the following conditions:
Each
A
i
is a non-negative integer
A
1
+A
2
+…+A
N
=S
A
1
∨A
2
∨…∨A
N
=X
where
∨ denotes the bitwise OR operation.
If there does not exist any sequence which satisfies the above conditions, output
−1. Otherwise, output the minimum possible length of such a sequence.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers
X and
S — the required bitwise OR and sum, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the shortest possible length of such a sequence, or
−1 if no such sequence exists.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: One of the valid arrays of length
3 is
[9,9,5]. It can be shown that there is no valid array with length
<3.
Test Case
2: There does not exist any sequence whose sum is
13 and bitwise OR is
6.
Test Case
3: The valid array of minimum length contains
25 ones.
