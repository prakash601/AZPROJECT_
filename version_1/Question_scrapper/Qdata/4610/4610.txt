Given a positive integer
n and an integer
k such that
0≤k≤n, find any permutation
A of
1,2…n such that the number of indices for which
A
i
=i is exactly
k. If there exists no such permutation, print
−1. If there exist multiple such permutations, print any one of them.
Input Format
First line of the input contains
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers
n,k.
Output Format
For each test case, print a permutation in a single line, if a permutation with the given constraints exists. Print
otherwise.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are total
2 permutations of
[1,2] which are
[1,2] and
[2,1]. There are
2 indices in
[1,2] and
0 indices in
[2,1] for which
A
i
=i holds true. Thus, there doesn't exist any permutation of
[1,2] with exactly
1 index
i for which
A
i
=i holds true.
Test case
2: Consider the permutation
A=[1,3,2]. We have
A
1
=1,
A
2
=3 and
A
3
=2. So, this permutation has exactly
1 index such that
A
i
=i.
