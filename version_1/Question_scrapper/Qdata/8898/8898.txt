Consider an array of integers
C=[c1,c2,…,cn]
of length
n
. Let's build the sequence of arrays
D0,D1,D2,…,Dn
of length
n+1
in the following way:
The first element of this sequence will be equals
C
:
D0=C
.
For each
1≤i≤n
array
Di
will be constructed from
Di−1
in the following way:
Let's find the lexicographically smallest subarray of
Di−1
of length
i
. Then, the first
n−i
elements of
Di
will be equals to the corresponding
n−i
elements of array
Di−1
and the last
i
elements of
Di
will be equals to the corresponding elements of the found subarray of length
i
.
Array
x
is subarray of array
y
, if
x
can be obtained by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning of
y
and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end of
y
.
For array
C
let's denote array
Dn
as
op(C)
.
Alice has an array of integers
A=[a1,a2,…,an]
of length
n
. She will build the sequence of arrays
B0,B1,…,Bn
of length
n+1
in the following way:
The first element of this sequence will be equals
A
:
B0=A
.
For each
1≤i≤n
array
Bi
will be equals
op(Bi−1)
, where
op
is the transformation described above.
She will ask you
q
queries about elements of sequence of arrays
B0,B1,…,Bn
. Each query consists of two integers
i
and
j
, and the answer to this query is the value of the
j
-th element of array
Bi
.
Input
The first line contains the single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of array
A
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — the array
A
.
The third line contains the single integer
q
(
1≤q≤106
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
i
,
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
) — parameters of queries.
Output
Output
q
integers: values of
Bi,j
for required
i
,
j
.

Note
In the first test case
B0=A=[2,1,3,1]
.
B1
is constructed in the following way:
Initially,
D0=[2,1,3,1]
.
For
i=1
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D0
of length
1
is
[1]
, so
D1
will be
[2,1,3,1]
.
For
i=2
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D1
of length
2
is
[1,3]
, so
D2
will be
[2,1,1,3]
.
For
i=3
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D2
of length
3
is
[1,1,3]
, so
D3
will be
[2,1,1,3]
.
For
i=4
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D3
of length
4
is
[2,1,1,3]
, so
D4
will be
[2,1,1,3]
.
So,
B1=op(B0)=op([2,1,3,1])=[2,1,1,3]
.
