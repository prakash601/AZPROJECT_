You are given an integer array
a1,a2,…,an
.
The array
b
is called to be a subsequence of
a
if it is possible to remove some elements from
a
to get
b
.
Array
b1,b2,…,bk
is called to be good if it is not empty and for every
i
(
1≤i≤k
)
bi
is divisible by
i
.
Find the number of good subsequences in
a
modulo
109+7
.
Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values of the elements do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array
a
has exactly
2n−1
different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤100000
) — the length of the array
a
.
The next line contains integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤106
).
Output
Print exactly one integer — the number of good subsequences taken modulo
109+7
.

Note
In the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good:
{1}
,
{1,2}
,
{2}
In the second example, the possible good subsequences are:
{2}
,
{2,2}
,
{2,22}
,
{2,14}
,
{2}
,
{2,22}
,
{2,14}
,
{1}
,
{1,22}
,
{1,14}
,
{22}
,
{22,14}
,
{14}
.
Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.
