Given an array
A having
N elements, Chef wonders how many pairs
(i,j) exists such that
1≤i<j≤N, and
A
i
⋅A
j
is divisible by
i⋅j.
Can you help Chef in finding the number of such pairs?
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the
T testcases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N denoting the number of elements in
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
.
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of pairs that satisfies the above condition.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: For all possible pairs of
{i,j},
A
i
⋅A
j
is divisible by
i⋅j.
Test Case
2: The condition holds for the following two pairs of
{i,j}:
{1,2},
{1,4}.
