You are given a matrix
A of non-negative integers with
N rows (numbered
1 through
N) and
N columns (numbered
1 through
N). For each valid
i and
j, let's denote the element in the
i-th row and
j-th column by
A
i,j
.
You need to find a matrix
B with
N+1 rows and
N+1 columns (numbered similarly) such that:
each element of this matrix is a digit between
0 and
9 (inclusive)
A
i,j
=B
i,j
+B
i+1,j
+B
i,j+1
+B
i+1,j+1
for each valid
i,j
The matrix
A is chosen in such a way that at least one solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains
N space-separated integers
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,…,A
i,N
.
Output
Print
N+1 lines. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines should contain
N+1 characters
B
i,1
,B
i,2
,…,B
i,N+1
.
Constraints
1≤N≤100
for the matrix
A, at least one valid matrix
B exists
