There are
n
Christmas trees on an infinite number line. The
i
-th tree grows at the position
xi
. All
xi
are guaranteed to be distinct.
Each integer point can be either occupied by the Christmas tree, by the human or not occupied at all. Non-integer points cannot be occupied by anything.
There are
m
people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let
y1,y2,…,ym
be the positions of people (note that all values
x1,x2,…,xn,y1,y2,…,ym
should be distinct and all
yj
should be integer). You want to find such an arrangement of people that the value
m
∑
j=1
n
min
i=1
|xi−yj|
is the minimum possible (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people should be minimized).
In other words, let
dj
be the distance from the
j
-th human to the nearest Christmas tree (
dj=
n
min
i=1
|yj−xi|
). Then you need to choose such positions
y1,y2,…,ym
that
m
∑
j=1
dj
is the minimum possible.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅105
) — the number of Christmas trees and the number of people.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
x1,x2,…,xn
(
−109≤xi≤109
), where
xi
is the position of the
i
-th Christmas tree. It is guaranteed that all
xi
are distinct.
Output
In the first line print one integer
res
— the minimum possible value of
m
∑
j=1
n
min
i=1
|xi−yj|
(in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people).
In the second line print
m
integers
y1,y2,…,ym
(
−2⋅109≤yj≤2⋅109
), where
yj
is the position of the
j
-th human. All
yj
should be distinct and all values
x1,x2,…,xn,y1,y2,…,ym
should be distinct.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
