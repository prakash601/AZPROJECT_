You are given a bipartite graph
G=(U,V,E), and an integer
K.
U and
V are the two bipartitions of the graph such that |
U| = |
V| =
N , and
E is the edge set. The vertices of
U are {
1,2,...,N } and that of
V are {
N+1,N+2,...,2N }. You need to find out whether the total number of different perfect matchings in
G is strictly greater than
K or not.
Recall that a perfect matching is a subset of
E such that every vertex of the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the subset. Two perfect matchings are considered to be different even if one edge is different.
###Input
First line of the input contains three integers:
N,
M and
K, which represent |
U| (which is also equal to |
V|), |
E| and the queried threshold respectively. The i-th of the next
lines contains two numbers
i
and
i
which denote the i-th edge is between the vertices
L
i
and
R
i
.
###Output
A single line containing “Yes” if the number of perfect matchings is greater than
K, and “No” othewise.

###Explanation: Explanation 1: The graph is as follows:
There are exactly two perfect matchings in this graph: {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)} and {(1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5)}. The number of perfect matchings is not
>K, and hence the output is “No”.
Explanation 2: The graph is the same as previous one, and the same 2 perfect matchings are present. But now,
K is 1. Therefore, the number of perfect matchings is >
K, and hence the output is “Yes”.
