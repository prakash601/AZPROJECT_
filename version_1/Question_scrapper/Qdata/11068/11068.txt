You are given two binary strings
x
and
y
, which are binary representations of some two integers (let's denote these integers as
f(x)
and
f(y)
). You can choose any integer
k≥0
, calculate the expression
sk=f(x)+f(y)⋅2k
and write the binary representation of
sk
in reverse order (let's denote it as
revk
). For example, let
x=1010
and
y=11
; you've chosen
k=1
and, since
21=102
, so
sk=10102+112⋅102=100002
and
revk=00001
.
For given
x
and
y
, you need to choose such
k
that
revk
is lexicographically minimal (read notes if you don't know what does "lexicographically" means).
It's guaranteed that, with given constraints,
k
exists and is finite.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of queries.
Next
2T
lines contain a description of queries: two lines per query. The first line contains one binary string
x
, consisting of no more than
105
characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.
The second line contains one binary string
y
, consisting of no more than
105
characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.
It's guaranteed, that
1≤f(y)≤f(x)
(where
f(x)
is the integer represented by
x
, and
f(y)
is the integer represented by
y
), both representations don't have any leading zeroes, the total length of
x
over all queries doesn't exceed
105
, and the total length of
y
over all queries doesn't exceed
105
.
Output
Print
T
integers (one per query). For each query print such
k
that
revk
is lexicographically minimal.

Note
The first query was described in the legend.
In the second query, it's optimal to choose
k=3
. The
23=10002
so
s3=100012+1102⋅10002=10001+110000=1000001
and
rev3=1000001
. For example, if
k=0
, then
s0=10111
and
rev0=11101
, but
rev3=1000001
is lexicographically smaller than
rev0=11101
.
In the third query
s0=10
and
rev0=01
. For example,
s2=101
and
rev2=101
. And
01
is lexicographically smaller than
101
.
The quote from Wikipedia: "To determine which of two strings of characters comes when arranging in lexicographical order, their first letters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order."
