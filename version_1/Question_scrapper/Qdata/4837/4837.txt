You are given an unsorted permutation
P of size
N. An operation is defined as:
Swap
P
i
and
P
i+K
for any
i in the range
[1,N−K].
Find the maximum value of
K, such that, the permutation
P can be sorted by applying any finite number of operations.
Note that, a permutation of size
N contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N, the size of permutation.
The next line contains
N integers describing the permutation
P.
It is guaranteed that the given permutation is not sorted.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible value of
K.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: Permutation can be sorted by swapping
P
1
and
P
4
. So, the maximum possible value of
K is
3. It can be shown that we cannot sort the permutation for any
K>3.
Test Case
2: Swapping
P
2
and
P
4
will sort the permutation. So, the maximum possible value of
K is
2. It can be shown that we cannot sort the permutation for any
K>2.
Test Case
3: Swapping
P
1
and
P
2
will sort the permutation. So, the maximum possible value of
K is
1. It can be shown that we cannot sort the permutation for any
K>1.
