Given an array containing 0s and 1s. Find the number of subarrays having equal number of 0s and 1s.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 7
A[] = {1,0,0,1,0,1,1}
Output: 8
Explanation: The index range for the 8 
sub-arrays are: (0, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3), (3, 4), 
(4, 5) ,(2, 5), (0, 5), (1, 6)
Example 2:
Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1,1,1,1,0}
Output: 1
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countSubarrWithEqualZeroAndOne() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array as inputs and returns the number of subarrays with equal number of 0s and 1s.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
0 <= A[i] <= 1
