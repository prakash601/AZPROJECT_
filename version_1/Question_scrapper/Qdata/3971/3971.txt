For a positive integer
M, MoEngage defines
digitSum(M) as the sum of digits of the number
M (when written in decimal).
For example,
digitSum(1023)=1+0+2+3=6.
Given a positive integer
N, find the smallest integer
X strictly greater than
N such that:
digitSum(N) and
digitSum(X) have different parity, i.e. one of them is odd and the other is even.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T, the number of test cases. The description of the
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input with a single integer, the number
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print in a single line, an integer, the answer to the problem.

Explanation:
Test Case
1:
digitSum(123)=1+2+3=6 is even and
digitSum(124)=1+2+4=7 is odd, so the answer is
124.
Test Case
2:
digitSum(19)=1+9=10 is even,
digitSum(20)=2+0=2 is also even, whereas
digitSum(21)=2+1=3 is odd. Hence, the answer is
21.
Test Case
3:
digitSum(509)=5+0+9=14 is even,
digitSum(510)=5+1+0=6 is also even, whereas
digitSum(511)=5+1+1=7 is odd. Hence, the answer is
511.
