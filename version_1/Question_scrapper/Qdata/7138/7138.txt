This is an interactive problem.
There’s a hidden array
A of size
N. Each element of the array is either
1 or
2.
Your task is to find any subarray with sum
K.
To do that, you can ask certain queries. In each query, you choose two positive integers
L and
R
(1≤L≤R≤N).
The judge will reply with
Σ
i=L
R
A
i
, that is, the sum of the subarray
A[L,R].
Use at most
40 queries to find a subarray with sum
K.
Note that a subarray is formed by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.
Interaction
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
You should start by reading a line containing two space-separated integers
N and
K, the size of the array and the required sum.
To ask a query, you should print a line containing three space-separated integers
1,L, and
R
(1≤L≤R≤N). Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: the answer to your query or
−1 if the query is invalid or you asked more than
40 queries.
To finish solving a test case, you should print a single line containing three space-separated integers
2,L, and
R, where
L and
R denote the subarray with sum
K. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer:
1 if your output is correct or
−1 if it is incorrect. You can print any subarray having sum
K.
Note
After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python.
After an anwser, do not forget to read a line containing a single integer:
1 if your output is correct or
−1 if it is incorrect.
If the test status is "Wrong Answer", it means: your answer is incorrect, or you asked more than
40 queries.
If the test status is "Judge Error", it means: you have't flushed the output, or your IO are invalid.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤10
5
The test data guarantees that such a subarray exists.
Example
You                 Grader
                    1
                    4 5
1 1 1
                    1
1 2 2
                    1
1 3 3
                    2
1 4 4
                    2
2 2 4
                    1
Explanation
Here,
A=[1,1,2,2] and
K=5. You can use
4 queries to get
A
1
=1,A
2
=1,A
3
=2, and
A
4
=2. For the subarray
A[2,4], the sum is
K, that is,
A
2
+A
3
+A
4
=1+2+2=5.
