There are
N types of medicines and
M types of diseases where medicine types are numbered from
1 to
N and disease types are numbered from
1 to
M. You have infinite medicines of each type.
For every disease
d, you have a strength
f(d). Initially,
f(d)=0 for all
1≤d≤M.
The
i
th
medicine increments your strength for a particular disease (say
x
i
) and decrements your strength for another disease (say
y
i
). In particular, if you take the medicine of
i
th
type, then:
f(x
i
)→f(x
i
)+1
f(y
i
)→f(y
i
)−1
Let
S be a subset of the
M diseases. You are considered immune to
S if and only if, there exists a finite number of medicines you can take such that after you take all those medicines, you have
f(d)>0 for all
d∈S.
Remember that you have infinite medicines of each type. So you could take
10 medicines of type
1, and
3 medicines of type
2, etc.
Count the number of subsets of diseases you are immune to. Print the number modulo
10

+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of types of medicines and the number of types of diseases, respectively.
The next
N lines describe the medicines. The
i
th
of these
N lines contain two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
, denoting the disease on which the strength increases and decreases respectively after taking the
i
th
medicine.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of subsets of diseases you are immune to, modulo
10

+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
4 subsets of diseases that you are immune to.
The
{} set: there are no diseases so you are automatically immune to the empty set.
{2}: If you take the first tablet, you become immune.
{3}: If you take the second tablet, you become immune.
{2,3}: If you take the first and second tablet then your,
f(1) becomes
−2,
f(2) becomes
1 and
f(3) becomes
1. Which makes you immune to this subset.
It can be proven that you are not immune to any other subset.
