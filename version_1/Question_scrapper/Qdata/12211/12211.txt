You are given a string
s
. You should answer
n
queries. The
i
-th query consists of integer
ki
and string
mi
. The answer for this query is the minimum length of such a string
t
that
t
is a substring of
s
and
mi
has at least
ki
occurrences as a substring in
t
.
A substring of a string is a continuous segment of characters of the string.
It is guaranteed that for any two queries the strings
mi
from these queries are different.
Input
The first line contains string
s
(1≤|s|≤105)
.
The second line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
Each of next
n
lines contains an integer
ki
(1≤ki≤|s|)
and a non-empty string
mi
 — parameters of the query with number
i
, in this order.
All strings in input consists of lowercase English letters. Sum of length of all strings in input doesn't exceed
105
. All
mi
are distinct.
Output
For each query output the answer for it in a separate line.
If a string
mi
occurs in
s
less that
ki
times, output -1.
