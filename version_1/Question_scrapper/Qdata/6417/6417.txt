A famous student of AESC MSU, as you know, comes from Kostomuksha. Kostomuksha has a popular game called Doka.
The essence of Doka is as follows:
You are given an array
A and an integer
X. You want to calculate how many subarrays of this array have a geometric mean of
X.
Formally, calculate the number of pairs of integers
(L,R) such that
1≤L≤R≤N and
R−L+1
A
L
⋅A
L+1
⋅…⋅A
R
=X
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N,X — the size of the array
A and the required geometric mean.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, on a new line print the number of subarrays that satisfy the condition.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Every subarray has a geometric mean of
3, and there are
6 subarrays in total so the answer is
6.
Test case
2: The only subarray with a geometric mean of
4 is the singleton array
[4], obtained with
L=R=4.
Test case
3: The
6 pairs of
(L,R) which have a geometric mean of
54 are:
(1,2), giving the subarray
[36,81]
(1,3), giving the subarray
[36,81,54]
(1,4), giving the subarray
[36,81,54,54]
(3,3), giving the subarray
[54]
(3,4), giving the subarray
[54,54]
(4,4), giving the subarray
[54]
