You have a matrix
A with dimensions
N×N. Let the disgust of the matrix be defined as:
∑
i=1
N
∑
j=1
N
(A
(i,j)
−A
(j,i)
)

You also have
M tuples with you. Each tuple consists of
3 integers
X
i
,Y
i
, ans
Z
i
(1≤i≤M). In one operation, you can:
Choose an element
(p,q)
(1≤p,q≤N) such that the value of the element
A
(p,q)
=X
i
.
Change the value of the chosen element to
Y
i
.
The cost of applying the above operation is
Z
i
. Note that
(1≤i≤M) and thus, the operation might correspond to any one of the given tuples.
Input Format
The first line contains one integer
T - the number of test cases. Then
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case consists of two integer
N and
M, the row size and the number of tuples.
N lines follow, each consisting of
N space-separated integers - the matrix
A.
M lines follow, each consisting of
3 space-separated integers - each tuple

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum value of
(totalCost
+ disgust
) after applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We convert
A
(1,2)
to
2 for a cost of
2 and we convert
A
(3,1)
to
2 for a cost of
2. The total cost is
2+2=4 and disgust is
(3−3)

+(2−1)

=6. Thus, the value
(totalCost
+ disgust
) for the new matrix is
4+6=10. We can show that this is the minimum value possible.
Test case
2: We do not need to perform any operations. Thus, the value:
(totalCost
+ disgust
)=0+(2−2)
2
+(2−2)
2
+(2−2)
2
+(2−2)

=0.
Test case
3: We perform the following operations:
We choose
A
(1,2)
and change it to
2 for a cost of
1. Then, we further change it to
1 for a cost of
1.
We choose
A
(3,1)
and change it to
2 for a cost of
1. Then, we further change it to
1 for a cost of
1.
We choose
A
(3,2)
and change it to
1 for a cost of
1. The new disgust is
0 while the cost is
5. The value
(totalCost
+ disgust
) for the new matrix is
5. We can verify that this is the minimum possible value.
