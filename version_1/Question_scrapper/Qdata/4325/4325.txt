You are given two binary arrays
A and
B, each of size
N
(N≥3).
You can perform the following operation on array
A:
Select three indexes
i,j, and
k
(1≤i<j<k≤N),
and set
A
j
=A
i
∣
A
j
∣
A
k
. Here
∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Determine whether it is possible to convert the array
A to array
B by applying any (possibly zero) number of given operations.
Note that, in a binary array each element is either
0 or
1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input:
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — size of arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1

A.
The third line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
B

, the elements of array
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES, it is possible to convert the array
A to array
B using any number of given operations. Otherwise, output NO.
You can output each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES are considered the same.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can perform the following operations to make the arrays equal:
Operation
1: Select
i=2,j=3,k=4 and set
A
3
=A
2
∣
A
3
∣
A
4
=1
∣
0
∣
0=1. Thus, the array becomes
A=[0,1,1,0,1].
Operation
2: Select
i=3,j=4,k=5 and set
A
4
=A
3
∣
A
4
∣
A
5
=1
∣
0
∣
1=1. Thus, the array becomes
A=[0,1,1,1,1].
The array
A is thus converted to array
B.
Test case
2: It is not possible to convert the array
A to array
B using any number of given operation.
Test case
3: It is not possible to convert the array
A to array
B using any number of given operation.
