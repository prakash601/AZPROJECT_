The following a tie breaker problem. The best solution will receive one point. All other successful answers will be scored on a curve and receive a fraction of a point based on how close they come to the best answer.
Given a large board (with holes) and set of tetris-like figures (an unlimited source, capable of generating any number of them), try to cover the board as exactly as possible. The source is capable of generating the following pieces:
1)
###
.#.
2)
##.
.##
3)
#.#
###
4)
###
#..
5)
..#
###
#..
6)
#.#
###
.#.

You are allowed to flip and rotate pieces before placing them on the board.
Input
The first line contains two numbers - 100<=n,m<=1000 - the height and the width of the board. The next n lines, each containing m space-separated numbers, are the board description. The symbol '0' is a square which should be filled, the symbol '1' is a square which should not be filled.
Output
First output the number of pieces used, k < 106. Then write k successive descriptions of the used pieces. Each description should be of the form: t - the number of full squares of the piece, followed by t pairs of integers denoting the coordinates of the respective squares (using 0-based offsets, with the top-left of input written as (0,0) ).
Example
Input:
3 3
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0


Output:
2
4
0 0
0 1
1 1
0 2

0 2
1 2
2 2
2 1
Scoring
For each square you will receive a penalty, calculated in the following way: Let a be the number a square should be covered by (either 0 or 1), and let b be the actual number of times the square has been covered by a # piece (pieces may overlap). If a > b (the square should have been covered, but was not), the penalty is 3. If b > a (the square should not have be covered and was covered, or should have been covered, but was covered more than once), the penalty is b-a. The total penalty is the sum of individual penalties, taken over all squares.
In the example the penalty is 3+3+1+1 = 8.
The program will be run several times for different data sets and the overall score will be the mean of scores received.
Tests
All tests have been randomly generated, with 1 covering less than 40% of the total number of squares.
