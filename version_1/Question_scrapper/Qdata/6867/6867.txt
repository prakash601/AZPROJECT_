There are
N people lost in a forest, and each person has a radio. The
i-th person's radio can transmit
K
i
frequencies. Let the list of frequencies that the
i-th person can transmit be
F
i
=[f
(i,1)
,f
(i,2)
,…,f
(i,K
i
)
].
The
i-th person and
j-th person can communicate with each other if at least one of the following holds true:
They can both transmit a common frequency i.e. (
f
(i,a)
=f
(j,b)
for some
a,b).
There exists a person
k who can communicate with both
i-th person and
j-th person.
You want to ensure that every pair of people can communicate with each other. To do so, you can perform the following operation:
You can transfer a frequency from one person's radio to another, i.e. select
i and
j
(1≤i,j≤N), delete a frequency
x (present in
F
i
) from
F
i
, and append it to
F
j
.
Determine the minimum number of operations to ensure that every pair of people can communicate with each other. If it is not possible, print
−1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of people
The next
N lines describe the list of frequencies for each person.
The
i-th of these
N lines contains an integer
K
i
, the number of frequencies the radio of the
i-th person can transmit. This is followed by
K
i
unique integers:
f
(i,1)
,f
(i,2)
,…,f
(i,K
i
)
, describing the list of frequencies for the
i-th person.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations to ensure that every pair of people can communicate with each other.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: We can transfer frequency
5 from person
3 to person
1. We need only
1 operation in this case.
Test Case 2: We need a minimum of
3 operations. One possible sequence of operations is:
Transfer frequency
5 from person
2 to person
1
Transfer frequency
7 from person
4 to person
3
Transfer frequency
13 from person
6 to person
5
Test Case 3: It can be shown that it's impossible to ensure that every pair of people can communicate with each other, using any number of operations. So the answer for this case is
−1.
