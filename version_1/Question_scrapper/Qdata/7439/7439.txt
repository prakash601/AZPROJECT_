In the only movie theatre in Chefland, there is a single long row of
M seats. The seats are indexed
1 to
M from left to right. There is exactly one ticket for each individual seat.
N people, numbered
1 to
N, want to buy tickets for seats in this row.
Person
i wants exactly
S
i
number of tickets. They also have a strong preference for viewing angles. Specifically, person
i requires that each of their seats must be indexed between
A
i
and
B
i
. It is guaranteed that
A
i
≥A
i−1
for
2≤i≤N.
For each
i (
1≤i≤N), calculate the largest
j (
i≤j≤N) such that all people from
i to
j can be accommodated together and given tickets according to their requirements.
Input Format
The first line contains
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
M - the number of people and seats respectively.
N lines then follow. The
i-th line contains integers
A
i
,
B
i
, and
S
i
- the acceptable seat indices for person
i and the required number of tickets.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line with
N space-separated integers. The
i-th of these integers should be the largest valid
j (
i≤j≤N) such that all people from
i to
j can be accommodated together.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
i=1: It can be shown that person
2 cannot be accommodated with person
1. The maximum valid
j in this case is
1 itself.
i=2: We can accommodate persons
2 and
3 together, and more people after person
3 cannot be accommodated. One way to do this is by ensuring that the set of seats assigned to person
2 is
{3,4,6,7,8} and to person
3 is
{5}.
i=3: We can accommodate persons
3 and
4 together, and more people after person
4 cannot be accommodated. One way to do this is by ensuring that the set of seats assigned to person
3 is
{4} and to person
4 is
{5,6,7,8,9}.
i=4: We cannot accommodate more people after person
4.
i=5: We can accommodate all persons
5,
6, and
7 together. One way to do this is by ensuring that the set of seats assigned to person
5 is
{6}, to person
6 is
{7}, and to person
7 is
{8}.
i=6: We can accommodate persons
6 and
7 together. One way to do this is by ensuring that the set of seats assigned to person
6 is
{7} and to person
7 is
{8}.
i=7: The maximum
j possible is
7 itself.
