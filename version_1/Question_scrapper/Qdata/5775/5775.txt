Chef is the leader of Chef's Earth Defense Organization, and his mission is to counter aliens which are threatening the earth. According to information gathered by the organization, there are
N alien spaceships (numbered
1 through
N) planning to invade the earth. The
i-th spaceship will appear on the radar at time
C
i
. Each spaceship needs
D time to reach earth once it appears on the radar.
Chef's organization owns a huge laser cannon which can destroy one spaceship in one shot. However, once the cannon is used once it needs some amount of cool-down time in order to be used again (first shot doesn't require cool-down time before it is used). This cool-down time, however, is configurable. It has to be set before the first shot, and cannot be changed after that. If Chef sets a lower cool-down time, that would increase the energy consumed by the cannon, and vice-versa - the higher the cool-down time, the lower the energy consumed.
This might be a long battle, and Chef wants to use as little energy as possible. So Chef wants to maximize the cool-down time while still being able to destroy all spaceships before any of them arrive on earth. In particular, the
i-th spaceship should be shot between the times
C
i
and
C
i
+D (both end points inclusive).
###Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
D.
