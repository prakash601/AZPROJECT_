Robert is a maths teacher and he made a question for his students. Question is a matrix of
N X
N with all distinct elements from
1 to
N∗N. One has to apply maxpool function of filter matrix
2 X
2 to get the answer, that is for each
2 X
2 matrix you have to write the maximum element in corresponding matrix of size
(N−1) X
(N−1).
for example if
N =
3 and matrix given is
1 7 4
2 3 5
9 8 6
then after applying maxpool function we get:
7 7
9 8
Robert is a careless person and forgot the actual question or
N X
N matrix but he knows the answer or
(N−1) X
(N−1) matrix.
Can you help him to derive any valid question matrix(must contain all the numbers from
1 to
N *
N ) back from the answer given?
Inputs are given in such a way that the answer always exists. In case of multiple answers print any.
###Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N:- The size of the question matrix or matrix before the filter is applied.
Next
(N−1) lines contains
(N−1) space-seperated integers in each line.
Output
For each test case, print the matrix of size
N X
N . Print
N lines where each line will contain
N integers separated by a space.
Constraints
1≤T≤5
2≤N≤200
1≤A[i][j]≤(N∗N) , for all
1≤i,j≤(N−1), and
A is the matrix after the filter is applied.
