An array
B of length
M consisting of only distinct elements is said to be good if the following condition holds:
Let
i be the index of the maximum element of
B.
Then,
B[1,i] must be in ascending order, i.e,
B
1
<B
2
<B
3
<…<B
i
.
For example,
[1,2,3],[1,4,3,2] and
[1,3,2] are good arrays, while
[2,1,3] and
[3,2,4,1] are not.
You are given a permutation
P of length
N. You have to partition
P into some non-empty good subarrays. Note that every element of
P should be contained in exactly one subarray.
Find the total number of valid partitions.
Since the answer can be quite large, please print it modulo
998244353.
Note: A permutation of length
N is an arrangement of the integers
{1,2,3,…,N}.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the length of
P.
The second line contains
N space-separated distinct integers
P

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of valid partitions modulo
998244353.
