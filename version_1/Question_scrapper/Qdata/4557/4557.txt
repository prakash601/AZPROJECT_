Chef and Chefina are playing a game. There are two piles numbered
1 and
2.
Pile
1 contains
X stones while Pile
2 contains
Y stones.
Chef starts the game.
In his turn, Chef can either remove
1 stone each from both the piles or remove
2 stones from pile
1.
On the other hand, Chefina, in her turn, can either remove
1 stone each from both the piles or remove
2 stones from pile
2.
The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine the winner if both players play optimally.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers
X and
Y, the initial number of stones in piles
1 and
2 respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output CHEF if Chef wins the game, and CHEFINA otherwise.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings CHEF, chef, Chef, and cHEf are all considered identical.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider the following sequence of moves:
Chef removes
1 stone each from both the piles. Thus, pile
1 has no stone left while pile
2 has
9 stones left.
Chefina removes
2 stones from pile
2. Thus, pile
1 has no stones left while pile
2 has
7 stones left.
Since Chef has no valid move, he loses. Note that this might not be an optimal sequence of moves.
Test case
2: Consider the following sequence of moves:
Chef removes
1 stone each from both the piles. Thus, pile
1 has
1 stone left and pile
2 has
1 stone left.
Chefina removes
1 stone each from both the piles. Thus, pile
1 has no stones left and pile
2 has no stones left.
Since Chef has no valid move, he loses. Note that this might not be an optimal sequence of moves.
