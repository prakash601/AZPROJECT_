You are given an array
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
of length
N. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly 0 times) :
Choose any two indices
i and
j and replace either
A
i
or
A
j
with
gcd(A
i
,A
j
).
Find the minimum possible sum (ie.
A
1
+A
2
+⋯+A
N
) that you can achieve, and output that.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum sum of the array that can be achieved.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Choose
i=1,j=2 and replace
A
2
with
gcd(5,10)=5.
Test case
2: Choose
i=1,j=3 and replace
A
3
with
gcd(2,6)=2.
