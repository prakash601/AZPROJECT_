You are given two integers
N and
X. Output an array
A of length
N such that:
−1000≤A
i
≤1000 for all
1≤i≤N.
All
A
i
are distinct.
mean(A)=X.
If there are multiple answers, print any. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints at least one array satisfying the given conditions exists.
As a reminder, the mean of an array
B of size
M is defined as:
mean(B)=
M
∑
i=1
M
B
i
.
For example,
mean([3,1,4,8])=
4
3+1+4+8
=
4
16
=4.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
N and
X - the size of the array
A and the mean of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output an array
A of length
N which satisfies the given conditions.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1000
0≤X≤100
