You are given an array
a
of length
n
and array
b
of length
m
both consisting of only integers
0
and
1
. Consider a matrix
c
of size
n×m
formed by following rule:
ci,j=ai⋅bj
(i.e.
ai
multiplied by
bj
). It's easy to see that
c
consists of only zeroes and ones too.
How many subrectangles of size (area)
k
consisting only of ones are there in
c
?
A subrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers
x1,x2,y1,y2
(
1≤x1≤x2≤n
,
1≤y1≤y2≤m
) a subrectangle
c[x1…x2][y1…y2]
is an intersection of the rows
x1,x1+1,x1+2,…,x2
and the columns
y1,y1+1,y1+2,…,y2
.
The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
1≤n,m≤40000,1≤k≤n⋅m
), length of array
a
, length of array
b
and required size of subrectangles.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤1
), elements of
a
.
The third line contains
m
integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
0≤bi≤1
), elements of
b
.
Output
Output single integer — the number of subrectangles of
c
with size (area)
k
consisting only of ones.
