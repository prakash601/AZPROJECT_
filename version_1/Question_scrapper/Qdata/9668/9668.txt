In the famous Oh-Suit-United tournament, two teams are playing against each other for the grand prize of precious pepper points.
The first team consists of
n
players, and the second team consists of
m
players. Each player has a potential: the potential of the
i
-th player in the first team is
ai
, and the potential of the
i
-th player in the second team is
bi
.
In the tournament, all players will be on the stage in some order. There will be a scoring device, initially assigned to an integer
k
, which will be used to value the performance of all players.
The scores for all players will be assigned in the order they appear on the stage. Let the potential of the current player be
x
, and the potential of the previous player be
y
(
y
equals
x
for the first player). Then,
x−y
is added to the value in the scoring device, Afterwards, if the value in the scoring device becomes negative, the value will be reset to
0
. Lastly, the player's score is assigned to the current value on the scoring device. The score of a team is the sum of the scores of all its members.
As an insane fan of the first team, Nezzar desperately wants the biggest win for the first team. He now wonders what is the maximum difference between scores of the first team and the second team.
Formally, let the score of the first team be
scoref
and the score of the second team be
scores
. Nezzar wants to find the maximum value of
scoref−scores
over all possible orders of players on the stage.
However, situation often changes and there are
q
events that will happen. There are three types of events:
1
pos
x
— change
apos
to
x
;
2
pos
x
— change
bpos
to
x
;
3
x
— tournament is held with
k=x
and Nezzar wants you to compute the maximum value of
scoref−scores
.
Can you help Nezzar to answer the queries of the third type?
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
q
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅105,1≤q≤5⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤106
).
The third line contains
m
integers
b1,b2,…,bm
(
0≤bi≤106
).
The following
q
lines contain descriptions of events, described in the statement, each in one of the three possible formats:
1
pos
x
(
1≤pos≤n
,
0≤x≤106
);
2
pos
x
(
1≤pos≤m
,
0≤x≤106
);
3
x
(
0≤x≤106
).
Output
For each query of the third type print the answer to this query.

Note
In the first query of the first test, the tournament is held with
k=5
. It would be optimal to arrange players in such way (here their potentials are written):
7
_
,
3
,
5
,
4
,
6
,
1
_
,
2
_
(underlined numbers are potentials of players that are from the first team).
The individual scores of players, numbered in the order of their appearance, are:
max(5+(7−7),0)=5
for the
1
_
-st player;
max(5+(3−7),0)=1
for the
2
-nd player;
max(1+(5−3),0)=3
for the
3
-rd player;
max(3+(4−5),0)=2
for the
4
-th player;
max(2+(6−4),0)=4
for the
5
-th player;
max(4+(1−6),0)=0
for the
6
_
-th player;
max(0+(2−1),0)=1
for the
7
_
-th player.
So,
scoref=5+0+1=6
and
scores=1+3+2+4=10
. The score difference is
6−10=−4
. It can be proven, that it is the maximum possible score difference.
