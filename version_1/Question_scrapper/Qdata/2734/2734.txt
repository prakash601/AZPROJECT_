Now, as you're familiar with operating on arrays, let's do an intricate task. Here, we'll do swapping of array elements.
Given an array A of N positive integers. The task is to swap every ith element of the array with (i+2)th element.
Input Format:
First line of input contains number of testcase T. For each testcase, there will be two lines, first of which contains size of array N and next line contains N space seperated positive integers.
Output Format:
For each testcase, print the modified array.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
3 <= N <= 106
1 <= Ai <= 106
User Task:
Your task is to complete the function swapElements(), which should swap each ith element with (i+2)th element.
Example:
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
3 4 5 2 1
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Swapping 1 and 3, makes the array 3 2 1 4 5. Now, swapping 2 and 4, makes the array 3 4 1 2 5. Again, swapping 1 and 5, makes the array 3 4 5 2 1.
