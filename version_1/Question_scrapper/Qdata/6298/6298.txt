Chef has a sequence
A

,…,A
N
. Let's call a contiguous subsequence of
A a segment.
A segment is good if it can be divided into at most
K segments such that the sum of elements in each of these sub-segments is at most
S.
You need to find the maximum number of elements in a good segment.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
K and
S.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum length of a good segment.

Explanation:
Example case 1: One of the segments with length
4 is
[1,3,2,1]. It can be divided into two segments
[1,3] and
[2,1] whose sums are at most
S=5.
