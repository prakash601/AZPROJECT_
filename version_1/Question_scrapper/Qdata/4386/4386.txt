You are given a binary string
S of length
N.
You have to construct a binary string
X, of length
N, such that:
For each
(1≤i<N),
X
(i+1)
=(X
i
⊕S
i
), where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation;
The count of
1s in the string
X is maximised.
Find the maximum count of
1 in string
X.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the length of the string
S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum count of
1 in string
X.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
5
1≤N≤3⋅10

S consists of
0 and
1 only.
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
3⋅10
