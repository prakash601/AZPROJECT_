Recently, Chef found a new formula for computing powers of a sequence:
You are given two sequences
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and
(l
1
,r
1
),(l
2
,r
2
),…,(l
N
,r
N
).
The
1-st power of the sequence
A is
A
1
=A.
For each
k>1, the
k-th power of the sequence
A (denoted by
A
k
) is a sequence with length
N such that for each valid
i, the
i-th element of this sequence is
(A
k
)
i
=(A
k−1
)
l
i
⊕(A
k−1
)
l
i
+1
⊕…⊕(A
k−1
)
r
i
−1
⊕(A
k−1
)
r
i
.
After discovering this new formula, Chef tried to find
A
K
, but he felt that it is very time consuming. Therefore, Chef wants you to do it. Can you find the
K-th power of
A for Chef?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
l
i
and
r
i
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
(A
K
)

,(A
K
)
2
,…,(A
K
)
N
.
