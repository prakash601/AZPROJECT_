There is an array
a
of
230
integers, indexed from
0
to
230−1
. Initially, you know that
0≤ai<230
(
0≤i<230
), but you do not know any of the values. Your task is to process queries of two types:
1 l r x: You are informed that the bitwise xor of the subarray
[l,r]
(ends inclusive) is equal to
x
. That is,
al⊕al+1⊕…⊕ar−1⊕ar=x
, where
⊕
is the bitwise xor operator. In some cases, the received update contradicts past updates. In this case, you should ignore the contradicting update (the current update).
2 l r: You are asked to output the bitwise xor of the subarray
[l,r]
(ends inclusive). If it is still impossible to know this value, considering all past updates, then output
−1
.
Note that the queries are encoded. That is, you need to write an online solution.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅105
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines describes a query. It contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2
) — the type of query.
The given queries will be encoded in the following way: let
last
be the answer to the last query of the second type that you have answered (initially,
last=0
). If the last answer was
−1
, set
last=1
.
If
t=1
, three integers follow,
l′
,
r′
, and
x′
(
0≤l′,r′,x′<230
), meaning that you got an update. First, do the following:
l=l′⊕last
,
r=r′⊕last
,
x=x′⊕last
and, if
l>r
, swap
l
and
r
.
This means you got an update that the bitwise xor of the subarray
[l,r]
is equal to
x
(notice that you need to ignore updates that contradict previous updates).
If
t=2
, two integers follow,
l′
and
r′
(
0≤l′,r′<230
), meaning that you got a query. First, do the following:
l=l′⊕last
,
r=r′⊕last
and, if
l>r
, swap
l
and
r
.
For the given query, you need to print the bitwise xor of the subarray
[l,r]
. If it is impossible to know, print
−1
. Don't forget to change the value of
last
.
It is guaranteed there will be at least one query of the second type.
Output
After every query of the second type, output the bitwise xor of the given subarray or
−1
if it is still impossible to know.

Note
In the first example, the real queries (without being encoded) are:
12
2 1 2
2 0 1073741823
1 1 2 5
2 1 1
2 2 2
2 1 2
1 2 3 6
2 1 1
1 1 3 0
2 1 1
2 2 2
2 3 3
The answers for the first two queries are
−1
because we don't have any such information on the array initially.
The first update tells us
a1⊕a2=5
. Note that we still can't be certain about the values
a1
or
a2
independently (for example, it could be that
a1=1,a2=4
, and also
a1=3,a2=6
).
After we receive all three updates, we have enough information to deduce
a1,a2,a3
independently.
In the second example, notice that after the first two updates we already know that
a5⊕a6=12
, so the third update is contradicting, and we ignore it.
