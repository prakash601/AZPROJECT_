Given an array Arr of N positive integers and another number X. Determine whether or not there exist two elements in Arr whose sum is exactly X.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 6, X = 16
Arr[] = {1, 4, 45, 6, 10, 8}
Output: Yes
Explanation: Arr[3] + Arr[4] = 6 + 10 = 16
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5, X = 10
Arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 6}
Output: Yes
Explanation: Arr[2] + Arr[4] = 4 + 6 = 10
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function hasArrayTwoCandidates() which takes the array of integers arr, n and x as parameters and returns a boolean denoting the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 105
