You are given a rooted tree with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N); node
1 is the root. For each valid
i, the
i-th node has a value
v
i
and another parameter
m
i
.
A leaf is a node without sons. Let's denote the number of leaf nodes in the tree by
L and their numbers by
l
1
,l
2
,…,l
L
, in increasing order. Then, for each valid
i, let's define the answer for the leaf
l
i
in the following way:
Consider the path from the root to
l
i
. For each node on this path (including the root and this leaf), choose a non-negative integer and multiply the value of this node by it.
Sum up the resulting values of all nodes on this path.
The answer
a
i
for this leaf is defined as the maximum possible remainder of this sum modulo
m
l
i
.
Find the answers for all leaves.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the following
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
y denoting that nodes
x and
y are connected by an edge.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
v

The last line contains
N space-separated integers
m

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
