Salmon runs a fish delivery company in Fish City. Fish City has
N vertical roads numbered
1,2,...,N from left to right, each spaced 1 unit apart; similarly, there are
M horizontal roads numbered
1,2,...,M from bottom to top, each spaced 1 unit apart. We will denote the intersection between the
x-th vertical road and the
y-th horizontal road as
(x,y).
Salmon has to make
K deliveries, with the
i-th delivery starting at
(x
i
,y
i
) and ending at
(x
i
′
,y
i
′
). He can also travel every road with speed
0.5 (meaning it would take him
2 units of time to travel
1 unit of distance). However, Salmon can bribe the mayor of Fish City and make the mayor change exactly one horizontal road to a highway, meaning the speed on that road would increase to
1.
He wants to choose a road to be a highway such that the sum of durations of all the deliveries is minimum possible. Help him find this minimum sum!
Note that each delivery starts exactly at
(x
i
,y
i
) and ends at
(x
i
′
,y
i
′
), i.e., we don't count the time taken to travel from
(x
i−1
′
,y
i−1
′
) to
(x
i
,y
i
) in our answer.
###Input: The first line contains 3 integers,
N,
M and
K (
1≤N,M,K≤10
5
).
The next
K lines describe deliveries. Each line contains 4 space-separated integers
x
i
,
y
i
,
x

,
y
i

(
1≤x

,x

≤N,
1≤y
i
,y

≤M), describing the
i-th delivery.
###Output: Print one integer -- the minimum sum of durations possible.

Salmon can turn the 3rd horizontal road into a highway.
For the first delivery, we can go 2 units to the right taking 2 units of time, and 2 units down taking 4 units of time. The time taken is
2+4=6.
For the second delivery, we can go 1 unit down taking 2 units of time, 4 units right taking 4 units of time, and 1 unit down taking 2 units of time. The time taken is
2+4+2=8.
For the third delivery, we can go 2 units right taking 2 units of time.
Therefore, the total time taken is
6+8+2=16.

Salmon can turn the 1st horizontal road into a highway.
For the first delivery, we can go 1 unit down taking 2 units of time, 9 units right taking 9 units of time, and 1 unit up taking 2 units of time. The time taken is
2+9+2=13.
For the second delivery, we can go 7 units right taking 7 units of time.
For the third delivery, we can go 3 units to the right taking 3 units of time.
Therefore, the total time taken is
13+7+3=23.
