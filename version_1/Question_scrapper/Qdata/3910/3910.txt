Chef is confused by all the different formats dates can be written in. Here's a simple problem Chef wants you to solve.
You are given a date string
S. The date follows the Gregorian calendar, the one used in most parts of the world.
Identify whether it is of the form DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY, or if it can be of both forms. Here DD denotes the 2-digit day, MM denotes the 2-digit month and YYYY denotes the 4-digit year.
It is guaranteed that
S is a valid date taking at least one of these forms.
For example,
21/05/2001 is of the form DD/MM/YYYY and not MM/DD/YYYY.
10/15/2069 is of the form MM/DD/YYYY and not DD/MM/YYYY.
05/11/1999 can be of both forms.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line containing a string of
10 characters
S — the date string
S, which is of the form DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY. It is guaranteed that
S is a valid date taking at least one of these forms.
Output Format
For each test case, output "BOTH" if the date string satisfies both forms. Otherwise output "DD/MM/YYYY" if it is of the form DD/MM/YYYY, else "MM/DD/YYYY". Note that the output may be case-insensitive. So "DD/MM/YYYY", "dd/mm/yyyy" and so on will be considered the same.
Constraints
1≤T≤2023
S is of the form DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY

29/02/2024
DD/MM/YYYY
MM/DD/YYYY
