You are given a tree with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). For each valid
i, node
i has a value
A
i
.
You should answer
Q queries. In each query:
You are given two nodes
a and
b.
Let
S denote the set of all nodes on the simple path between the nodes
a and
b (including these nodes).
Find the minimum value of
∣A
x
−A
y
∣ over all pairs
x,y∈S such that
x

=y.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that nodes
u and
v are connected by an edge.
Each of the last
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
a and
b describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
For the first query,
S={5,6}, so the answer is
∣A
5
−A
6
∣=1.
For the second query,
S={3,2,1,5} and we can see that
∣A
3
−A
5
∣=0.
For the third query,
S={1,2,4}.
