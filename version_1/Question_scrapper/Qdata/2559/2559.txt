Given a string S, the task is to change the complete string to Uppercase or Lowercase depending upon the case for the first character.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "abCD"
Output: abcd
Explanation: The first letter (a) is 
lowercase. Hence, the complete string
is made lowercase.
â€‹Example 2:
Input: 
S = "Abcd"
Output: ABCD
: The first letter (A) is
uppercase. Hence, the complete string
is made uppercase.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string with stated modifications.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) for C++ and O(|S|) for output in Java/Python.

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=104
