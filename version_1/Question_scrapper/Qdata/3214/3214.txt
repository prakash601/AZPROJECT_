Given a number N. You have to check whether every bit in the binary representation of the given number is set or not.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
Output:
1
Explanation:
Binary for 7 is 111 all the
bits are set so output is 1
Example 2:
Input:
N = 8
Output:
0
Binary for 8 is 1000 all the
bits are not set so output is 0.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isBitSet() which takes an integer N as input parameters and returns 1 if all the bits in N's binary representation is set or return 0 otherwise.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Constraints:
0<=N<=100000
