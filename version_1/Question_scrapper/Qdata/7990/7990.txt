Baltic, a famous chess player who is also a mathematician, has an array
a1,a2,…,an
, and he can perform the following operation several (possibly
0
) times:
Choose some index
i
(
1≤i≤n
);
multiply
ai
with
−1
, that is, set
ai:=−ai
.
Baltic's favorite number is
m
, and he wants
a1+a2+⋯+am
to be the smallest of all non-empty prefix sums. More formally, for each
k=1,2,…,n
it should hold that
a1+a2+⋯+ak≥a1+a2+⋯+am.
Please note that multiple smallest prefix sums may exist and that it is only required that
a1+a2+⋯+am
is one of them.
Help Baltic find the minimum number of operations required to make
a1+a2+⋯+am
the least of all prefix sums. It can be shown that a valid sequence of operations always exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤10000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤m≤n≤2⋅105
) — the size of Baltic's array and his favorite number.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
) — the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of required operations.

Note
In the first example, we perform the operation
a4:=−a4
. The array becomes
[−1,−2,−3,4]
and the prefix sums,
[a1, a1+a2, a1+a2+a3, a1+a2+a3+a4]
, are equal to
[−1,−3,−6,−2]
. Thus
a1+a2+a3=−6
is the smallest of all prefix sums.
In the second example, we perform the operation
a3:=−a3
. The array becomes
[1,2,−3,4]
with prefix sums equal to
[1,3,0,4]
.
In the third and fourth examples,
a1+a2+⋯+am
is already the smallest of the prefix sums — no operation needs to be performed.
In the fifth example, a valid sequence of operations is:
a3:=−a3
,
a2:=−a2
,
a5:=−a5
.
The array becomes
[−2,−3,5,−5,20]
and its prefix sums are
[−2,−5,0,−5,15]
. Note that
a1+a2=−5
and
a1+a2+a3+a4=−5
are both the smallest of the prefix sums (and this is a valid solution).
