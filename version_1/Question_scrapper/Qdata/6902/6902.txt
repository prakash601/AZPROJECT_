An array
B=[B
1
,B
2
,B
3
,…,B
N
] is called a good array if the following condition holds for every
1≤i≤N:
B
i
is either the maximum or the minimum element in the subarray
[B
1
,B
2
,…,B
i
].
You are given an array
A containing
N integers. Find the number of its distinct rearrangements that are good.
Two rearrangements
B and
C are considered different if there exists an index
i such that
B
i

=C
i
.
In particular,
A=[1,2,2] has three distinct rearrangements:
[1,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,1].
Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the size of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of good rearrangements, modulo
10

+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The good rearrangements are:
[1,2,3],
[2,1,3],
[3,2,1],
[2,3,1].
Test case
2: The good rearrangements are:
[3,3,4,8],[3,4,8,3],[3,4,3,8],[4,8,3,3],[4,3,8,3],[4,3,3,8],[8,4,3,3].
[3,3,8,4] for example is not a good rearrangement, because
4 is neither the maximum nor the minimum of all the elements before it.
