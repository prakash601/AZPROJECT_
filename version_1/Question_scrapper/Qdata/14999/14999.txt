Greg has a pad. The pad's screen is an n × m rectangle, each cell can be either black or white. We'll consider the pad rows to be numbered with integers from 1 to n from top to bottom. Similarly, the pad's columns are numbered with integers from 1 to m from left to right.
Greg thinks that the pad's screen displays a cave if the following conditions hold:
There is a segment [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), such that each of the rows l, l + 1, ..., r has exactly two black cells and all other rows have only white cells.
There is a row number t (l ≤ t ≤ r), such that for all pairs of rows with numbers i and j (l ≤ i ≤ j ≤ t) the set of columns between the black cells in row i (with the columns where is these black cells) is the subset of the set of columns between the black cells in row j (with the columns where is these black cells). Similarly, for all pairs of rows with numbers i and j (t ≤ i ≤ j ≤ r) the set of columns between the black cells in row j (with the columns where is these black cells) is the subset of the set of columns between the black cells in row i (with the columns where is these black cells).
Greg wondered, how many ways there are to paint a cave on his pad. Two ways can be considered distinct if there is a cell that has distinct colors on the two pictures.
Help Greg.
Input
The first line contains two integers n, m — the pad's screen size (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000).
Output
In the single line print the remainder after dividing the answer to the problem by 1000000007 (109 + 7).
