Given a Binary Search Tree that contains positive integer values greater than 0. The task is to complete the function isDeadEnd which returns true if the BST contains a dead end else returns false. Here Dead End means, we are not able to insert any element after that node.
Example 1:
Input : 
  8
 / \ 
 5 9
 / \ 
 2 7 
 /
 1 
 
Output :
Yes
Node "1" is the dead End because after that 
  we cant insert any element.
Example 2:
Input : 
  8
 / \ 
 7 10
 / / \
 2 9 13

Output :
Yes
Explanation :
We can't insert any element at 
 node 9.  
Your Task:
You don't have to input or print anything. Complete the function isDeadEnd() which takes the input parameter head and returns a boolean value.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the Number of nodes in a given binary tree.
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=200
