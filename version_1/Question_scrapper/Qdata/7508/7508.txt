Chef, who is a chef by profession as well, has created
N pies (enumerated
1 through
N) and has placed them in a row. Now he wants to taste all the pies, but by following a rather peculiar order of tasting.
At each step, he chooses (uniformly randomly and independently) either the current leftmost pie or the rightmost pie, and eats that pie.
For example, if
N=7, then one valid order of tasting the pies is
(1,2,7,3,4,6,5). However,
(1,2,7,6,4,5,3) is not a valid order.
Chef can't wait to taste all the pies, so for each
i
(1≤i≤N), he wants to know the expected value of the number of steps he'll need to eat the
i
th
pie.
It can be shown that each expected value can be expressed as a fraction
Q
P
. You should compute
P⋅Q
−1
modulo
10
9
+7, where
Q
−1
denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of
Q under
10
9
+7
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer
N — the number of pies.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers, the
i
th
of which is the expected number of steps Chef needs to eat the
i
th
pie.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
There are
3 ways of eating the
1
st
pie:
(1) : The probability of this ordering is
2
1
and number of steps is
1
(3,1) : The probability of this ordering is
4
1
and number of steps is
2
(3,2,1) : The probability of this ordering is
4
1
and number of steps is
3
Therefore, the expected number of steps for the

pie:
(1,2) : The probability of this ordering is
