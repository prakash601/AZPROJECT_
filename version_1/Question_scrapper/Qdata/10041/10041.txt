Everybody knows that Balázs has the fanciest fence in the whole town. It's built up from
N
fancy sections. The sections are rectangles standing closely next to each other on the ground. The
i
th section has integer height
hi
and integer width
wi
. We are looking for fancy rectangles on this fancy fence. A rectangle is fancy if:
its sides are either horizontal or vertical and have integer lengths
the distance between the rectangle and the ground is integer
the distance between the rectangle and the left side of the first section is integer
it's lying completely on sections
What is the number of fancy rectangles? This number can be very big, so we are interested in it modulo
109+7
.
Input
The first line contains
N
(
1≤N≤105
) – the number of sections. The second line contains
N
space-separated integers, the
i
th number is
hi
(
1≤hi≤109
). The third line contains
N
space-separated integers, the
i
th number is
wi
(
1≤wi≤109
).
Output
You should print a single integer, the number of fancy rectangles modulo
109+7
. So the output range is
0,1,2,…,109+6
.
