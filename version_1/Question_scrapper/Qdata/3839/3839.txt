Alice and Bob recently got into running, and decided to compare how much they ran on different days.
They each ran for
N days — on the
i
th
day, Alice ran
A
i
meters and Bob ran
B
i
meters.
On each day,
Alice is unhappy if Bob ran strictly more than twice her distance, and happy otherwise.
Similarly, Bob is unhappy if Alice ran strictly more than twice his distance, and happy otherwise.
For example, on a given day
If Alice ran
500 meters and Bob ran
240, Alice would be happy and Bob would be unhappy.
If Alice ran
300 meters and Bob ran
500, both Alice and Bob would be happy.
On how many of the
N days were both Alice and Bob happy?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of days.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alice is unhappy on the first day, since she ran
100 meters but Bob ran
300; and
300 is more than twice of
100.
Similarly, Bob is unhappy on the third day.
Both Alice and Bob are happy on the second day, so the answer is
1.
Test case
2: Bob is unhappy on day
1 and happy on every other day, while Alice is happy on every day. So, they're both happy on three days — the second, third, and fourth.
Test case
3: Alice is unhappy on days
1,2,3 and Bob is unhappy on day
4.
Test case
4: Alice and Bob are both happy on all five days.
