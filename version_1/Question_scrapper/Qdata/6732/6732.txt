Chef and Chefina are playing a game involving
N piles where the
i
th
pile
(1≤i≤N) has
A
i
stones initially.
They take alternate turns with Chef starting the game.
In his/her turn a player can choose any non-empty pile (say
i
th
pile) and remove
X stones from it iff:
Parity of
X is same as parity of
i.
1≤X≤A
i
.
The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of piles.
Next line contains
N space-separated integers
A

N
- denoting the number of stones in each pile initially.
Output Format
For each test case, output CHEF if Chef wins the game, CHEFINA otherwise.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings Chef, CHEF, chef, and cheF are all considered identical.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef makes the first move and can only remove
X=1 stone from the pile. Thus, the pile has
1 stone left which Chefina can remove. Chef has no possible move left and thus Chefina wins.
Note that Chef cannot remove
X=2 stones in the first turn as
X should have the same parity as
i=1.
Test case
2: It can be shown that if both players play optimally, Chef wins the game.
