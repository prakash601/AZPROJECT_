You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. The array is sorted if
a1≤a2≤⋯≤an
.
You want to make the array
a
sorted by applying the following operation exactly once:
choose an integer
x
, then for every
i∈[1,n]
, replace
ai
by
|ai−x|
.
Find any value of
x
that will make the array sorted, or report that there is no such value.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅104
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
). The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤108
).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print any integer
x
(
0≤x≤109
) that makes the array sorted. It can be shown that if such an integer
x
exists, there is at least one such integer between
0
and
109
.
If there is no such integer, then print
−1
. If there are multiple suitable values of
x
, print any of them.

Note
In the first test case, after using
x=4
, the array becomes
[1,1,1,1,1]
.
In the third test case, after using
x=0
, the array becomes
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
.
In the fourth test case, after using
x=42
, the array becomes
[32,37,38,39,40,41]
.
