We will consider the numbers
a
and
b
as adjacent if they differ by exactly one, that is,
|a−b|=1
.
We will consider cells of a square matrix
n×n
as adjacent if they have a common side, that is, for cell
(r,c)
cells
(r,c−1)
,
(r,c+1)
,
(r−1,c)
and
(r+1,c)
are adjacent to it.
For a given number
n
, construct a square matrix
n×n
such that:
Each integer from
1
to
n2
occurs in this matrix exactly once;
If
(r1,c1)
and
(r2,c2)
are adjacent cells, then the numbers written in them must not be adjacent.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is characterized by one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
).
Output
For each test case, output:
-1, if the required matrix does not exist;
the required matrix, otherwise (any such matrix if many of them exist).
The matrix should be outputted as
n
lines, where each line contains
n
integers.
