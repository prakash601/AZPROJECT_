Consider the following operations on a triple of integers. In one operation, you should:
Choose an integer
d and an arithmetic operation ― either addition or multiplication.
Choose a subset of elements of the triple.
Apply the arithmetic operation to each of the chosen elements, i.e. either add
d to each of them or multiply each of them by
d.
For example, if we have a triple
(3,5,7), we may choose to add
3 to the first and third element, and we get
(6,5,10) using one operation.
You are given an initial triple
(p,q,r) and a target triple
(a,b,c). Find the minimum number of operations needed to transform
(p,q,r) into
(a,b,c).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
p,
q and
r.
The second line contains three space-separated integers
a,
b and
c.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum required number of operations.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We add
3 to the first and third element of
(3,5,7) to form
(6,5,10).
Example case 2: We can add
1 to each element to form
(9,7,4) and then multiply the third element by
2.
