You are given arrays
A and
B, each consisting of
N strings, and a positive integer
K.
For all
1≤i≤N, both
A
i
and
B
i
consist of characters from
0 to
9 (both inclusive).
You can perform the following types of operations on array
A:
Type
1: Choose two indices
i and
j
(i

=j) and swap any character of
A
i
with any character of
A
j
. The cost of this operation is
0.
Type
2: Choose an index
i and replace one character of
A
i
with any character from
0 to
9 (both inclusive). The cost of this operation is
1.
For example, let
A=[24,30,51]. A valid sequence of operations can be:
Swap
4 in
A
1
=24 with
0 in
A
2
=30 to obtain
[20,34,51].
Swap
0 in
A
1
=20 with
5 in
A
3
=51 to obtain
[25,34,01].
Replace
0 in
A
3
=01 with
1 to obtain
[25,34,11].
The cost of the above sequence of operations is
1.
Find whether we can convert the array
A to array
B using any (possibly zero) number of operations with cost
≤K.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K, the size of array and the maximum cost of operations.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated strings
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
The third line of each test case contains
N space-separated strings
B
1

2
,…,B
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is possible to convert array
A to
B using any (possibly zero) number of operations with cost
≤K. Else, print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can use one operation of type
1 to swap
1 in
A
1
with
9 in
A
2
. Thus,
A becomes
[9,1], which is equal to
B. We are able to do this with
0 cost, which is
≤2.
Test case
2: It is impossible to convert
A to
B with at most
2 cost.
