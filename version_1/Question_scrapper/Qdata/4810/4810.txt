Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice goes first.
They have a binary circular array
A with
N elements. In one move, a player can:
Choose a circular continuous segment of the array and perform a left cyclic shift on the chosen segment.
We define the term
diff(A) as the number of pairs of adjacent elements with different values. Note that we also consider
A
N
and
A
1
as adjacent.
A player can make a move only if, for the updated array
A
′
,
diff(A
′
)>diff(A).
The player who is unable to make a move, loses. Find the winner of the game if both players play optimally.
Note:
For an array
A with
N elements, some circular continuous segments are
[A
1
],[A
1
,A
2
,A
3
],[A
N−1
,A
N
,A
1
,A
2
], etc.
A left cyclic shift of a segment
[A
1
,A
2
,A
3
] is
[A
2
,A
3
,A
1
]. Similarly, left cyclic shift of segment
[A
N−1
,A
N
,A
1
,A
2
] is
[A
N
,A
1
,A
2
,A
N−1
].
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer 
T, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
Each test cases consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer 
N, the number of elements.
The second line of each test case contains 
N space-separated integers 
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, if Alice will win print Alice, otherwise print Bob.
You may print each character in Uppercase or Lowercase. For example: BOB, bob, boB, and Bob are all identical.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alice can not perform any move. Thus, Bob wins.
Test case
2: Alice can perform the following move:
Choose the segment
[A
1
,A
2
,A
3
] and perform left cyclic shift. Thus,
A becomes
[1,0,1,0].
Also,
diff([1,1,0,0])=2 as pairs of adjacent elements with different values are
(A
2
,A
3
) and
(A
4
,A
1
). After this move,
diff([1,0,1,0])=4 as all pairs of adjacent elements have different values. Since
diff([1,0,1,0])>diff([1,1,0,0]), this move is valid.
After performing the move, Bob has no valid move left. Thus, Alice wins.
