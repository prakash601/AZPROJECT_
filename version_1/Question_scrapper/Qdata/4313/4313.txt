You are given an array
A consisting of
N positive integers and a positive integer
K.
Find whether there exists a subset
S of the elements of
A such that the product of all elements of
S is divisible by
K.
Note that a subset is obtained by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
K — the number of elements of
A and the above mentioned integer
K.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line the answer: YES if there exists a subset
S and NO otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings Yes, YES, yes, yEs` will all be treated as identical.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider the subset
S=[8]. The product of all the elements is
8 which is divisible by
K=2.
Test case
2: There exists no subset of
A such that the product of all elements of the subset is divisible by
K.
Test case
3: Consider the subset
S=[2,3]. The product of all the elements is
6 which is divisible by
K=6.
