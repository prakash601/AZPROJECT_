You are given a grid of (not necessarily non-negative) integers
G with
N rows and
M columns. Let's denote the integer in the cell
(i,j) of this grid by
G
i,j
; the rows and columns use 1-based indexing.
Formally, let's call a non-empty subset of cells of the grid a plus sign if:
it is connected
there is a central cell
(i,j) which belongs to the subset
each other (non-central) cell from the subset is either in row
i or column
j
the central cell is adjacent to 4 other cells in all 4 directions
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of these lines contains
M space-separated integers
G
i,1
,G
i,2
,…,G
i,M
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of a plus sign.
Constraints
