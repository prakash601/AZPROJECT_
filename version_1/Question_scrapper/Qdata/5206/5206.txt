Chefina has an array
A consisting of
N non-negative integers.
The beauty of a subsequence
S is defined as
3
⋅
abs(means(S) - median(S)),
where
mean(S) denotes the mean of subsequence
S and
median(S) denotes the median of subsequence
S.
Now, Chefina asks Chef to choose a subsequence
S of size
3 from array
A such that the beauty of
S is minimised. Your task is to find the minimum beauty possible.
As a reminder, a subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Note: It can be proven that the answer is always an integer.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers, the elements of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum beauty possible of any subsequence of array
A, having length
3.

Explanation:
Test case
1: For the given array
[1,6,8,0], Chef will choose the subsequence
[1,6,8] for minimum beauty.
The mean of subsequence will be
3
(1+6+8)
=5
The median of subsequence will be
6 (as it is the middle element after sorting the subsequence).
The beauty of the subsequence is
3⋅
abs(5-6)
=3.
It can be shown that this is the minimum beauty that can be obtained using any subsequence of size
3.
Test case
2: For the given array
[5,5,7,0,1,0,4,7,9,4], Chef will choose subsequence
[1,4,7] for minimum beauty.
The mean of subsequence will be
3
(1+4+7)
=4
The median of subsequence will be
4 (as it is the middle element after sorting the subsequence).
The beauty of the subsequence is
3⋅
abs(4-4)
=0.
It can be shown that this is the minimum beauty that can be obtained using any subsequence of size
3.
