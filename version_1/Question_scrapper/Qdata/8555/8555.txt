Let's consider Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor, where
t
is a list:

function Euclid(a, b):
    if a < b:
        swap(a, b)

    if b == 0:
        return a

    r = reminder from dividing a by b
    if r > 0:
        append r to the back of t

    return Euclid(b, r)
There is an array
p
of pairs of positive integers that are not greater than
m
. Initially, the list
t
is empty. Then the function is run on each pair in
p
. After that the list
t
is shuffled and given to you.
You have to find an array
p
of any size not greater than
2⋅104
that produces the given list
t
, or tell that no such array exists.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤103
,
1≤m≤109
) — the length of the array
t
and the constraint for integers in pairs.
The second line contains
n
integers
t1,t2,…,tn
(
1≤ti≤m
) — the elements of the array
t
.
Output
If the answer does not exist, output
−1
.
If the answer exists, in the first line output
k
(
1≤k≤2⋅104
) — the size of your array
p
, i. e. the number of pairs in the answer.
The
i
-th of the next
k
lines should contain two integers
ai
and
bi
(
1≤ai,bi≤m
) — the
i
-th pair in
p
.
If there are multiple valid answers you can output any of them.

Note
In the first sample let's consider the array
t
for each pair:
(19,11)
:
t=[8,3,2,1]
;
(15,9)
:
t=[6,3]
;
(3,7)
:
t=[1]
.
So in total
t=[8,3,2,1,6,3,1]
, which is the same as the input
t
(up to a permutation).
In the second test case it is impossible to find such array
p
of pairs that all integers are not greater than
10
and
t=[7,1]
In the third test case for the pair
(15,8)
array
t
will be
[7,1]
.
