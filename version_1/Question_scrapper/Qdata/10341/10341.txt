Note that the only differences between easy and hard versions are the constraints on
n
and the time limit. You can make hacks only if all versions are solved.
Slime is interested in sequences. He defined good positive integer sequences
p
of length
n
as follows:
For each
k>1
that presents in
p
, there should be at least one pair of indices
i,j
, such that
1≤i<j≤n
,
pi=k−1
and
pj=k
.
For the given integer
n
, the set of all good sequences of length
n
is
sn
. For the fixed integer
k
and the sequence
p
, let
fp(k)
be the number of times that
k
appears in
p
. For each
k
from
1
to
n
, Slime wants to know the following value:
(
∑
p∈sn
fp(k)) mod 998244353
Input
The first line contains one integer
n (1≤n≤5000)
.
Output
Print
n
integers, the
i
-th of them should be equal to
(∑p∈snfp(i)) mod 998244353
.
