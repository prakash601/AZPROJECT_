In ShareChat, there is a sequence of binary integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. You should answer
Q queries on this sequence. In each query, you are given two indices
L and
R and a binary integer
X.
The answer to a query is the smallest index
i (
L≤i≤R) such that the value
A
i
⊕X is maximum possible, i.e. equal to
max(A
L
⊕X,A
L+1
⊕X,…,A
R
⊕X). Here,
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
lines follow. For each
(
1≤≤), the
-th of these lines contains a single binary string denoting the number
A
i
(in binary representation).
The following
Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
L and
R, followed by a space and a binary string denoting the number
X (in binary representation).
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to that query.
