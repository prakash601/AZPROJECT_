Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of integers.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

Explanation:
Test case
1: For
B=[0,0,10,0,10], the value of
min(∣B

∣,…,∣B
N
−B
1
∣) is
0. It can be shown that this is the maximum possible value. Other permutations also achieve this value, for example
[0,10,0,10,0], and any such permutation is a valid output.
Test case
2: For
B=[1,10,5,14], the value of
min(∣B
