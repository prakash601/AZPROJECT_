Given a linked list, the task is to move all 0s to the front of the linked list. The order of all another element except 0 should be same after rearrangement.
Example 1:
Input: 0 -> 4 -> 0 -> 5 -> 0
Output: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5
Explanation: After moving all 0s of the given
list to the front, the list is:
0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5
Example 2:
Input: 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2
Output: 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function which takes head node of the linked list as input parameter.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 50
