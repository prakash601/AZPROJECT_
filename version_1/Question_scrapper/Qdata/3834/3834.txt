Explanation:
Test case
1: Total medals for the first country are
10+20+30=60 and that for the second country are
0+29+30=59. So the first country is ranked better than the second country.
Test case

0+0+0=0 and that for the second country are
0+0+1=1. So the second country is ranked better than the first country.
