Little X has met the following problem recently.
Let's define f(x) as the sum of digits in decimal representation of number x (for example, f(1234) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). You are to calculate
Of course Little X has solved this problem quickly, has locked it, and then has tried to hack others. He has seen the following C++ code:

    ans = solve(l, r) % a;
    if (ans <= 0)
      ans += a;

This code will fail only on the test with . You are given number a, help Little X to find a proper test for hack.
Input
The first line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1018).
Output
Print two integers: l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10200) — the required test data. Leading zeros aren't allowed. It's guaranteed that the solution exists.
