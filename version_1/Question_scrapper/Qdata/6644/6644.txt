Danya has a rooted tree with
N nodes (numbered
1 through
N). Node
1 is the root and for each
i (
2≤i≤N), the parent of the
i-th node is
p
i
. For each valid
i, the
i-th node also has a value
a
i
.
Danya really loves his tree and wants to play with it. You should answer his
Q queries. In each query:
You are given two integers
X and
D.
Consider the set
S of all nodes
v that lie in the subtree of node
X (including
X) such that the distance between
X and
v does not exceed
D.
The answer to this query is the number of different values
a
among all
v∈S.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N−1 space-separated integers
p
2
,p
3
,…,p
N
.
The third line contains
N space-separated integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
N
.
The fourth line contains a single integer
Q.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
d describing a query; the parameters
X and
D can be computed in the following way:
Let's denote the answer to the previous query by
ans (
ans=0 if this is the first query).
Then,
X=x⊕ans and
D=d⊕ans, where
⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.
