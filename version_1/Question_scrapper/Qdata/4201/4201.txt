Pushpa has entered Chefland and wants to establish Pushpa-Raj here too.
Chefland has
N towers where the height of the
i
th
tower is
H
i
. To establish Pushpa-Raj, Pushpa does the following:
Initially, Pushpa chooses any tower
i
(1≤i≤N) and lands on the roof of that tower.
Let
X denote the height of the tower Pushpa is currently on, then, Pushpa can land on the roof of any tower
j
(1≤j≤N) such that the height of the
j
th
tower is
(X+1).
Let
i denote the index of the tower on which Pushpa lands, then, the height of all towers except tower
i increases by
1 after each jump including the initial jump.
To establish Pushpa-Raj, Pushpa wants to land at the maximum height possible. Determine the maximum height Pushpa can reach.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer

The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the number of towers
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

denoting the initial heights of each of the towers from the ground.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum height achieved by Pushpa.

Explanation:
Test case
1: If Pushpa chooses to start from tower at index
1 with height of
1 unit, then, the new heights will be
[1,3,2,4]. He can then jump to the
3
rd
tower (with height
2 units). The updated heights of the towers is
[2,4,2,5]. Pushpa is unable to make any more jumps.
The optimal way to in this case is to take an initial jump at tower
4 with height
3. The maximum height Pushpa can reach is
3.
Test case
2: There is only
1 tower so Pushpa reaches the maximum height of
2 units.
