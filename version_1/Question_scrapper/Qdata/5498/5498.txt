In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of
N hills (numbered
1 through
N) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the
i-th hill from the left by
h
i
.
Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it — either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height
h, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than
h; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
For example, suppose we have hills with heights
[7,2,3,5,8]. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height
5, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights
2,
3 and
5 are supplied with water.
Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of reservoirs.
