In the magical land of Byteland, there are three kinds of citizens:
a Bit -
2ms after a Bit appears, it grows up and becomes a Nibble (i.e. it disappears and a Nibble appears)
a Nibble -
8ms after a Nibble appears, it grows up and becomes a Byte
a Byte -
16ms after a Byte appears, it grows up, splits into two Bits and disappears
Chef wants to know the answer to the following question: what would the population of Byteland be immediately before the time
Nms if only 1 Bit appeared at time
0ms?
Help him and find the population (number of citizens) of each type.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing three space-separated integers — the number of Bits, Nibbles and Bytes.

Explanation:
Immediately before the time
2ms, there is only one Bit. At
2ms, this Bit grows up, so immediately before
3ms, there is only one Nibble in Byteland.
