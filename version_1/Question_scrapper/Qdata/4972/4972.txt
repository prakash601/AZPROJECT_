Chef is very adventurous, so he asked Bob to give him a task.
Bob gave him a sequence of blocks with heights
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Chef is at the first block and he has to reach the
N-th block using the minimum number of moves to complete the task.
In one move, he can jump from the
i-th block to the
j-th block only if the following conditions are satisfied:
i<j
A
i
≥A
j
for all
k (
i<k<j),
A
k
≤A
j
You have to find the minimum number of moves Chef needs to perform to reach the last block, or determine that it is impossible.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A

,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the minimum number of moves or
−1 if it is impossible to reach the last block.

Explanation:
Example case 1: There is no way to move from the first block (with height
9) to any other block.
Example case 2: The only sequence of
4 moves is
20→17→15→8→7. For example, in the first move, all the heights between
20 and
17 do not exceed
17, so all conditions are satisfied.
