Consider an array
A consisting of
N positive elements. The frequency array of
A is the array
B of size
N such that
B
i
= frequency of element
A
i
in
A.
For example, if
A=[4,7,4,11,2,7,7], the frequency array
B=[2,3,2,1,1,3,3].
You have lost the array
A, but fortunately you have the array
B.
Your task is to construct the lexicographically smallest array
A such that:
1≤A
i
≤10
5
;
The frequency array of
A is equal to
B.
If no such array
A exists, print
−1.
Note: Array
X is lexicographically smaller than array
Y, if
X
i
<Y
i
, where
i is the first index where
X and
Y differ.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers -
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
, the frequency array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line,
N space separated integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, the lexicographically smallest array
A. If no such array
A exists, print
−1.
Constraints

The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
