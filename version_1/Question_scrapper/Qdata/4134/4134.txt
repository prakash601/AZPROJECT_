Alice likes all the numbers which are divisible by
A. Bob does not like the numbers which are divisible by
B and likes all the remaining numbers. Determine the smallest number greater than or equal to
N which is liked by both Alice and Bob. Output
−1 if no such number exists.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
A,
B and
N — the parameters mentioned in the problem statment.
Output Format
For each test case, output the smallest number
≥
N which is divisible by
A and is not divisible by
B. Output
−1 if no such number exists.
