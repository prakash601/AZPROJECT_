While performing complex market analysis William encountered the following problem:
For a given array
a
of size
n
and a natural number
e
, calculate the number of pairs of natural numbers
(i,k)
which satisfy the following conditions:
1≤i,k
i+e⋅k≤n
.
Product
ai⋅ai+e⋅ai+2⋅e⋅…⋅ai+k⋅e
is a prime number.
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤10000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
e
(1≤e≤n≤2⋅105)
, the number of items in the array and number
e
, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(1≤ai≤106)
, the contents of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case output the answer in the following format:
Output one line containing the number of pairs of numbers
(i,k)
which satisfy the conditions.

Note
In the first example test case two pairs satisfy the conditions:
i=2,k=1
, for which the product is:
a2⋅a5=2
which is a prime number.
i=3,k=1
, for which the product is:
a3⋅a6=19
which is a prime number.
In the second example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.
In the third example test case four pairs satisfy the conditions:
i=1,k=1
, for which the product is:
a1⋅a4=2
which is a prime number.
i=1,k=2
, for which the product is:
a1⋅a4⋅a7=2
which is a prime number.
i=3,k=1
, for which the product is:
a3⋅a6=2
which is a prime number.
i=6,k=1
, for which the product is:
a6⋅a9=2
which is a prime number.
In the fourth example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.
In the fifth example test case five pairs satisfy the conditions:
i=1,k=1
, for which the product is:
a1⋅a2=2
which is a prime number.
i=1,k=2
, for which the product is:
a1⋅a2⋅a3=2
which is a prime number.
i=1,k=3
, for which the product is:
a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4=2
which is a prime number.
i=2,k=1
, for which the product is:
a2⋅a3=2
which is a prime number.
i=2,k=2
, for which the product is:
a2⋅a3⋅a4=2
which is a prime number.
In the sixth example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.
