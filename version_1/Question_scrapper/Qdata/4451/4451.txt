Alice and Bob were playing a game yet again but this time, Bob already lost the game. Now he wants to take revenge.
Bob saw a jigsaw puzzle which was solved by Alice and decided to jumble the puzzle pieces again. There are
N puzzle pieces in a line numbered from
1 to
N in increasing order and he has
K minutes before Alice catches him.
Bob can swap any two pieces of the puzzle. Each swap takes
1 minute, and so Bob can make at most
K swaps.
Let
A
i
denote the piece in the
i-th position after Bob finishes making his swaps.
Alice's angriness is defined to be the number of pairs
(i,j) such that
1≤i<j≤N and
A
i
>A
j
.
Bob would like to make Alice as angry as possible, so he asks for your help: if he performs his swaps optimally, what is the maximum angriness he can achieve?
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K: the number of pieces and the number of swaps Bob can make.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer: Alice's maximum possible angriness.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
N=7, so the pieces are initially arranged as
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Bob can make
K=3 swaps. One optimal way of swapping is as follows:
First, swap
2 and
6. Now the pieces are
[1,6,3,4,5,2,7]
Next, swap
1 and
7. Now the pieces are
[7,6,3,4,5,2,1]
Finally, swap
3 and
5. Now the pieces are
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
The angriness of this sequence is
21, which is the maximum possible.
Test case
2:
N=1, so no swaps can be made. The answer is always
0.
