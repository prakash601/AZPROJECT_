You are given two matrices
A and
B, each with
R rows (numbered
1 through
R) and
C columns (numbered
1 through
C). Let's denote an element of
A or
B in row
i and column
j by
A
i,j
or
B
i,j
respectively.
You are also given an integer
X. You may perform the following operation on
A any number of times:
Choose an integer
v.
Choose
X consecutive elements of
A, either in the same row or in the same column.
Add
v to each of the chosen elements of
A.
Determine whether it is possible to change
A to
B in a finite number of operations.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
R,
C and
X.
R lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains
C space-separated integers
A
i,1
,A
i,2
,…,A
i,C
.
R more lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains
C space-separated integers
B
i,1
,B
i,2
,…,B
i,C
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if there is a sequence of operations that changes the matrix
A to
B, or "No" if such a sequence of operations does not exist.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We can add
−1 to both elements in row
1 and add
−1 to both elements in column
2.
Example case 2: After any operation, the sum of elements of
A remains even. However, the sum of elements of
B is odd, so
A cannot be changed to
B.
