Chef has a machine which he uses to rotate sequences. If he puts a sequence
S
1
,S
2
,…,S
N
into the machine, it produces the sequence
S
2
,S
3
,…,S
N
,S
1
, i.e. the first element of the sequence is moved to the end.
Chef is definitely not a newbie ― he knows about trivial things like finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence. Therefore, he now made a difficult problem to challenge himself:
You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. For each
k (
0≤k≤N−1), consider the sequence produced by inserting it into the machine repeatedly
k times (i.e. inserting
A into the machine and replacing
A by the sequence it produces,
k times); find the maximum sum of a non empty contiguous subsequence of this sequence.
However, to solve this problem, Chef needs the help of a pro. Solve it for him.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these integers should denote the largest sum of a non empty contiguous subsequence of the sequence produced by the machine after
i−1 repeated insertions.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
After zero insertions,
A=[−5,4,1,2]. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is
A=[4,1,2].
After one insertion,
A=[4,1,2,−5]. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is
A=[4,1,2].
After two insertions,
A=[1,2,−5,4]. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is
A=[4].
After three insertions,
A=[2,−5,4,1]. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is
A=[4,1].
