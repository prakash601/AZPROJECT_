Explanation:
Test Case
1: No matter which stone Chef removes, Chefina will remove the remaining stone from the same pile and make it empty.
Test Case
2: Since there is only
1 pile containing
10 stones, the game will last exactly
10 moves with last move made by Chefina.
Test Case
3: Chef can remove
1 stone from the first pile and thus make it empty.
