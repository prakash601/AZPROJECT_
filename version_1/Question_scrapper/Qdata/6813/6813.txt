Alice and Bob are playing a game. At the start of the game, there are
N piles of stones, the
i-th of which has
A
i
stones.
Alice and Bob alternate moves. On their move, a player does the following:
Choose one pile of stones, and discard the remaining
N−1 piles.
Partition the stones in the chosen pile into exactly
N new piles of stones, each containing at least
1 stone. Note that this means that the number of piles is always
N.
The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine the winner of the game if Alice moves first.
Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N, the number of piles.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

N
.
Output Format
For every test case print exactly one line containing the answer — either "Alice" or "Bob" (without the quotes). You can output Alice and Bob in any case (for example, the strings BOb, BOB, bob and boB will be recognized as a positive response)

Explanation:
In the first move, Alice can select the first pile and divide it into
3 piles of sizes
2,2, and
1. After this, Bob cannot make a move since each pile has less than
3 stones.
