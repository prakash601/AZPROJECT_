Dazzler has a task for you.
Given two positive integers
A and
B, find two positive integers
i and
j such that:
gcd
(i,j)>1;
A≤i<j≤B;
The value
(i+j) is minimum possible.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. If no such pair exists, print
−1.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers
A and
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line two space-separated integers
i and
j satisfying all the conditions. If no such pair exists, print
−1.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There exists no pair satisfying all the conditions.
Test case
2: A valid pair satisfying all the conditions is
(i,j)=(2,4). The value
gcd(2,4)=2>1. The value
(i+j)=6.
It can be proven that no such pair exists that satisfies all the conditions and has sum less than
6.
