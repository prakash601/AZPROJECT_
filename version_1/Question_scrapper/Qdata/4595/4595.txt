You are an administrator of a popular quiz website. Every day, you hold a quiz on the website.
There are
N users (numbered
1 through
N) and
M admins (numbered
N+1 through
N+M). For each quiz, each user is allowed to attempt it at most once. Sometimes, admins attempt the quizzes for testing purposes too; an admin may attempt a quiz any number of times.
On a certain day, the quiz was attempted
K times. For each
i (
1≤i≤K), the
i-th of these attempts was made by the person with number
L
i
. Find all the users who attempted the quiz more than once, in order to disqualify them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
K.
The second line contains
K space-separated integers
L

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing an integer
D denoting the number of users who should be disqualified, followed by a space and
D space-separated integers denoting their numbers in ascending order.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Since there is only a single attempt during the whole day, there cannot be any user who made more than one attempt.
Example case 2: User
1 attempted the quiz twice.
Example case 3: Users
2 and
5 attempted the quiz multiple times. The admin with number
10 also attempted the quiz multiple times, but admins are allowed to do that.
