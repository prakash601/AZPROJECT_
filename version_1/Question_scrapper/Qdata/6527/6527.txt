You are given a string
S of length
N consisting only of A's and B's. You will be given
Q queries each of which can be either of Type 1 or Type 2.
For a query of Type 1, you will be given two numbers
L and
R and a character
C. You are supposed to replace every character in
S from position
L to
R with
C.
For a query of Type 2, you will be given 4 numbers
L,
R,
p and
q. Now, for every character in
S from position
L to
R, perform the following operations in the order left to right:
If the character is "A", then replace
p with
(p−q+MOD)%MOD and
q with
(p+q)%MOD.
If the character is "B", then replace
p with
(p+q)%MOD and
q with
(q−p+MOD)%MOD.
is

+7.
Your task is to print the final values of
p and
q for each query of Type 2. ###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains multiple lines of input.
The first line of a testcase contains the integer
N
The second line containes the string
S
The third line contains the number of queries for that testcase,
Q
The next
Q lines contain the actual queries.
For Type 1 query, the input would be
1
L
R
C
For Type 2 query, the input would be
2
L
R
p
q
###Output: For each testcase, for each query of type 2, output in separate lines the value of
p followed by
q. ###Constraints
