It is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version
k=3
.
You are given a positive integer
n
. Find
k
positive integers
a1,a2,…,ak
, such that:
a1+a2+…+ak=n
LCM(a1,a2,…,ak)≤
n
2
Here
LCM
is the least common multiple of numbers
a1,a2,…,ak
.
We can show that for given constraints the answer always exists.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤104)
 — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
k
(
3≤n≤109
,
k=3
).
Output
For each test case print
k
positive integers
a1,a2,…,ak
, for which all conditions are satisfied.
