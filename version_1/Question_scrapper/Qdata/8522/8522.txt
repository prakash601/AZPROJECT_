You are given a binary string
s
of length
n
.
Let's define
di
as the number whose decimal representation is
sisi+1
(possibly, with a leading zero). We define
f(s)
to be the sum of all the valid
di
. In other words,
f(s)=
n−1
∑
i=1
di
.
For example, for the string
s=1011
:
d1=10
(ten);
d2=01
(one)
d3=11
(eleven);
f(s)=10+01+11=22
.
In one operation you can swap any two adjacent elements of the string. Find the minimum value of
f(s)
that can be achieved if at most
k
operations are allowed.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤105
). Description of the test cases follows.
First line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤105
,
0≤k≤109
) — the length of the string and the maximum number of operations allowed.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string
s
of length
n
, consisting of only zeros and ones.
It is also given that sum of
n
over all the test cases doesn't exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, print the minimum value of
f(s)
you can obtain with at most
k
operations.

Note
For the first example, you can't do any operation so the optimal string is
s
itself.
f(s)=f(1010)=10+01+10=21
.
For the second example, one of the optimal strings you can obtain is "0011000". The string has an
f
value of
22
.
For the third example, one of the optimal strings you can obtain is "00011". The string has an
f
value of
12
.
