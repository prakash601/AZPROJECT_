You are given a tree with
N vertices, rooted at vertex
1. The
i-th vertex of this tree has the integer
A
i
written on it.
For each vertex
u (
1≤u≤N), find the number of divisors of the product of all
A
v
such that
v lies in the subtree of
u.
Formally, for each
u:
Let
S
u
denote the set of vertices that lie in the subtree of
u (including
u).
Define
X
u
=∏
v∈S
u
A
v
Find the number of divisors of
X
u
The answer may be large, so report it modulo

Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the number of vertices.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the values written on the vertices.
The next
N−1 lines describe the edges of the tree. The
i-th of these
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers
u
i
and
v
i
, denoting an edge between vertices
u
i
and
v
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output one line containing
N space-separated integers. The
i-th of these integers is the answer for vertex
i.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The answers are as follows:
For
u=2,
X
u
=101 which is prime and so has two factors.
For
u=4,
X
u
=103 which is prime and so has two factors.
For
u=3,
X
u
=102 which has
8 factors, namely
{1,2,3,6,17,34,51,102}.
For
u=1,
X
u
=106110600, which has
192 factors.
