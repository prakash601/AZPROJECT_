“Animal instinct. When faced with danger, seek refuge in the herd.”
Jun-Ho has come to know about the escape passage route that VIPs use in case of emergency. Jun-Ho is in the leader's office and he is planning his escape from the building.
The building has a tree-like structure, with the leader's office as the root. Jun-Ho has obtained information on this structure, in the form of a tree on
N nodes rooted at
1. The building has some security, which can be calculated as follows:
Each node of the tree has a value assigned to it — say,
A
i
for node
i.
Let
u be a leaf node of the tree. The security of
u is defined to be the bitwise OR of all values on the (unique) path from the root to
u. Let this value be denoted
u
.
The security of the tree is then defined to be the sum of the security of all its leaf nodes, i.e, the sum of
L
u
across all leaf nodes
u of the tree.
The tree is considered to be secure when
L
u
>0 for every leaf node
u of the tree; otherwise it is said to be insecure.
Jun-Ho would like the security of the tree to be as low as possible when making his escape. To this end, he can perform the following operation zero or more times:
Pick a node
1≤u≤N of the tree, and set
A
u
=0.
However, if the tree ever becomes insecure as a result of an operation, the leader is immediately alerted and will foil Jun-Ho's plan. Thus, Jun-Ho cannot perform an operation that would make the tree insecure.
Help Jun-Ho find the minimum possible security the tree can have, such that the tree remains secure after every operation.
Note:
A leaf is a node of the tree without any child nodes.
For
N=1, the root is also considered to be a leaf.
Given input tree will be secured tree.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the number of nodes of the tree.
The next
N−1 lines each contain two space-separated integers
u and
v, denoting an edge between nodes
u and
v in the tree.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
— the values of the nodes.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the minimum security of the tree.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: No operation can be done, and the minimum security of the tree is thus
5.
Test Case 2: Set
A
1
and
A
3
to
0. It can be seen that
L
2
=2,
L
4
=1 and
L
5
=4; so every leaf has positive security. The security of the tree is
2+1+4=7, and this is the minimum attainable.
Test Case 3: The given tree already has minimum security, that being
6.
