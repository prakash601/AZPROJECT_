Ada is one of the best hairdressers in ChefLand. She invented a very cool hair style and named it "power tree".
A power tree with degree
l — let's denote it by
PT(l) — is a directed graph, which can be constructed recursively as follows:
PT(0) consists of a single node.
For
l>0:
Create one node
u — the root of power tree
PT(l).
Construct all power trees with smaller degrees, i.e.
PT(0),PT(1),…,PT(l−1).
For each of the tree created in the previous step, add a directed edge from
u to its root.
Today, Ada is going to cut the hair of some customers. Of course, all of them want to have a power tree hair style!
A customer's uncut hair is represented by a directed graph with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and exactly one edge between each pair of vertices. Ada should remove some edges (possibly none) from this graph in such a way that the resulting graph is a power tree. Note that she is not allowed to remove vertices!
Can you help Ada find the edges she should remove?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Each of the next
(
(
2
N
) lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v describing a directed edge from vertex
u to vertex
v. The edges are numbered
1 through
(
(
2
N
) in this order.
Output
For each test case:
If it is impossible to create a power tree, print a single line containing one integer
−1.
Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer
e denoting the number of edges to remove. The second line should contain
e space-separated integers denoting the numbers of the edges to remove.
If there are multiple answers, you may print any one.

Explanation:
Example case 1: Ada should remove edges
(1,4),
(2,4) and
(3,1). The resulting graph is a power tree with degree
l=2.
