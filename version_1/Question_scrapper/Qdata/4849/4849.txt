Chef has an array
A of length
N.
Since Chef's favorite number is
3, he wants to make all numbers in the array a multiple of
3.
Chef can do the following operation:
Select any
2 different indices
i and
j and increase
A
i
by
1 and decrease
A
j
by
1.
Help Chef find out the minimum number of operations required (or report its not possible) to achieve his objective.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains
N, denoting the length of the array.
The second line of each testcase contains
N space separated integers
A
i
.
Output Format
Output the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers divisible by
3.
If it is not possible to make every number divisible by
3, then output
−1.

Explanation:
Test Case
1: Chef can select the indices
2 and
1 and thus increase
A
2
by
1 and decrease
A
1
by
1. Thus the array becomes
[0,3,3]. So every number is now divisible by
3.
Test Case
2: Since all the numbers are already multiples of
3, Chef will not need to apply the operation at all.
Test Case
3: There is no way to make all the numbers a multiple of
3.
