You are given
n
elements numbered from
1
to
n
, the element
i
has value
ai
and color
ci
, initially,
ci=0
for all
i
.
The following operation can be applied:
Select three elements
i
,
j
and
k
(
1≤i<j<k≤n
), such that
ci
,
cj
and
ck
are all equal to
0
and
ai=ak
, then set
cj=1
.
Find the maximum value of
n
∑
i=1
ci
that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of elements.
The second line consists of
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
), where
ai
is the value of the
i
-th element.
Output
Print a single integer in a line — the maximum value of
n
∑
i=1
ci
that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.
