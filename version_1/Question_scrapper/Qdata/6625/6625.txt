"Out of 6 billion humans, the troublemakers are just a handful." - Dalai Lama
Nikitasha and Mansi are best friends. They have a binary sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
(each element of this sequence is
0 or
1). Their friend Sakshi always finds ways to trouble them. This time, Sakshi altered their sequence by performing the following operation
Z times:
Create a new sequence
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
. Initially,
A
i
=B
i
for each valid
i.
For each valid
i such that
A
i
=0 and
A
i+1
=1, swap
B
i
and
B
i+1
, i.e. set
B
i
=1 and
B
i+1
=0. Note that the order of swaps does not matter.
Replace the sequence
A by the sequence
B.
Now, Sakshi challenges Nikitasha And Mansi to find the altered sequence (the resulting sequence
A after
Z steps). Help Nikitasha and Mansi find this sequence.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Z.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers — the altered sequence.

Explanation:
Example case 1: After the first step, the sequence becomes
(1,0,1,1,0,1). After the second step, it becomes
(1,1,0,1,1,0).
Example case 2: After the first step, the sequence becomes
(1,0,1,0). After the second step, the sequence becomes
(1,1,0,0). Applying more steps does not alter the sequence anymore, so after the third and fourth step, the sequence remains
(1,1,0,0).
