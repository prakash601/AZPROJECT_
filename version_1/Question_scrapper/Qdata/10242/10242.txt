Given an array
a
of length
n
, find another array,
b
, of length
n
such that:
for each
i
(1≤i≤n)
MEX({b1
,
b2
,
…
,
bi})=ai
.
The
MEX
of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't belong to this set.
If such array doesn't exist, determine this.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1
,
a2
,
…
,
an
(
0≤ai≤i
) — the elements of the array
a
. It's guaranteed that
ai≤ai+1
for
1≤i<n
.
Output
If there's no such array, print a single line containing
−1
.
Otherwise, print a single line containing
n
integers
b1
,
b2
,
…
,
bn
(
0≤bi≤106
)
If there are multiple answers, print any.
