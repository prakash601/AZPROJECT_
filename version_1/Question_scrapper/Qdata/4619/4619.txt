Chef has two numbers
N and
M. He calls a pair of numbers
(A,B) good if it satisfies the following conditions:
1≤A,B≤M
gcd(A,B)≥N
Chef wants to find a good pair
(A,B) such that the value of
∣A−B∣ is maximized. Can you help Chef? (Here
∣X∣ represents the absolute value of
X).
If there are multiple good pairs for which the value of
∣A−B∣ is maximized, you can print any of them. It can be proved that under the given constraints, at least one good pair always exists.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
M — the parameters mentioned in the statment.
Output Format
For each test case, output two integers
A and
B such that
(A,B) is a good pair and the value of
∣A−B∣ is maximized.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1:
(5,5) and
(6,6) are the only good pairs and for both of them the value of
∣A−B∣ is
0.
Test case
2:
(6,8),(8,6),(2,8),(8,2),(4,6),(6,4),(2,6),(6,2),(2,4),(4,2) and
(2,2) are the good pairs out of which
∣A−B∣ is maximum for
(2,8) and
(8,2).
