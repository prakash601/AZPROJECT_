Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can make a move of type
2 and remove
1 stone each from all the piles.
Thus, Chefina has no valid move to make and she loses.
Test case
2: Consider the following sequence of moves:
Chef removes
1 stone each from all piles. Thus the remaining stones are
[0,1,2].
Chefina removes
1 stone from pile
2. Thus the remaining stones are
[0,0,2].
Chef removes
1 stone from pile
3. Thus the remaining stones are
[0,0,1].
Chefina removes
1 stone from pile
3. Thus the remaining stones are
[0,0,0].
Thus, Chef has no valid move to make and he loses.
