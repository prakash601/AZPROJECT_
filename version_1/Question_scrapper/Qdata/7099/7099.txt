Hulk has a set of distinct points
P in the 2D plane. His signature move is
Hulk
Smash. He performed
Hulk
Smash on the set
P which caused the points to change, and so he obtained a new set of points
P
′
.
More formally,
Hulk
Smash makes the new set
P
′
in the following way:
Initially, let
P
′
be empty.
For every
P
i
and
P
j
such that
1≤i<j≤N , add the mid point of
P
i
and
P
j
to the set
P
′
(only if it didn't exist in it already).
So,
P
′
is the set of midpoints of line segments connecting pairs of distinct points of
P. Note that points from
P do not necessarily have to be in
P
. See the samples below for a graphical example.
Find the number of points of
P
′
which lie on the convex hull of
P
′
. A point is said to lie on the convex hull if the shape of the convex hull is changed when this point is removed.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the size of
P.
The next
N lines contain two space-separated integers each, where the
i-th line contains
P
i
.x,P
i
.y denoting the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the
i-th point.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of points of
P
′
which lie on its convex hull.

Explanation:
In the below images, the set of points
P is denoted by the color pink, the set of points
P
′
is denoted by the color green. The blue point is the origin.
The below image represents the first test case
The below image represents the second test case
Note that by our definition, points
(1,4) and
(3,4) are not considered to lie on the convex hull of
P
′
, because removing one of them does not change the shape of the hull.
