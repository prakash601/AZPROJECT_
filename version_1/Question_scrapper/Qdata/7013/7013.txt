You have a Greenhouse of height
x units (i.e plants with height >
x cannot be kept inside it) and
n plants whose initial heights are
h
1
,h
2
…,h
n
. These plants are of a special kind: they grow by 1 unit if watered. You have to keep these plants in the greenhouse for at most
d days. On the
i’th day, you have to water exactly
a
i
different plants. You need to output the maximum number of days you can keep all the plants together inside the greenhouse (output
d if answer >
d). Of course, you shouldn't water a plant if it has reached the height of
x.
###Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases
T. For each test case:
The first line contains
x,
n and
d.
The next line contains
n integers denoting
h

.
The next line contains
d integers denoting
a

d
.
###Output: For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum number of days for which you can keep the plants in the greenhouse.
###Constraints
1≤T≤5

###Sample Input: 1 5 3 7 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 1 3
###Sample Output: 6
###Explanation: Here is a possible answer. These are the heights of plants in different days -
Day 0: 1 1 2
Day 1: 2 2 3
Day 2: 3 3 3
Day 3: 3 3 4
Day 4: 3 4 4
Day 5: 4 4 5
Day 6: 4 5 5
On the 7th day the heights will be 5 6 6 so you can’t keep all the plants together. You can check that no other way of watering the plants will do any better. Hence the output is 6.
