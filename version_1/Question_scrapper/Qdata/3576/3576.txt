Explanation:
Test case
1: The first style costs
10+20=30 rupees, and the second costs
9+25=34 rupees. The first is cheaper, so Chef will pay
30 rupees.
Test case
2: The first style costs
10+20=30 rupees, and the second costs
9+20=29 rupees. The second is cheaper, so Chef will pay
29 rupees.
Test case
3: The first style costs
10+20=30 rupees, and the second costs
20+10=30 rupees. Both styles cost the same, so Chef is always going to pay
30 rupees.
Test case
4: The first style costs
100+43=143 rupees, and the second costs
85+61=146 rupees. The first is cheaper, so Chef will pay
