A cubic lattice
L
in
3
-dimensional euclidean space is a set of points defined in the following way:
L={u⋅
→
r
1+v⋅
→
r
2+w⋅
→
r
3}u,v,w∈Z
Where
→
r
1,
→
r
2,
→
r
3∈Z3
are some integer vectors such that:
→
r
1
,
→
r

and
→
r
3
are pairwise orthogonal:

Where
→
a
⋅
→
b
is a dot product of vectors
→
a
and
→
b
.

You're given a set
A={
→
a
1,
→
a
2,…,
→
a
n}
of integer points,
i
-th point has coordinates
ai=(xi;yi;zi)
. Let
gi=gcd(xi,yi,zi)
. It is guaranteed that
gcd(g1,g2,…,gn)=1
.
You have to find a cubic lattice
L
such that
A⊂L
and
r
is the maximum possible.
Input
First line contains single integer
n
(
1≤n≤104
) — the number of points in
A
.
The
i
-th of the following
n
lines contains integers
xi
,
yi
,
zi
(
0<x
2
i
+y
2
i
+z
2
i
≤1016
) — coordinates of the
i
-th point.
It is guaranteed that
gcd(g1,g2,…,gn)=1
where
gi=gcd(xi,yi,zi)
.
Output
In first line output a single integer
r2
, the square of maximum possible
r
.
In following
3
lines output coordinates of vectors
→
r
1
,
→
r
2
and
→
r
3
respectively.
If there are multiple possible answers, output any.
