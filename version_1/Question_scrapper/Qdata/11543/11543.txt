Vasya wants to buy himself a nice new car. Unfortunately, he lacks some money. Currently he has exactly 0 burles.
However, the local bank has
n
credit offers. Each offer can be described with three numbers
ai
,
bi
and
ki
. Offers are numbered from
1
to
n
. If Vasya takes the
i
-th offer, then the bank gives him
ai
burles at the beginning of the month and then Vasya pays bank
bi
burles at the end of each month for the next
ki
months (including the month he activated the offer). Vasya can take the offers any order he wants.
Each month Vasya can take no more than one credit offer. Also each credit offer can not be used more than once. Several credits can be active at the same time. It implies that Vasya pays bank the sum of
bi
over all the
i
of active credits at the end of each month.
Vasya wants to buy a car in the middle of some month. He just takes all the money he currently has and buys the car of that exact price.

n
lines contains three integers

,
bi
and

(
1≤ai,bi,ki≤109
).
