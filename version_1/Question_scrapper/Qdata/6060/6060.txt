A complete bipartite graph or biclique is a special kind of bipartite graph. If we denote the two partitions of vertices of this graph by
A and
B, then such a biclique is denoted by
K
∣A∣,∣B∣
and satisfies the following conditions:
For each pair of vertices
a,b (
a∈A,
b∈B), there is an edge between vertices
a and
b.
For each pair of vertices
u,v∈A, there is no edge between these vertices.
For each pair of vertices
u,v∈B, there is no edge between these vertices either.
You are given a simple graph with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N) and
M edges. Note that this graph is not necessarily bipartite. You are also given an integer
k. Determine whether the graph contains the biclique
K
2,k
as a subgraph at least once, i.e. whether it is possible to obtain
K
2,k
by removing some (possibly zero) vertices, all edges adjacent to the removed vertices and some (possibly zero) more edges.
Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers
N,
M and
k.
Each of the following
M lines contains two space-separated integers
u and
v denoting that there is an edge between vertices
u and
v.
Output
Print a single line containing the string "YES" if the graph contains
K
2,k
or "NO" if it does not (without quotes).
Constraints
1≤N≤2,000
0≤M≤N(N−1)/2
1≤k≤10
1≤u,v≤N
the graph does not contain any self-loops or multiple edges
