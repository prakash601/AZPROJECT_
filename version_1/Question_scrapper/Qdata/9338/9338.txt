You are given an array
a
of
n
integers. Find the number of pairs
(i,j)
(
1≤i<j≤n
) where the sum of
ai+aj
is greater than or equal to
l
and less than or equal to
r
(that is,
l≤ai+aj≤r
).
For example, if
n=3
,
a=[5,1,2]
,
l=4
and
r=7
, then two pairs are suitable:
i=1
and
j=2
(
4≤5+1≤7
);
i=1
and
j=3
(
4≤5+2≤7
).
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n,l,r
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
,
1≤l≤r≤109
) — the length of the array and the limits on the sum in the pair.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
overall test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of index pairs
(i,j)
(
i<j
), such that
l≤ai+aj≤r
.
