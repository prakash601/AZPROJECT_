Alice has a positive integer
N. She is wondering how many ordered pairs of positive integers
(i,j) exist such that
i+j=N.
Help Alice figure out the answer.
Note that since the pairs are ordered,
(1,2) and
(2,1) are considered different.
Input Format
The first and only line of input contains a single integer
N.
Output Format
Print a single integer, the number of ordered pairs of positive integers
(i,j) such that
i+j=N.
Constraints
1≤N≤100
Sample 1:
Input
Output
1
0
Explanation:
As both integers must be positive, the minimum sum must be
1+1=2. Therefore there are no pairs of positive integers adding up to
1.
Sample 2:
Input
Output
2
1
Explanation:
(1,1) is the only pair whose sum is
2. Every other pair has a sum of at least
3.
Sample 3:
Input
Output
3
2
Explanation:
The two pairs are
(1,2) and
(2,1).
