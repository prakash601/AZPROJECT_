You are given two sequences
A

,…,A
N
and
C
1
,C
2
,…,C
N
. For each valid
i,
C
i
is the colour of
A
i
.
You should answer
Q queries. In each query:
You are given two colours
x and
y.
Consider the subsequence of
A which contains only elements
A
i
such that
C
i
=x or
C
i
=y (in the original order). Let's denote it by
B.
For each contiguous subsequence of
B (including empty subsequence), consider the sum of all its elements. Find the maximum of these sums.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

The third line contains
N space-separated integers
C

.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x and
y describing a query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of
B.
