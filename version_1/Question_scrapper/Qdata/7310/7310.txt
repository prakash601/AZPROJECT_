It's Valentine's Month, and so Chef wants to gift a string to Chefina. He knows that Chefina likes palindromic strings. Chef has a string
S consisting of digits from
0 to
9. He wants to convert this to a palindrome by performing zero or more operations, where an operation is defined as follows:
Pick any digit and replace all of its occurrences with any other digit.
For example, if
S=12123, in one move it can be turned into
14143 or
12128, but not
32123.
You are also given
N integers
cost
1
,cost
2
,…,cost
N
, where the cost of performing an operation that replaces
X characters is
cost
X
.
Your task is to help Chef minimize the cost of converting his string to a palindrome.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of
3 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, denoting the length of the string.
The second line of each test case contains a string of length
N, consisting of only the digits
0 to
9.
The third line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers, denoting the cost array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — the minimum cost to convert the string to a palindrome.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Replace all occurrences of
7 with
2 and then replace all occurrences of
2 with
5, making the final string
5555. The cost of doing this is
1+4=5.
Test case
2: The cost is
0 since the given string is already a palindrome.
Test case
3: We perform the following operations:
Replace
2 with
0 with a cost of
1.
Replace
0 with
3 with a cost of
3.
Replace
3 with
4 with a cost of
2.
Replace
4 with
7 with a cost of
1.
Therefore, the total cost is
1+3+2+1=7.
Test case
4: We can replace all occurrences of
1 with
2, incurring a total cost of
3.
In all the examples above, it can be shown that it is not possible to convert the string to a palindrome at a lower cost.
