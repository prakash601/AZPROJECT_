Dreamoon likes to play with sets, integers and . is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both a and b.
Let S be a set of exactly four distinct integers greater than 0. Define S to be of rank k if and only if for all pairs of distinct elements si, sj from S, .
Given k and n, Dreamoon wants to make up n sets of rank k using integers from 1 to m such that no integer is used in two different sets (of course you can leave some integers without use). Calculate the minimum m that makes it possible and print one possible solution.
Input
The single line of the input contains two space separated integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100).
Output
On the first line print a single integer — the minimal possible m.
On each of the next n lines print four space separated integers representing the i-th set.
Neither the order of the sets nor the order of integers within a set is important. If there are multiple possible solutions with minimal m, print any one of them.

Note
For the first example it's easy to see that set {1, 2, 3, 4} isn't a valid set of rank 1 since .
