You are given an array
A of length
N containing the elements
−1 and
1 only. Determine if it is possible to rearrange the array
A in such a way that
A
i
is not the geometric mean of
A
i−1
and
A
i+1
, for all
i such that
2≤i≤N−1.
Y is said to be the geometric mean of
X and
Z if
Y
2
=X⋅Z.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if it is possible to rearrange
A in such a way that
A
i
is not the geometric mean of
A
i−1
and
A
i+1
, where
2≤i≤N−1. Otherwise output No.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).

Yes
Explanation:
Test case 1: We can rearrange the array
A to
[1,1,−1,−1,1]. One can see that
A


=A

⋅A
i+1
, for any
2≤i≤N−1.
Test case 2: None of the rearrangements of
A satisy the given condition.
