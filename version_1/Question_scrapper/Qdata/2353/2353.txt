Given an array A[]  of n elements. Your task is to complete the Function num which returns an integer denoting the total number of times digit k appears in the whole array.
For Example:
Input:
A[] = {11,12,13,14,15}, k=1
Output:
6 
Explanation: Here digit 1 appears in the whole array 6 times.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function Num() which accepts an integer N and array A as input parameter and return the desired output.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
: O(1)
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=n<=20
1<=A[]<=1000
