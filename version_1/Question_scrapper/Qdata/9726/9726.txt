You are given five integers
n
,
dx1
,
dy1
,
dx2
and
dy2
. You have to select
n
distinct pairs of integers
(xi,yi)
in such a way that, for every possible pair of integers
(x,y)
, there exists exactly one triple of integers
(a,b,i)
meeting the following constraints:
{
x=xi+a⋅dx1+b⋅dx2,
y=yi+a⋅dy1+b⋅dy2.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The second line contains two integers
dx1
and
dy1
(
−106≤dx1,dy1≤106
).
The third line contains two integers
dx2
and
dy2
(
−106≤dx2,dy2≤106
).
Output
If it is impossible to correctly select
n
pairs of integers, print NO.
Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and then
n
lines, the
i
-th of which contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
−109≤xi,yi≤109
).
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
