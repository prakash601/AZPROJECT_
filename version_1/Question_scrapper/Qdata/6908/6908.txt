Alice and Bob are playing a game.
First, Alice throws
N darts at a board with dimensions
10
9
×10
9
at random. Each dart hits the board at a point (some of these points may coincide). Then, Bob should answer Alice's
Q questions. In each question, Alice chooses two integers
l and
r; Bob should only consider all points hit in throws
l through
r (inclusive) and compute the distance between the farthest pair of these points.
Help Bob find the answers to all queries.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
N denoting the number of points.
N lines follow. For each valid
i, the
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
denoting the coordinates of the point hit with the
i-th dart.
The next line contains a single integer
Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following
Q lines contains two space-separated integers
l and
r describing one query.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the square of the maximum distance. (It is guaranteed that this number is an integer.)
