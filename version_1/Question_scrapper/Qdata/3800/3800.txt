Chef has two integers
X and
Y. Chef wants to perform some operations to make
X and
Y equal. In one operation, Chef can either:
set
X:=X+1
or set
Y:=Y+2
Find the minimum number of operations required to make
X and
Y equal.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers
X and
Y.
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to make
X and
Y equal.

Explanation:
Let
(x,y) denote the values of
X and
Y respectively.
Test case
1: Only one operation is required:
(3,4)
X:=X+1
(4,4)
Test case
2: No operations are required since
X and
Y are already equal.
Test case
3: Two operations are required:
(7,3)
Y:=Y+2
(7,5)
Y:=Y+2
(7,7)
Test case
4: Three operations are required. One such sequence of operations is:
(5,2)
Y:=Y+2
(5,4)
X:=X+1
(6,4)
Y:=Y+2
(6,6)
