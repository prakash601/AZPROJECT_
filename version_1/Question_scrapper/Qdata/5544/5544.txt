Kulyash has given you a bag with
(N+M) balls having distinct colours. Among these,
N balls have the number
2 printed on them and
M balls have the number
0 printed on them.
He defines the score of a non-empty subset
S of these
(N+M) balls as:
(sum of the balls in
S)
−
(size of
S).
Find the count of non-empty subsets of these
(N+M) balls having their scores divisible by
3. Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number balls having
2 and the number of balls having
0 respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of non-empty subsets having scores divisible by
3, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The only non-empty subset having score divisible by
3 is
[2,0]. The score of this subset is
(2+0)−(2)=0, which is divisible by
3. So, the answer is
1.
Test case
2: There are
2 types of subsets having scores divisible by
3:
[2,0] and
[2,2,0,0]. The first type of subset can for formed in
4 ways (there are two
2s and two
0s) and the second type can be formed in only
1 way. So, the answer is
5.
