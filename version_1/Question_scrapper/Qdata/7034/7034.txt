You are given
2 integers
N and
M. You also have an empty set
S.
Consider an array
A of length
N such that
1≤A
i
≤M for each
1≤i≤N (there are
M
N
such arrays in total).
For each of these
M
N
arrays, insert all of its longest non-decreasing subsequences into
S.
Output the size of
S. Since the size of
S might be large, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Note that since
S is a set, it stores only distinct values. For example, when
N=3 and
M=2, the sequence
[1,1] is a longest non-decreasing subsequence for both
A=[1,2,1] and for
A=[2,1,1] — however, it will only be present once in
S.
Please look at the sample cases below for an explained example.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the size of set
S, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one possible array
[1,1,1], whose longest non-decreasing subsequence is also unique, namely
[1,1,1]. So, the size of set
S is
1.
Test case
2: There are
3
2
=9 possible arrays. These arrays and their corresponding sequences are as follows:
[1,1] contributes
[1,1] to
S
[1,2] contributes
[1,2] to
S
[1,3] contributes
[1,3] to
S
[2,1] contributes
[2] and
[1] to
S
[2,2] contributes
[2,2] to
S
[2,3] contributes
[2,3] to
S
[3,1] contributes
[3] and
[1] to
S
[3,2] contributes
[3] and
[2] to
S
[3,3] contributes
[3,3] to
S
Finally, it can be seen that
S={[1],[2],[3],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]} has a size of
9.
Test case
3: Set
S contains
5 elements, one corresponding to each of the
5 possible arrays.
