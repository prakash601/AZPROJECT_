Given a string S and an integer number N, print the output in the form: "The input string :S" and "The input integer :N" in the two separate lines.
Example 1:
Input:
S = 'GeeksforGeeks'
N = 20
Output : 
The input string :GeeksforGeeks
The input integer :20

Explanation:
On the first line we have to 
print "The input string :S" 
where S = 'GeeksforGeeks'.
On the second line, we have to 
print "The input integer :N"
Where N is 20.
Example 2:
Input:
S = 'Power'
N = 50

Output: 
The input string :Power
The input integer :50

Explanation:
On the first line, we have to
print "The input string :S"
where S = 'Power'.
On the second line, we have to
print "The input integer :N"
Where N is 50.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function printIntString() which takes the String S and an Integer N as input parameters and print two Strings on separate lines as mentioned above.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= |string length| <= 103
1 <= N <= 104
