Rockeater Rocky is on a mission to eat rocks!
There are
N rocks on the
X-axis. The
i
th
of these rocks is at position
X
i
and has weight
W
i
.
All the
W
i
are distinct.
Consider a subset
S consisting of
k rocks. Rocky will eat the rocks in
S as follows:
Let
i
1
,i
2
,…,i
k
be the list of indices of rocks in
S, sorted in ascending order of weight.
That is,
W
i
1
<W
i
2
<…<W
i
k
Rocky will eat the rocks in
S in ascending order of weight. That is, Rocky will start at position
X
i
1
and eat the rock there; then move to position
X
i
2
and eat the rock there, and so on till all the rocks in
S are eaten.
The distance traveled by Rocky is thus
∣X

∣+∣X

∣+…+∣X

In particular, if
∣S∣≤1 the distance traveled by Rocky is
0.
Rocky hasn't decided yet which subset of rocks to eat.
If every subset is equally likely to be chosen, find the expected value of the distance traveled by Rocky, modulo
10
9
+7.
More formally, under the constraints of the problem, it can be proved that the expected value can be represented as a rational number, i.e, an irreducible fraction
Q
P
. Further, there exists a unique integer
R such that
R×Q≡P(mod10

+7) and
0≤R<10

+7. Print this integer
R.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of rocks.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
X

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the expected distance traveled by Rocky, modulo

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are four possible subsets Rocky can choose. Three of them (
{},{1},{5}) require no travel, while in the fourth
({1,5}), Rocky has to travel a distance of
∣5−1∣=4.
The expected distance traveled is hence the average of
0+0+0+4, which is
1.
Test case
2: There are
8 possible subsets of rocks. Four of them have a travel distance of
0. For the rest:
{1,20} has a travel distance of
19.
{1,34} has a travel distance of
33.
{20,34} has a travel distance of
14.
{1,20,34} has a travel distance of
47, because Rocky moves
1→34→20 in ascending order of rock weights.
The answer is thus the average of
0+0+0+0+19+14+33+47=113, and
8
113
modulo
10
9
+7 is
125000015.
