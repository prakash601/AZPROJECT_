You are given three positive integers
N,x, and
y.
Count the number of arrays
P of length
N such that:
P
1
=P
N
=1
There are exactly
x indices
i such that
P
i
=1
There are exactly
y indices
i such that
P
i
=2
There are exactly
N−x−y indices
i such that
P
i
=3
P
i

=P
i+1
for each
1≤i<N
Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain three space-separated integers
N,x and
y.
Output Format
Output a single integer: the number of arrays obtained, modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Only two valid arrays are possible:
[1,2,1,3,1]
[1,3,1,2,1]
Test case
2: A couple of valid arrays are
[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1] and
[1,3,2,1,3,1,2,3,2,1]. It can be verified that there are
44 in total.
