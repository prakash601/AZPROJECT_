It is possible to prove that its value can be written as a fraction
b
a
, where
a and
b are positive integers and
b is coprime with
998,244,353. You need to find
a⋅b
−1
modulo
998,244,353, where
b
−1
denotes the multiplicative inverse of
b modulo
998,244,353.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer
N.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer
a⋅b
−1
modulo
998,244,353.
