A circular binary string is called good if it contains at least one character '1' and there is an integer
d such that for each character '1', the distance to the nearest character '1' clockwise is
d.
You are given a circular binary string
S with length
N. You may choose some characters in this string and flip them (i.e. change '1' to '0' or vice versa). Convert the given string into a good string by flipping the smallest possible number of characters.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains a single string
S with length
N.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of flips required to transform the initial string into a good string.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤5⋅10
5
S contains only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅10
