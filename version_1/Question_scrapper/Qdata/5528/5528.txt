Given an integer A that contains n > 1 digits. You are asked to remove exactly one digit to make the result number is divisible by 6, also make it biggest possible.
  Input
The first line contains an integer T, denotes the number of test cases. Each test case is described by an integer A in a single line.
Output
Each test case, output the answer on a single line (it's allowed to delete a digit such that the resulting number contains leading zeroes, you shouldn't remove them in this case). If it is impossible to make the result number satisfies the above condition, output -1.
  Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
A will not contain leading zeroes
the sum of n over all test cases ≤ 106
  Subtasks:
Subtask #1 (30 points): the sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2000
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constrains
