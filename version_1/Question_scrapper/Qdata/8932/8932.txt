Paprika loves permutations. She has an array
a1,a2,…,an
. She wants to make the array a permutation of integers
1
to
n
.
In order to achieve this goal, she can perform operations on the array. In each operation she can choose two integers
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and
x
(
x>0
), then perform
ai:=aimodx
(that is, replace
ai
by the remainder of
ai
divided by
x
). In different operations, the chosen
i
and
x
can be different.
Determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers
1
to
n
. If it is impossible, output
−1
.
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
. (
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers
1
to
n
, or
−1
if it is impossible.

Note
For the first test, the only possible sequence of operations which minimizes the number of operations is:
Choose
i=2
,
x=5
. Perform
a2:=a2mod5=2
.
For the second test, it is impossible to obtain a permutation of integers from
1
to
n
.
