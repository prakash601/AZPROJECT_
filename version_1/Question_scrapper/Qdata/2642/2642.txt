Given an array A[] of N integers and an index Key. Your task is to return the element present at index key in the array.
  Example 1:
Input:
5 2
10 20 30 40 50
Output:
30
  Example 2:
Input:
7 4


50
  Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findElementAtIndex() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer Key as inputs and returns the element present at index Key.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ Key ≤ N - 1
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100
