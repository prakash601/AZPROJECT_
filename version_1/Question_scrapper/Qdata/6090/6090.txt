Chef is given a binary string
S of length
N.
In one operation, Chef has to choose exactly
K indices and flip their values.
Chef can perform the above operation any number of times. Find the number of distinct binary strings Chef can obtain.
Since the answer might be large, output it module
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K, as mentioned in statement.
The next line contains the binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct binary strings Chef can obtain, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can flip
1 index in an operation. Thus, we can generate all possible binary strings of length
4. The total number of distinct strings that can be generated are
2
4
=16.
Test case
2: We have to flip
2 indices at once. Thus, we can convert
00 to
11. The only possible strings that can be generated are
00 and
11. Thus, the answer is
2.
