Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...
There are two arrays
a
and
b
of length
n
. Initially, an
ans
is equal to
0
and the following operation is defined:
Choose position
i
(
1≤i≤n
);
Add
ai
to
ans
;
If
bi≠−1
then add
ai
to
abi
.
What is the maximum
ans
you can get by performing the operation on each
i
(
1≤i≤n
) exactly once?
Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.
Input
The first line contains the integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of arrays
a
and
b
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−106≤ai≤106
).
The third line contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤n
or
bi=−1
).
Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any
i
(
1≤i≤n
) the sequence
bi,bbi,bbbi,…
is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with
−1
.
Output
In the first line, print the maximum
ans
you can get.
In the second line, print the order of operations:
n
different integers
p1,p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤n
). The
pi
is the position which should be chosen at the
i
-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.
