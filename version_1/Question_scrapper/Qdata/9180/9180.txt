There is a city that can be represented as a square grid with corner points in
(0,0)
and
(106,106)
.
The city has
n
vertical and
m
horizontal streets that goes across the whole city, i. e. the
i
-th vertical streets goes from
(xi,0)
to
(xi,106)
and the
j
-th horizontal street goes from
(0,yj)
to
(106,yj)
.
All streets are bidirectional. Borders of the city are streets as well.
There are
k
persons staying on the streets: the
p
-th person at point
(xp,yp)
(so either
xp
equal to some
xi
or
yp
equal to some
yj
, or both).
Let's say that a pair of persons form an inconvenient pair if the shortest path from one person to another going only by streets is strictly greater than the Manhattan distance between them.
Calculate the number of inconvenient pairs of persons (pairs
(x,y)
and
(y,x)
are the same pair).
Let's recall that Manhattan distance between points
(x1,y1)
and
(x2,y2)
is
|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
2≤n,m≤2⋅105
;
2≤k≤3⋅105
) — the number of vertical and horizontal streets and the number of persons.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
x1,x2,…,xn
(
0=x1<x2<⋯<xn−1<xn=106
) — the
x
-coordinates of vertical streets.
The third line contains
m
integers
y1,y2,…,ym
(
0=y1<y2<⋯<ym−1<ym=106
) — the
y
-coordinates of horizontal streets.
Next
k
lines contains description of people. The
p
-th line contains two integers
xp
and
yp
(
0≤xp,yp≤106
;
xp∈{x1,…,xn}
or
yp∈{y1,…,ym}
) — the coordinates of the
p
-th person. All points are distinct.
It guaranteed that sum of
n
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
, sum of
m
doesn't exceed
2⋅105
and sum of
k
doesn't exceed
3⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print the number of inconvenient pairs.

Note
The second test case is pictured below:
For example, points
3
and
4
form an inconvenient pair, since the shortest path between them (shown red and equal to
7
) is greater than its Manhattan distance (equal to
5
).
Points
3
and
5
also form an inconvenient pair: the shortest path equal to
1000001
(shown green) is greater than the Manhattan distance equal to
999999
.
But points
5
and
9
don't form an inconvenient pair, since the shortest path (shown purple) is equal to its Manhattan distance.
