There is a square grid of size
n×n
. Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs
min(h,w)
to color a rectangle of size
h×w
. You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.
The square is large, so we give it to you in a compressed way. The set of black cells is the union of
m
rectangles.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤109
,
0≤m≤50
) — the size of the square grid and the number of black rectangles.
Each of the next
m
lines contains 4 integers
xi1
yi1
xi2
yi2
(
1≤xi1≤xi2≤n
,
1≤yi1≤yi2≤n
) — the coordinates of the bottom-left and the top-right corner cells of the
i
-th black rectangle.
The rectangles may intersect.
Output
Print a single integer — the minimum total cost of painting the whole square in white.
