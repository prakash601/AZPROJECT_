You are given an
8×8 chessboard. Your enemy king is at point
(X,Y)
(1≤X,Y≤8).
You need to place some number of queen pieces on the chessboard such that the following conditions are satisfied:
The king should not be under attack by any of the queens that you have placed.
The king should not be able to make any move.
Note that a king can move one unit in any of the
8 direction while a queen can attack horizontally, vertically as well as diagonally.
Find the minimum number of queens required to satisfy the given conditions. Print the chessboard where
0 denotes empty cells,
1 denotes the king, and
2 denotes the queen(s) placed by you in some position(s).
In case of multiple answers, print any.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
A and
B — the coordinates of the king.
Output Format
For each test case, output a
8×8 grid consisting of King, Queen(s) and blank cells.
Print the chessboard in
8 lines where each line has
8 space-separated integers where
0 denotes empty cells,
1 denotes the king, and
2 denotes the queen(s) placed by you in some position(s).

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can place
2 queens at
(1,3) and
(3,3) respectively. Thus, the king at
(2,1) has no safe squares to go to and is not under attack.
