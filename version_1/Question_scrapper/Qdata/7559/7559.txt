You are given a tree of
N vertices. Vertex
i has the color
A
i
associated to it.
Initially, the root of the tree is vertex
1.
Process
Q queries on this tree, each being one of the following three types:
1 u c: for every vertex
x such that
x lies in the subtree of
u, set
A
x
to
c
2 u: change the root of the tree to
u
3 u c: count the number of vertices in the subtree of
u that have color
c
Note that in the first and third types of queries, 'subtree' is with respect to whichever the current root happens to be: see the sample tests below for an example.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N — the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the initial colors of the vertices.
Each of the next
N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers:
u and
v, denoting an edge between vertices
u and
v in the tree.
The next line contains a single integer
Q, the number of queries that you have to process.
The next
Q lines contain the queries, in the format mentioned above in the statement.
Output Format
Print the answer to each query of type
3 on a new line.

Explanation:
The queries proceed as follows:
Query
1: the number of vertices in the subtree of
2 with color
1.
The current root is
1, so the subtree of
2 consists of
{2,3,4,6}. Among these,
3 and
4 have color
1, so the answer is
2.
Query
2: set everything in the subtree of
4 to have color
2.
The current subtree of
4 is
{4,6}. So, the color array is now
[1,2,1,2,3,2].
Query
3: the number of vertices in the subtree of
2 with color
2.
2,4,6 have color
2 so the answer is
3.
Query
4: set the root to
6.
Query
5: the number of vertices in the subtree of
2 with color
2.
The current root is
6, so the subtree of
2 consists of
{1,2,3,5}. Among these, only
2 has color
2, so the answer is
1.
Query
6: set everything in the subtree of
1 to have color
4.
The current subtree of
1 is
{1,5}. So, the color array is now
[4,2,1,2,4,2].
Query
7: the number of vertices in the subtree of
2 with color
1.
Only
3 has color
1 so the answer is
1.
