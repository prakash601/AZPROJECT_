Given N, count all ‘a’(>=1) and ‘b’(>=0) that satisfy the condition a3 + b3 = N.
  Example 1:
Input:
N = 9 
Output:
2
Explanation:
There are two solutions: (a=1, b=2)
and (a=2, b=1).

Example 2:
Input:


1
Explanation:
Thereis only one solution: (a=3, b=0)
  Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pairCubeCount() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.
  Expected Time Complexity: O(cbrt(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
  Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
