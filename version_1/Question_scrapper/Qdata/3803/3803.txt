In a class of
N students, a class test was held. The
i
th
student scored
A
i
marks. It is also known that the scores of all students were distinct.
A student passes the test if their score is strictly greater than the passing mark. Given that exactly
X students pass in the test, find the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X — the number of students in the class and the number of students that passed in the test.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, where the
i
th
integer denotes the marks of the
i
th
student.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Since both students pass the test, both students scored greater than passing marks. The maximum value of passing marks can be
0, as both students have marks greater than
0.
Test case
2: Only one student passes the test. Thus, the third student has passed the test by scoring
7 marks. The passing marks of the test is
6.
Test case
3: Since three students pass the test, students
2,3, and
4 scored greater than passing marks. The maximum value of passing marks can be
30, three students have marks greater than
30.
