There is a trampoline park with
n
trampolines in a line. The
i
-th of which has strength
Si
.
Pekora can jump on trampolines in multiple passes. She starts the pass by jumping on any trampoline of her choice.
If at the moment Pekora jumps on trampoline
i
, the trampoline will launch her to position
i+Si
, and
Si
will become equal to
max(Si−1,1)
. In other words,
Si
will decrease by
1
, except of the case
Si=1
, when
Si
will remain equal to
1
.
If there is no trampoline in position
i+Si
, then this pass is over. Otherwise, Pekora will continue the pass by jumping from the trampoline at position
i+Si
by the same rule as above.
Pekora can't stop jumping during the pass until she lands at the position larger than
n
(in which there is no trampoline). Poor Pekora!
Pekora is a naughty rabbit and wants to ruin the trampoline park by reducing all
Si
to
1
. What is the minimum number of passes she needs to reduce all
Si
to
1
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
) — the number of trampolines.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
S1,S2,…,Sn
(
1≤Si≤109
), where
Si
is the strength of the
i
-th trampoline.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
5000
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of passes Pekora needs to do to reduce all
Si
to
1
.

Note
For the first test case, here is an optimal series of passes Pekora can take. (The bolded numbers are the positions that Pekora jumps into during these passes.)
[1,4,2,2,2,2,2]
[1,4,1,2,1,2,1]
[1,3,1,2,1,1,1]
[1,2,1,2,1,1,1]
For the second test case, the optimal series of passes is show below.
[2,3]
[1,3]
[1,2]
For the third test case, all
Si
are already equal to
1
.
