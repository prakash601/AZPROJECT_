A binary string is a string where every character is
0
or
1
. Call a binary string decent if it has an equal number of
0
s and
1
s.
Initially, you have an infinite binary string
t
whose characters are all
0
s. You are given a sequence
a
of
n
updates, where
ai
indicates that the character at index
ai
will be flipped (
0↔1
). You need to keep and modify after each update a set
S
of disjoint ranges such that:
for each range
[l,r]
, the substring
tl…tr
is a decent binary string, and
for all indices
i
such that
ti=1
, there exists
[l,r]
in
S
such that
l≤i≤r
.
You only need to output the ranges that are added to or removed from
S
after each update. You can only add or remove ranges from
S
at most
106
times.
More formally, let
Si
be the set of ranges after the
i
-th update, where
S0=∅
(the empty set). Define
Xi
to be the set of ranges removed after update
i
, and
Yi
to be the set of ranges added after update
i
. Then for
1≤i≤n
,
Si=(Si−1∖Xi)∪Yi
. The following should hold for all
1≤i≤n
:
∀a,b∈Si,(a≠b)→(a∩b=∅)
;
Xi⊆Si−1
;
(Si−1∖Xi)∩Yi=∅
;
n
∑
i=1
(|Xi|+|Yi|)≤106
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of updates.
The next
n
lines each contain a single integer
ai
(
1≤ai≤2⋅105
) — the index of the
i
-th update to the string.
Output
After the
i
-th update, first output a single integer
xi
— the number of ranges to be removed from
S
after update
i
.
In the following
xi
lines, output two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l<r≤106
), which denotes that the range
[l,r]
should be removed from
S
. Each of these ranges should be distinct and be part of
S
.
In the next line, output a single integer
yi
— the number of ranges to be added to
S
after update
i
.
In the following
yi
lines, output two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l<r≤106
), which denotes that the range
[l,r]
should be added to
S
. Each of these ranges should be distinct and not be part of
S
.
The total number of removals and additions across all updates must not exceed
106
.
After processing the removals and additions for each update, all the ranges in
S
should be disjoint and cover all ones.
It can be proven that an answer always exists under these constraints.

Note
Line breaks are provided in the sample only for the sake of clarity, and you don't need to print them in your output.
After the first update, the set of indices where
ai=1
is
{1}
. The interval
[1,2]
is added, so
S1={[1,2]}
, which has one
0
and one
1
.
After the second update, the set of indices where
ai=1
is
{1,6}
. The interval
[5,6]
is added, so
S2={[1,2],[5,6]}
, each of which has one
0
and one
1
.
After the third update, the set of indices where
ai=1
is
{1,5,6}
. The interval
[5,6]
is removed and the intervals
[4,5]
and
[6,7]
are added, so
S3={[1,2],[4,5],[6,7]}
, each of which has one
0
and one
1
.
After the fourth update, the set of indices where
ai=1
is
{1,6}
. The interval
[4,5]
is removed, so
S4={[1,2],[6,7]}
, each of which has one
0
and one
1
.
After the fifth update, the set of indices where
ai=1
is
{1}
. The interval
[6,7]
is removed, so
S5={[1,2]}
, which has one
0
and one
1
.
