There is a binary string
t
of length
10100
, and initally all of its bits are
0
. You are given a binary string
s
, and perform the following operation some times:
Select some substring of
t
, and replace it with its XOR with
s
.
†
After several operations, the string
t
has exactly two bits
1
; that is, there are exactly two distinct indices
p
and
q
such that the
p
-th and
q
-th bits of
t
are
1
, and the rest of the bits are
0
.
Find the lexicographically largest
‡
string
t
satisfying these constraints, or report that no such string exists.
†
Formally, choose an index
i
such that
0≤i≤10100−|s|
. For all
1≤j≤|s|
, if
sj=1
, then toggle
ti+j
. That is, if
ti+j=0
, set
ti+j=1
. Otherwise if
ti+j=1
, set
ti+j=0
.
‡
A binary string
a
is lexicographically larger than a binary string
b
of the same length if in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a bit
1
and the corresponding bit in
b
is
0
.
Input
The only line of each test contains a single binary string
s
(
1≤|s|≤35
).
Output
If no string
t
exists as described in the statement, output -1. Otherwise, output the integers
p
and
q
(
1≤p<q≤10100
) such that the
p
-th and
q
-th bits of the lexicographically maximal
t
are
1
.

Note
In the first test, you can perform the following operations.
00000…→10000…→11000…
In the second test, you can perform the following operations.
00000…→00100…→00110…
In the third test, you can perform the following operations.
00000…→11110…→10001…
It can be proven that these strings
t
are the lexicographically largest ones.
In the fourth test, you can't make a single bit
1
, so it is impossible.
