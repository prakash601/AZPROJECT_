Let's define a function
P(x,y)=(x−y)
2
. For given real numbers
a and
b, let's define a polynomial
Q
a,b
(x)=P(P(P(x,a),a−b),x−b).
Next, let's define a function
F(a,b):
If
Q
a,b
(x) has no real roots,
F(a,b)=0.
Otherwise, let
r be the largest real root of
Q
a,b
(x).
If
r is rational, it can be represented by a fraction
r=
q
p
, where
p and
q are coprime integers and
q>0. Then,
F(a,b)=p+q.
If
r is irrational, it can be proved that in this case, it can be represented in the form
r=
q
p+
z
, where
p,
q and
z are integers,
q>0 and
z>0. Choose the representation with the smallest value of
q (it is guaranteed to be unique in this case). Then,
F(a,b)=p+z+q.

Explanation
Example case 1:
Q
0,0
(x)=x
4
−x, so the largest real root is
r=
1
1
,
F(0,0)=1+1=2 and the answer is
2.
Example case 2:
Q
0,0
(x) has
r=2, so
F(0,0)=1+1=2
Q
0,3
(x) has no real roots, so
F(0,3)=0
Q
3,0
(x) has
r=
2
7+
13
, so
F(3,0)=7+13+2=22
Q
3,3
(x) has
r=4, so
F(3,3)=4+1=5
The answer is
2+0+22+5=29.
