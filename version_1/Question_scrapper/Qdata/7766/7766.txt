You're given a positive integer
n
.
Find a permutation
a1,a2,…,an
such that for any
1≤l<r≤n
, the sum
al+al+1+⋯+ar
is not divisible by
r−l+1
.
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contain a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the size of the desired permutation.
Output
For each test case, if there is no such permutation print
−1
.
Otherwise, print
n
distinct integers
p1,p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤n
) — a permutation satisfying the condition described in the statement.
If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note
In the first example, there are no valid pairs of
l<r
, meaning that the condition is true for all such pairs.
In the second example, the only valid pair is
l=1
and
r=2
, for which
a1+a2=1+2=3
is not divisible by
r−l+1=2
.
in the third example, for
l=1
and
r=3
the sum
a1+a2+a3
is always
6
, which is divisible by
3
.
