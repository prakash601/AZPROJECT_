You are given a vector V of size n. You need to sort it and reverse it.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 5
V = 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided functions sortVector() and reverseVector(). Return the vector after performing suitable operations.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 107
0 <= Vi <= 107
