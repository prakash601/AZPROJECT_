You are given an array
A of
N integers.
Find the maximum sum of two distinct integers in the array.
Note: It is guaranteed that there exist at least two distinct integers in the array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains single integer
N — the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers, denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum sum of two distinct integers in the array.
