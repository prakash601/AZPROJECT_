You are given three distinct integers
A,B, and
C.
Find any integer
X (0≤X<2
30
) such that:
(A⊕X)<(B⊕X)<(C⊕X), where
⊕ denotes the Bitwise XOR operation.
If no such
X exists, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T, the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
A,B, and
C.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer on a new line, the value of
X that satisfies the above conditions or
−1 if no such
X exists.
If multiple such
X satisfy the condition, you may print any.

Explanation:
Test case
1: For
X=4,
A⊕X=1⊕4 =5
B⊕X=2⊕4 =6
C⊕X=3⊕4 =7
Thus,
(A⊕X)<(B⊕X)<(C⊕X).
Test case
2: No
X (0≤X<2
30
) exists that satisfies the above conditions.
Test case
3: For
X=3,
A⊕X=3⊕3 =0
B⊕X=2⊕3 =1
C⊕X=1⊕3 =2
Thus,
(A⊕X)<(B⊕X)<(C⊕X).
