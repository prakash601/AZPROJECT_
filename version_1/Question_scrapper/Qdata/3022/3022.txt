Given N number of square blocks. The height of each square block is 1. The task is to create a  staircase of max height using these blocks.
Note: The first stair would require only one block, the second stair would require two blocks and so on.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 10
Output:
4
Explanation:
The max height of the stairs with
10 blocks is 4.
Example 2:
Input:

Output:
5
Explanation:
The max height of the stairs with
16 blocks is 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxStairHeight() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
