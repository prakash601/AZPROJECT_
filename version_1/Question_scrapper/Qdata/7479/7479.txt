Tsetso likes to play with arrays.
An Array
A[1,2,…,N] is said to be a Tsetso array if
A[1]⋅A[N]=max(A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N−1
,A
N
).
Bedo, his teammate, likes to solve problems so much, so Tsetso gave him an array
A of
N
distinct integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and
Q queries of the form
[L,R] and asked him to count the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range.
A subarray
[L,R] is to be a Tsetso subarray if
A[L]⋅A[R]=max(A
L
,A
L+1
,....,A
R−1
,A
R
).
Bedo spent a lot of time trying to solve it, but he couldn't, can you?
: A sequence
a is a subarray of a sequence
b if
a can be obtained from
b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Input Format
First-line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q, the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries.
The second line contains
N
distinct space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Then
Q lines follow each line containing two space-separated integers
L,R.
Output Format
For each query, output in a single line the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range
[L,R].

Explanation:
All the valid subarrays are
[1,6],[2,4],[3,5],[4,5],[5,5],[5,6],[4,7].
One of the invalid subarrays is
[1,3],3⋅24
