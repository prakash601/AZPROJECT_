A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points except in the case when both players have 10 points each, then the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. Could you please help the Chef find out who the winner was from the given statistics? (It is guaranteed that statistics represent always a valid, finished match.)

Explanation:
Example case 1. Chef won the match 11:2, his opponent won just two points, the first and the third of the match.
Example case 2. Chef lost this match 11:3, however he started very well the match, he won the first three points in a row, but maybe he got tired and after that lost 11 points in a row.
