After learning about the bitwise AND operation, Ridbit challenged Ashishgup to solve the following problem.
Let's denote the bitwise AND of one or more integers
a
1
,a
2
,…,a
k
by
AND(a
1
,a
2
,…,a
k
). For example,
AND(7,3,5)=1. In particular, for an integer
x,
AND(x)=x.
Given a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, Ridbit wants Ashishgup to reorder its elements (possibly leaving the sequence unchanged) in such a way that in the resulting sequence
A, the sum of the values of bitwise AND for all prefixes of the sequence, i.e.
∑
N
AND(A
,A
,…A
), is maximum possible.
Find the maximum value of this sum.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible value of the sum of values of bitwise AND for all prefixes.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The optimal order is
[2,1,0]. Then,
AND(2)+AND(2,1)+AND(2,1,0)=2+0+0=2.
Example case 2: The optimal order is
[3,1,1,2]. Then,
AND(3)+AND(3,1)+AND(3,1,1)+AND(3,1,1,2)=3+1+1+0=5.
