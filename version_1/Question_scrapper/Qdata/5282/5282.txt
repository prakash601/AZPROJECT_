Kulyash has given you an array
A of size
N.
He defines the subsequence-number of a non-empty subsequence
S of array
A as the number formed by the concatenation of all the elements of the subsequence
S.
Find the count of non-empty subsequences of
A having their subsequence-numbers divisible by
7. Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
For example: Consider
A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. A subsequence
S of
A is
[2,5,7,10]. The subsequence-number of this subsequence is
25710.
Input Format
The first line will contain
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N, the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the number of subsequences with subsequence-number divisible by
7 modulo
1000000007.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Only
3 subsequences are possible for the given array. These are
[1],
[1,2], and
[2]. The subsequence-numbers are
1,
12, and
2 respectively. None of the subsequence-numbers are divisible by
7, so the answer is
0.
Test case
2:
[1,4] is the only subsequence having its subsequence-number
14 which is divisible by
7. So, the answer is
1.
Test case
3: All the non-empty subsequences
[7],
[7], and
[7,7] have their subsequence-numbers
7,7, and
77 divisible by
7. So, the answer is
3.
