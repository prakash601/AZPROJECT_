Sereja asks you to find out number of arrays A of size N, i.e. A1, A2, ..., AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ M), such that for each pair i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N) gcd(Ai, Aj) = 1.
As the answer could be large, print it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007).
Input
First line of the input contain an integer T - number of test cases.
T tests follow. First line of each test case contain two space separated integers N, M.
Output
For each test case output required answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ M ≤ 100
Subtasks
Subtask #1: (10 points, TL = 5 secs) 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10
Subtask #2: (25 points, TL = 5 secs) 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
Subtask #3: (65 points, TL = 5 secs) original
