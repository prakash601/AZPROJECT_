Chef has invited Alice for his birthday party. Now, Alice is thinking about what to give Chef as a present. She should obviously choose a sequence ― what could possibly be a better birthday gift than a sequence!
After some thinking, Alice chose a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. However, she does not want to simply give this sequence to Chef. Instead, she decided to give Chef a sequence
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
, where
B
i
=⋁
j=1
i
A
j
for each valid
i and
⋁ denotes the bitwise OR operation. Chef can try to generate a sequence
A from
B, but there could be more than one such possible sequence.
Now, Alice is wondering how many sequences
A correspond to the given sequence
B. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo
10
9
+7. Note that it is not guaranteed that the given sequence
B was generated from some sequence
A.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible sequences
A modulo
10
9
+7.
