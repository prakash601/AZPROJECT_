For an array of integers
[a1,a2,…,an]
, let's call the value
|a1−a2|+|a2−a3|+⋯+|an−1−an|
the contrast of the array. Note that the contrast of an array of size
1
is equal to
0
.
You are given an array of integers
a
. Your task is to build an array of
b
in such a way that all the following conditions are met:
b
is not empty, i.e there is at least one element;
b
is a subsequence of
a
, i.e
b
can be produced by deleting some elements from
a
(maybe zero);
the contrast of
b
is equal to the contrast of
a
.
What is the minimum possible size of the array
b
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅105
) — the size of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,⋅,an
(
0≤ai≤109
) — elements of the array itself.
The sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
3⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible size of the array
b
.
