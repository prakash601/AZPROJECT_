Toad Mikhail has an array of
2k
integers
a1,a2,…,a2k
.
Find two permutations
p
and
q
of integers
0,1,…,2k−1
, such that
ai
is equal to
pi⊕qi
for all possible
i
, or determine there are no such permutations. Here
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input
The first line contains one integer
k
(
2≤k≤12
), denoting that the size of the array is
2k
.
The next line contains
2k
space-separated integers
a1,a2,…,a2k
(
0≤ai<2k
) — the elements of the given array.
Output
If the given array can't be represented as element-wise XOR of two permutations of integers
0,1,…,2k−1
, print "Fou".
Otherwise, print "Shi" in the first line.
The next two lines should contain the description of two suitable permutations. The first of these lines should contain
2k
space-separated distinct integers
p1,p2,…,p2k
, and the second line should contain
2k
space-separated distinct integers
q1,q2,…,q2k
.
All elements of
p
and
q
should be between
0
and
2k−1
, inclusive;
pi⊕qi
should be equal to
ai
for all
i
such that
1≤i≤2k
. If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.
