Chef's last task in his internship requires him to construct
2 permutations, each having length
N, such that the bitwise AND of each pair of elements at every index is the same.
Formally, if the permutations are
A and
B, then, the value
A
i
&B
i
must be constant over all
1≤i≤N.
Help Chef by providing him
2 such permutations. If it is not possible to construct such permutations, print
−1 instead.
A permutation is a sequence of integers from
1 to
N of length
N containing each number exactly once.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, a single integer
N denoting the size of the required permutations.
Output Format
If there are valid permutations that satisfy the required condition, then:
In the first line, output
N space-separated integers denoting the permutation
A.
In the second line, output
N space-separated integers denoting the permutation
B.
If there is no valid pair of permutations, print -1 in a single line.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤10

Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: There is only one element in each array and the resultant bitwise AND is
1. Thus,
A=[1] and
B=[1].
Test case
2: Let
A=[1,2] and
B=[2,1]. The resultant bitwise AND of each pair at any index is equal to
0. So, this is a valid pair of permutations.
Test case
3: There are
6 permutations of length
3. It can be seen that any pair of the
6 permutations does not satisfy the stated condition.
