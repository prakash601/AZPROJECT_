You are given an undirected graph without self-loops or multiple edges which consists of
n
vertices and
m
edges. Also you are given three integers
n1
,
n2
and
n3
.
Can you label each vertex with one of three numbers 1, 2 or 3 in such way, that:
Each vertex should be labeled by exactly one number 1, 2 or 3;
The total number of vertices with label 1 should be equal to
n1
;
The total number of vertices with label 2 should be equal to
n2
;
The total number of vertices with label 3 should be equal to
n3
;
|colu−colv|=1
for each edge
(u,v)
, where
colx
is the label of vertex 
x
.
If there are multiple valid labelings, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤5000
;
0≤m≤105
) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
The second line contains three integers
n1
,
n2
and
n3
(
0≤n1,n2,n3≤n
) — the number of labels 1, 2 and 3, respectively. It's guaranteed that
n1+n2+n3=n
.
Next
m
lines contan description of edges: the
i
-th line contains two integers
ui
,
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
;
ui≠vi
) — the vertices the
i
-th edge connects. It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops or multiple edges.
Output
If valid labeling exists then print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print string of length
n
consisting of 1, 2 and 3. The
i
-th letter should be equal to the label of the
i
-th vertex.
If there is no valid labeling, print "NO" (without quotes).
