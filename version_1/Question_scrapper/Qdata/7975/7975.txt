You are given a set
a1,a2,…,an
of distinct positive integers.
We define the squareness of an integer
x
as the number of perfect squares among the numbers
a1+x,a2+x,…,an+x
.
Find the maximum squareness among all integers
x
between
0
and
1018
, inclusive.
Perfect squares are integers of the form
t2
, where
t
is a non-negative integer. The smallest perfect squares are
0,1,4,9,16,…
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤50
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
 (
1≤n≤50
) — the size of the set.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
a1,a2,…,an
in increasing order (
1≤a1<a2<…<an≤109
) — the set itself.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
50
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the largest possible number of perfect squares among
a1+x,a2+x,…,an+x
, for some
0≤x≤1018
.

Note
In the first test case, for
x=0
the set contains two perfect squares:
1
and
4
. It is impossible to obtain more than two perfect squares.
In the second test case, for
x=3
the set looks like
4,9,16,25,100
, that is, all its elements are perfect squares.
