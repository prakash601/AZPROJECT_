Once upon a time, in a land far, far away... nevermind, we don't recall the rest of the story.
All we know is that Chef has a matrix of integers
M with
N rows and
N columns; he wants to take a single element from each row and a single element from each column (
N elements in total) and find their bitwise XOR. Find the set of all values he could obtain.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
N lines follow. For each
i (
1≤i≤N), the
i-th of the following lines contains
N space-separated integers
M
i,1
,M
i,2
,…,M
i,N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one or more space-separated integers in increasing order — the obtainable values.

Explanation:
Example case 1: We could choose
M
1,1
=5 and
M
2,2
=7; since we are only allowed to choose one element from each row and one from each column, we cannot choose anything else from rows 1, 2 and columns 1, 2, so we have to choose
M
3,3
=0. Their XOR is
5⊕7⊕0=2.
Another combination could be
M
1,3
=15,
M
2,1
=19 and
M
3,2
=0. Their XOR is
15⊕19⊕0=28.
