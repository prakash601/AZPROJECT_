You are given an integer sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
and integers
K and
M. For
1≤i≤j≤N, let's define
S(i,j) as the number of ways to choose exactly
K elements of the contiguous subsequence
A
i
,A
i+1
,…,A
j
in such a way that the median of these
K elements is
≥M.
Find the sum of
S(i,j) over all
i,j such that
1≤i≤j≤N. Since this sum may be large, calculate it modulo
10

+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers
N,
K and
.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
