Chef gave you an infinite number of candies to sell. There are
N customers, and the budget of the
i
th
customer is
A
i
rupees, where
1≤A
i
≤M.
You have to choose a price
P, to sell the candies, where
1≤P≤M.
The
i
th
customer will buy exactly
⌊
P
A
i
⌋ candies.
Chef informed you that, for each candy you sell, he will reward you with
C
P
rupees, as a bonus. Find the maximum amount of bonus you can get.
Note:
We are not interested in the profit from selling the candies (as it goes to Chef), but only the amount of bonus. Refer the samples and their explanations for better understanding.
⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer which is not greater than
x. For example,

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M, the number of customers and the upper limit on budget/price.
The second line contains
N integers -

Explanation:
Test case
1:
If we choose
P=1, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
1
3
⌋,⌊
1
1
⌋,⌊
1
4
⌋,⌊
1
1
⌋,⌊
1
5
⌋]. Thus, our bonus is
(3+1+4+1+5)⋅1=14.
If we choose
P=2, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
2
3
⌋,⌊
2
1
⌋,⌊
2
4
⌋,⌊
2
1
⌋,⌊
2
5
⌋]. Thus our bonus is
(1+0+2+0+2)⋅4=20.
If we choose
P=3, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
3
3
⌋,⌊
3
1
⌋,⌊
3
4
⌋,⌊
3
1
⌋,⌊
3
5
⌋]. Thus our bonus is
(1+0+1+0+1)⋅5=15.
If we choose
P=4, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
4
3
⌋,⌊
4
1
⌋,⌊
4
4
⌋,⌊
4
1
⌋,⌊
4
5
⌋]. Thus our bonus is
(0+0+1+0+1)⋅5=10.
If we choose
P=5, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
5
3
⌋,⌊
5
1
⌋,⌊
5
4
⌋,⌊
5
1
⌋,⌊
5
5
⌋]. Thus our bonus is
(0+0+0+0+1)⋅8=8.
If we choose
P=6, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
6
3
⌋,⌊
6
1
⌋,⌊
6
4
⌋,⌊
6
1
⌋,⌊
6
5
⌋]. Thus our bonus is
(0+0+0+0+0)⋅99=0.
Thus, the answer is
20.
Test case
2:
If we choose
P=1, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
1
1
⌋]. Thus, our bonus is
1⋅4=4.
If we choose
P=2, the number of candies bought by each person is
[⌊
2
1
⌋]. Thus, our bonus is
0⋅1=0.
Thus, the answer is
4.
