You are given a range of integers
{L,L+1,…,R}. An integer
X is said to be reachable if it can be represented as a sum of two not necessarily distinct integers in this range. Find the number of distinct reachable integers.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of reachable integers.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The only reachable integer is
2+2=4.
Example case 2:
4,
5 and
6 are reachable, since
2+2=4,
2+3=5 and
3+3=6.
