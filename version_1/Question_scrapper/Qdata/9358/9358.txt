You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers.
Let's call a pair of indices
i
,
j
good if
1≤i<j≤n
and
gcd(ai,2aj)>1
(where
gcd(x,y)
is the greatest common divisor of
x
and
y
).
Find the maximum number of good index pairs if you can reorder the array
a
in an arbitrary way.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of the test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2000
) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤105
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2000
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of good index pairs if you can reorder the array
a
in an arbitrary way.

Note
In the first example, the array elements can be rearranged as follows:
[6,3,5,3]
.
In the third example, the array elements can be rearranged as follows:
[4,4,2,1,1]
.
