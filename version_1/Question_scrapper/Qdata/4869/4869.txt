A number
M is said to be a Mystical Number with respect to a number
X if
(M⊕X)>(M&X).
You are given an array
A of size
N. You are also given
Q queries. Each query consists of three integers
L,
R, and
X.
For each query, find the count of Mystical Numbers in the subarray
A[L:R] with respect to the number
X.
Notes:
⊕ represents the Bitwise XOR operation and
& represents the Bitwise AND operation.
A[L:R] denotes the subarray
A[L],A[L+1],…,A[R].
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
The third line of each test case contains an integer 
Q - denoting the number of queries.
The
i
th
of the next
Q lines contains three space-separated integers
L ,
R and
X.
Output Format
For each testcase,
For each query, print in a new line, the count of Mystical Numbers among
A[L],A[L+1],…,A[R] with respect to the number
X.
