The manhattan distance between two points
P
1
(x
1
,y
1
) and
P
2
(x
2
,y
2
) is given by
d(P
1
,P
2
)=∣x
2
−x
1
∣+∣y
2
−y
1
∣.
In other words, manhattan distance is the minimum number of moves required to reach
P
2
from
P
1
if, in each move, you are allowed to travel one unit along the
X-axis or one unit along the
Y-axis.
You are given an integer
D. Find four points
(P
1
,P
2
,P
3
,P
4
) with integer coordinates, such that:
The absolute value of both
X and
Y coordinates of all points is at most
10
9
.
The manhattan distance between any pair of points is
D . More formally,
d(P
i
,P
j
)=D for all
1≤i<j≤4.
If such set of points do not exist, print -1. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.
Note: It is guaranteed that whenever there exists a solution, there exists one in which all points have coordinates with absolute values not more than
10
9
.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer,
D - as per the problem statement.
Output Format
If there is no solution, print in a single line the integer -1.
Otherwise print
4 lines. The
i
th
line, should contain two space separated integers,
X
i
Y
i
, the coordinates of the point
P
i
, such that
0≤∣X
i
∣,∣Y
i
∣≤10

.

Explanation:
The following sample output for this testcase is not correct, but is only provided to clarify the output format
The points in the solution are
P

(0,1),P
2
(1,2),P
3
(2,3) and
P
4
(3,4).
d(P
1
,P
2
)=∣0−1∣+∣1−2∣=2 but
d(P

,P

)=∣0−2∣+∣1−3∣=4. As
d(P

,P

)

=d(P

), the solution is incorrect.
A correct solution will satisfy
d(P
