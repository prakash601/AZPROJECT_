As a professional private tutor, Kuroni has to gather statistics of an exam. Kuroni has appointed you to complete this important task. You must not disappoint him.
The exam consists of
n
questions, and
m
students have taken the exam. Each question was worth
1
point. Question
i
was solved by at least
li
and at most
ri
students. Additionally, you know that the total score of all students is
t
.
Furthermore, you took a glance at the final ranklist of the quiz. The students were ranked from
1
to
m
, where rank
1
has the highest score and rank
m
has the lowest score. Ties were broken arbitrarily.
You know that the student at rank
pi
had a score of
si
for
1≤i≤q
.
You wonder if there could have been a huge tie for first place. Help Kuroni determine the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank
1
, and the maximum possible score for rank
1
achieving this maximum number of students.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers (
1≤n,m≤105
), denoting the number of questions of the exam and the number of students respectively.
The next
n
lines contain two integers each, with the
i
-th line containing
li
and
ri
(
0≤li≤ri≤m
).
The next line contains a single integer
q
(
0≤q≤m
).
The next
q
lines contain two integers each, denoting
pi
and
si
(
1≤pi≤m
,
0≤si≤n
). It is guaranteed that all
pi
are distinct and if
pi≤pj
, then
si≥sj
.
The last line contains a single integer
t
(
0≤t≤nm
), denoting the total score of all students.
Output
Output two integers: the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank
1
, and the maximum possible score for rank
1
achieving this maximum number of students. If there is no valid arrangement that fits the given data, output
−1
−1
.

Note
For the first sample, here is one possible arrangement that fits the data:
Students
1
and
2
both solved problems
1
and
2
.
Student
3
solved problems
2
and
3
.
Student
4
solved problem
4
.
The total score of all students is
T=7
. Note that the scores of the students are
2
,
2
,
2
and
1
respectively, which satisfies the condition that the student at rank
4
gets exactly
1
point. Finally,
3
students tied for first with a maximum score of
2
, and it can be proven that we cannot do better with any other arrangement.
