Chef has a binary string
S of length
N.
Chef can perform the following operation on the string:
Choose any substring of
S;
Remove the chosen substring from
S;
Concatenate the remaining parts of the string
S, obtained after removing the substring.
Find the length of the longest prefix having all
1s you can achieve, by performing the above operation at most once.
Note: A prefix of a string is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from the end of string
S.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the length of the binary string.
The next line contains the binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, print in a new line, the length of the longest prefix having all
1s you can achieve, by performing the operation at most once.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can choose the substring
S[2,2]=0. On removal of the substring, the remaining parts are
1 and
10. On concatenating these parts, the final string obtained is
110.
The longest prefix in the final string having all
1s is
11, having a length
2.
It can be proven that we cannot obtain a prefix of length greater than
2 having all
1s using at most one operation.
Test case
2: Chef can choose the substring
S[1,4]=0110. On removal of the substring, the remaining part is
11.
The longest prefix in the final string having all
1s is
11, having a length
2.
It can be proven that we cannot obtain a prefix of length greater than
2 having all
1s using at most one operation.
Test case
3: Chef can choose the substring
S[1,6]=010110. On removal of the substring, the remaining part is
11101.
The longest prefix in the final string having all
1s is
111, having a length
3.
It can be proven that we cannot obtain a prefix of length greater than
3 having all
1s using at most one operation.
