A tuple
(a,b,c) is considered good if it consists of three prime numbers
a,
b and
c such that
a<b<c≤N and
a+b=c.
Two tuples are considered different if they differ in at least one position. Given
N, find the number of good tuples that can be formed by integers from
1 to
N.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The following
T lines contain a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good tuples which can be formed using integers from
1 to
N.

Explanation:
Example case 1: There are no good tuples.
(1,2,3) is not a good tuple since
1 is not prime.
Example case 2:
(2,3,5) is a good tuple since
2,
3 and
5 are prime and
2+3=5.
