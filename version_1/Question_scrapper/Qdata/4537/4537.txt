Roman has no idea, why this problem is called Stone. He also has no idea on how to solve the followong problem: given array of N integers A and a number K. During a turn the maximal value over all Ai is chosen, let's call it MAX. Then Ai = MAX - Ai is done for every 1 <= i <= N. Help Roman to find out how will the array look like after K turns.
Input
The numbers N and K are given in the first line of an input. Then N integers are given in the second line which denote the array A.
Output
Output N numbers on a single line. It should be the array A after K turns.
Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= K <= 109
Ai does not exceed 2 * 109 by it's absolute value.
