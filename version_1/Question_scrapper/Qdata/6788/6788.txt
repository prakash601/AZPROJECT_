"Say my Name".
Todd Alquist is being taught the process of cooking methamphetamine, but to see whether he's really capable of learning it, Walt gives him a problem to solve. Since he can't solve it, he asks you for help.
You are given a tree with
N vertices (numbered
1 through
N), rooted at the vertex
1. There is an integer written at each vertex; for each valid
i, the value of vertex
i is
A
i.There also exists a special integer
K.
Choose any leaf node, denoted by
X, and go down a simple path from
root to
X.
Let
S denote the set of all nodes lying on the simple path from
root to
X.
For all
i
ϵ
S, choose an integer
D
ϵ
.
Informally, for every node
i lying on the simple path from
root to
X, you have to choose an integer
D such that
2
A[i]−1
≤D<2
A[i]
.
You now have to perform one of the two following operations :
1. Bitwise XOR of all chosen integers.
2. Bitwise AND of all chosen integers.
You have to determine whether you can choose the values in such a way that after performing one of the given operations you can get an integer equal to
K.
Note : A leaf is a node of the tree without any child nodes.
Determine if it is possible to obtain the value
K by performing the given operations.
###Input:
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains two space separated integers
N,K denoting the number of nodes and the value of the special integer .
N−1 lines follow , each line contains two space separated integers
u,v denoting an edge between
u and
v.
A single line follows containing
N space separated integers denoting the value of nodes.
###Output: For each testcase, output in a single line "YES"(without quotes) or "NO"(without quotes).
###Constraints
1≤T≤10000
2≤N≤5∗10

1≤K≤10
18
1≤u,v≤N
1≤A[i]≤64
Sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed 1e6. ###Sample Input: 1 6 85 1 2 2 3 2 4 4 5 3 6 3 5 4 7 1 9
###Sample Output: YES
###EXPLANATION: There are two leaf nodes, 5 and 6 considering path from root to 5 we have nodes 1->2->4->5 we can select the values 5,26,75,1 and perform operation 1 that is XOR of all numbers to get 85
