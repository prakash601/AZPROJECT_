Explanation:
Test case
1: You obtain
4 credits for each of the RTP courses, accounting for
4⋅6=24 credits. You also obtain
2 credits for each audit course, accounting for
2⋅6=12 credits. Finally, you get
0 credits for each of the non-RTP courses, accounting for
0⋅5=0 credits. This accounts for a total of
24+12+0=36 credits.
Test case
2: You obtain
4 credits for each of the RTP courses, accounting for
4⋅8=32 credits. You also obtain
2 credits for each audit course, accounting for
2⋅7=14 credits. Finally, you get
0 credits for each of the non-RTP courses, accounting for
0⋅2=0 credits. This accounts for a total of
32+14+0=46 credits.
Test case
3: You obtain
4 credits for each of the RTP courses, accounting for
4⋅9=36 credits. You also obtain
2 credits for each audit course, accounting for
2⋅3=6 credits. Finally, you get
0 credits for each of the non-RTP courses, accounting for
0⋅8=0 credits. This accounts for a total of
36+6+0=42 credits.
Test case
4: You obtain
4 credits for each of the RTP courses, accounting for
4⋅9=36 credits. You also obtain
2 credits for each audit course, accounting for
2⋅2=4 credits. Finally, you get
0 credits for each of the non-RTP courses, accounting for
0⋅4=0 credits. This accounts for a total of
36+4+0=40 credits.
