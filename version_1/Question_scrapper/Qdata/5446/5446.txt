Chef has two arrays
A and
B of the same size
N.
In one operation, Chef can:
Choose an index
i
(1≤i≤N) and swap the elements
A
i
and
B
i
.
Chef came up with a task to find the minimum possible value of (
A
max
−A
min
) after performing the swap operation any (possibly zero) number of times.
Since Chef is busy, can you help him solve this task?
Note that
A
max
and
A
min
denote the maximum and minimum elements of the array
A respectively.
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N — the number of elements in each array.
The second line consists of
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the elements of the array
A.
The third line consists of
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
denoting the elements of the array
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum possible value of (
A
max
−A
min
) in the array
A after doing swap operation any number of times.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef can make the following operations:
Operation
1: Choose
i=1 and swap
A
1
with
B
1
.
By doing the above operations, array
A becomes
[2,2]. Here
(A
max
−A
min
)=0. It can be shown that this is the minimum value possible.
Test case
2: Chef can make the following operations:
Operation
1: Choose
i=1 and swap
A
1
with
B
1
.
Operation
2: Choose
i=2 and swap
A
2
with
B
2
.
By doing the above operations, array
A becomes
[2,3,3]. Here
(A
max
−A
min
)=1. It can be shown that this is the minimum value possible.
Test case
3: Chef can make the following operations:
Operation
1: Choose
i=2 and swap
A
2
with
B
2
.
Operation
2: Choose
i=3 and swap
A
3
with
B
3
.
By doing the above operations, array
A becomes
[4,3,4,1]. Here
(A
max
−A
min
)=3. It can be shown that this is the minimum value possible.
