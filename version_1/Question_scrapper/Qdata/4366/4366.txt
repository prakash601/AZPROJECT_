Chef has two integers
A and
B.
Chef wants to find the minimum value of
lcm(A,X)−gcd(B,X) where
X is any positive integer.
Help him determine this value.
Note:
gcd(P,Q) denotes the greatest common divisor of
P and
Q and
lcm(P,Q) denotes the least common multiple of
P and
Q.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
and
— the integers mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum value of
lcm(A,X)−gcd(B,X).

Explanation:
Test case
1: For
X=6:
lcm(12,6)−gcd(15,6)=12−3=9 which is the minimum value required.
Test case
2: For
X=50:
lcm(5,50)−gcd(50,50)=50−50=0 which is the minimum value required.
Test case
3: For
X=1:
lcm(9,1)−gcd(11,1)=9−1=8 which is the minimum value required.
