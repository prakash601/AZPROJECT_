A great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level are consumed by the next level.
Suppose in Chefland the energy reduces by a factor of
K, i.e, if initially, the energy is
X, then the transfer of energy to the next tropic level is
⌊
K
X
⌋. This limits the length of foodchain which is defined to be the highest level receiving non-zero energy.
E is the energy at the lowest tropic level. Given
E and
K for an ecosystem, find the maximum length of foodchain.
Note:
⌊x⌋ denoted the floor function, and it returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to
x (i.e rounds down to the nearest integer). For example,
⌊1.4⌋=1,
⌊5⌋=5,
⌊−1.5⌋=−2,
⌊−3⌋=−3 ,
⌊0⌋=0.
Input Format
First line will contain
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers
E,K.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Explanation:
TestCase
1: The energy at first level is
5 units. For the second level energy becomes
⌊
3
5
⌋=1 units. So the length of foodchain is
2 since from the next level onwards
0 units of energy will be received.
TestCase
3: The energy at different levels is:
Level
1-
10 units
Level
2-
⌊
2
10
⌋=5 units
Level
3-
⌊
2
5
⌋=2 units
Level
4-
⌊
2
2
⌋=1 units
Level
5-
⌊
2
1
⌋=0 units
So the answer is
4, since it is the last level to receive non-zero energy.
