You are given a sequence of integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
You should choose an arbitrary (possibly empty) subsequence of
A and multiply each element of this subsequence by
−1. The resulting sequence should satisfy the following condition: the sum of elements of any contiguous subsequence with length greater than 1 is strictly positive.
You should minimise the sum of elements of the resulting sequence. Find one such sequence with the minimum possible sum.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing
N space-separated integers
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
N
. For each valid
i,
B
i
must be equal to either
A
i
(the sign of this element did not change) or
−A
i
(the sign of this element changed).
If there is more than one answer, you may output any one.

Explanation:
Example case 1: If we change only the sign of
A
3
, we get a sequence
{4,3,−1,2} with sum
8. This sequence is valid because the sums of all its contiguous subsequences with length
>1 are positive. (For example, the sum of elements of the contiguous subsequence
{A
3
,A
4
} equals
−1+2=1>0.)
There are only two valid sequences
{4,3,−1,2} and
{4,3,1,2} with sums
8 and
10 respectively, so this sequence has the smallest possible sum.
For instance, the sequence
{4,−3,1,2} isn't valid, because the sum of
{A
2
,A
3
,A
4
} equals
−3+1+2=0≤0.
