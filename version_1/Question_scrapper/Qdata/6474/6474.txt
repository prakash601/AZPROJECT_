A Dr.D’s Legacy Original
Dr.D wishes to choose exactly
K distinct integers from a given interval
[L,R] in such a way that the bitwise AND of the chosen integers is maximum possible. Find this maximum value.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
L,
R and
K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of the bitwise AND.
