JJ loves playing with averages. He has an array
A of length
N. He wants to divide the array
A into two non-empty subsets
P and
Q such that the value of
mean(P)+mean(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each
A
i
must belong to either subset
P or subset
Q).
Help him find this maximum value of
mean(P)+mean(Q).
As a reminder, the mean of a subset
X of size
M is defined as:
mean(X)=
M
∑
i=1
M
X
i
.
For example,
mean([3,1,4,5])=
4
3+1+4+5
=3.25.
Input Format
The first line contains
- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N - the size of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.

Output the largest value of
mean(P)+mean(Q).

Explanation:
Test case-1: We can divide the two elements into two non-empty subsets
P and
Q as follows:
P=[4],
Q=[5].
Therefore,
mean(P)+mean(Q)=9.
Test case-2: In whatever way we divide the elements of the array, mean of both the subsets will always be
2.
Therefore,
mean(P)+mean(Q)=4.
