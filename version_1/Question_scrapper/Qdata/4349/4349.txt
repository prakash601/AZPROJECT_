JJ has an array
A of size
N. He can perform the following operations on the array at most
K times:
Set
A
i
:=A
i+1
where
1≤i≤N−1
Set
A
i
:=A
i−1
where
2≤i≤N
He wants to maximize the value of the minimum element of the array
A. Formally, he wants to maximize the value of
1≤i≤N
min
A
i
.
Can you help him do so?
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K - the size of the array
A and the maximum number of operations allowed respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum value of the minimum element of the array
A that can be obtained after applying the given operation at most
K times.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: We can perform the following operations (in the following order):
Set
A
2
:=A
1
. Array
A becomes
[5,5,3,2,1]
Set
A
3
:=A
2
. Array
A becomes
[5,5,5,2,1]
Set
A
4
:=A
3
. Array
A becomes
[5,5,5,5,1]
Set
A
5
:=A
4
. Array
A becomes
[5,5,5,5,5]
Therefore the answer is
5.
Test Case 2: We can perform the following operations (in the following order):
Set
A
2
:=A
3
. Array
A becomes
[8,3,3,9,6,10]
Therefore the answer is
3.
Test Case 3: We can perform the following operations (in the following order):
Set
A
2
:=A
3
. Array
A becomes
[4,4,4,3,5]
Set
A
4
:=A
3
. Array
A becomes
[4,4,4,4,5]
Therefore the answer is
4.
