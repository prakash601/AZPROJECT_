Abhijeet just got his heart broken recently and thus he decided to make a hard problem this time.
The problem is stated below :
A tree containing N nodes and rooted at node 1 is given. On each node of the tree, there is a monkey having information about a graph G.
G is a graph containing N nodes. The information contained on each node is an edge of the graph G .
Now for every node X, consider the path from root to X. You have to collect the information about edges from this path and construct a new graph G'. The constructed graph G' will be a sub-graph of graph G obviously.
For each node you need to find the number of connected component in graph G'.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in tree and the graph G .
The next N-1 lines contains two space separated integers,U and V which means there is a bidirectional edge between node U and node V in the tree.
The next N lines contains two space separated integers,U and V which is information contained by the node from 1 to N .
Output
For each node starting from 1 to N, print the required answer for each node in a new line .
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ U ≤ N
1 ≤ V ≤ N
