Constraints
1≤X≤100
1≤Y≤100
1≤H≤100
Sample 1:
Input
Output
10 1 5
14
Explanation:
X=10, which means that for the first hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 10.
Y=1, which means that for every extra hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 1.
Chef needs to park for
H=5 hours.
So, for the first hour, she will pay Rs.
10. And for the
5−1=4 hours extra, she will pay
4∗1=Rs.
4. So in total, she has to pay
10+4= Rs.
14.
Sample 2:
Input
Output
1 10 100
991
Explanation:
X=1, which means that for the first hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 1.
Y=10, which means that for every extra hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 10.
Chef needs to park for
H=100 hours.
So, for the first hour, she will pay Rs.
1. And for the
100−1=99 hours extra, she will pay
99∗10=Rs.
990. So in total, she has to pay
1+990= Rs.
991.
Sample 3:
Input
Output
10 15 1
10
Explanation:
X=10, which means that for the first hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 10.
Y=15, which means that for every extra hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 15.
Chef needs to park for
H=1 hours.
So, for the first hour, she will pay Rs.
10. And she does not have to pay any more. So in total, she has to pay Rs.
10.
