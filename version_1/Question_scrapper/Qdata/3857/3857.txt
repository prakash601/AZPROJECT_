Explanation:
Test case
1: Chef has no pairs to sell, so the amount obtained is
0.
Test case
2: The amount earned by selling a pair is
0, so the total amount obtained is
0.
Test case
3: Chef can sell
10 pairs of slippers, each giving
1000 rupees, so the total amount earned is
1000⋅10=10000.
Test case
4: Chef has
10 slippers of which
7 are left and
3 are right. Therefore Chef can sell a maximum of
3 pairs and in total can get at most
3⋅1=3.
