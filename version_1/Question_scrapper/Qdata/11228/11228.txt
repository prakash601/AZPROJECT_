You're given an integer
n
. For every integer
i
from
2
to
n
, assign a positive integer
ai
such that the following conditions hold:
For any pair of integers
(i,j)
, if
i
and
j
are coprime,
ai≠aj
.
The maximal value of all
ai
should be minimized (that is, as small as possible).
A pair of integers is called coprime if their greatest common divisor is
1
.
Input
The only line contains the integer
n
(
2≤n≤105
).
Output
Print
n−1
integers,
a2
,
a3
,
…
,
an
(
1≤ai≤n
).
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Note
In the first example, notice that
3
and
4
are coprime, so
a3≠a4
. Also, notice that
a=[1,2,3]
satisfies the first condition, but it's not a correct answer because its maximal value is
3
.
