You are given a binary string
S=S
1
S
2
…S
N
of length
N. You are also given an integer
K. You can do the following operation at most
N−K+1 times:
First, choose a substring
S
i
S
i+1
…S
i+K−1
of
S of length exactly
K. This substring shouldn't have been chosen in any of the previous operations. That is, the same starting index of the substring can't be chosen twice.
Then, flip all the characters of the chosen substring (i.e. change every
0 to
1 and vice versa).
Find the lexicographically smallest string possible after the operations if you do them in an optimal way.
Note:
A substring is consecutive elements of a string. For eg. in the string "01011", "101" is a substring, but "111" is not a substring.
A string
A is lexicographically smaller than string
B, if
A
i
<B
i
, where
i is the first index where
A and
B differ.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers:
N,
K.
The second line of each test case contains the string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the lexicographically smallest string that you can achieve.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤10
5
1≤K≤N
Each element of
S is either
0 or
1
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
3×10
5
.
Subtasks
Subtask 1 (10 points):
1≤M≤10
Subtask 2 (20 points): The sum of
N across all test cases won't exceed
20.
Subtask 3 (70 points): No further constraints.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Choose the substring
101 and flip it. So now
S becomes
110. Then choose the substring
110 and flip it. So now
S becomes
000. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.
Test case
2: Choose the substring
1011 and flip it. So now
S becomes
1101. Then choose the substring
1101 and flip it. So now
S becomes
0001. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.
Test case
3: Choose the substring
01010 and flip it. So now
S becomes
00100. Then choose the substring
00100 and flip it. So now
S becomes
00011. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.
Test case
4: Choose the substring
01010 and flip it. So now
S becomes
01100. Then choose the substring
01100 and flip it. So now
S becomes
00000. This is the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved, and hence this is the answer.
