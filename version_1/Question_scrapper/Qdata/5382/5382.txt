You are given an integer
N. Let
K be a divisor of
N of your choice such that
K>1, and let
M=
K
N
. You need to find the smallest
K such that
M has as many divisors as possible.
Note:
U is a divisor of
V if
V is divisible by
U.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer
T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line minimum value of
K such that
M has as many divisors as possible.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The only possible value for
K is
3, and that is the answer.
Test case
2: There are two cases:
K=2. Then
M=
2
4
=2, which has
2 divisors (
1 and
2).
K=4. Then
M=
4
4
=1, which has
1 divisor (
1).
Therefore the answer is
2.
Test case
3: There are three cases:
K=2. Then
M=
2
6
=3, which has
2 divisors (
1 and
3).
K=3. Then
M=
3
6
=2, which has
2 divisors (
1 and
2).
K=6. Then
M=
6
6
=1, which has
1 divisor (
1).
Therefore the answer is
2.
