Consider an array
a
of
n
positive integers.
You may perform the following operation:
select two indices
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
), then
decrease all elements
al,al+1,…,ar
by
1
.
Let's call
f(a)
the minimum number of operations needed to change array
a
into an array of
n
zeros.
Determine if for all permutations
†
b
of
a
,
f(a)≤f(b)
is true.
†
An array
b
is a permutation of an array
a
if
b
consists of the elements of
a
in arbitrary order. For example,
[4,2,3,4]
is a permutation of
[3,2,4,4]
while
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation of
[1,2,3]
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
) — description of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if for all permutations
b
of
a
,
f(a)≤f(b)
is true, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).
Example
input
Copy
3
4
2 3 5 4
3
1 2 3
4
3 1 3 2
output
Copy
YES
YES
NO
Note
In the first test case, we can change all elements to
0
in
5
operations. It can be shown that no permutation of
[2,3,5,4]
requires less than
5
operations to change all elements to
0
.
In the third test case, we need
5
operations to change all elements to
0
, while
[2,3,3,1]
only needs
3
operations.
