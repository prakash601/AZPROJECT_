You are given an array of
n
positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of
n
positive integers
b1,b2,…,bn
such that:
1≤bi≤ai
for every
i
(
1≤i≤n
), and
bi≠bi+1
for every
i
(
1≤i≤n−1
).
The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
Output
Print the answer modulo
998244353
in a single line.

Note
In the first test case possible arrays are
[1,2,1]
and
[2,1,2]
.
In the second test case possible arrays are
[1,2]
,
[1,3]
,
[2,1]
and
[2,3]
.
