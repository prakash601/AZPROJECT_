You are given a sequence
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
. Find the number of ways to split it into one or more non-empty contiguous subsequences
B
1
,B
2
,…,B
k
such that the following condition is satisfied: for each
i (
1≤i≤k), the XOR of all elements in
B
i
is divisible by
2
i−1
.
Since this number can be enormous, compute it modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10
9
+7).
Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to split
A modulo
1,000,000,007 (
10
9
+7).
