There is a building with
10
9
floors labelled
1 to
10
9
from the bottom to the top.
N people would like to move up several floors in the building. Specifically, the
i-th person wants to move from floor
A
i
to floor
B
i
, where
A
i
<B
i
.
There are
M elevators in the building. An elevator can hold any number of people. Initially, at the
0-th second, all elevators are at floor
1.
An elevator takes
1 second to move up
1 floor but cannot move down any floors. On any floor, an elevator may stop so that people may enter or exit the elevator. Each person takes
H seconds to enter or exit an elevator. Two or more people cannot enter or exit the same elevator at the same time; they must wait for their turn.
A person can exit an elevator on any floor, not only floor
i
. In particular, a person can switch elevators by exiting on some floor and entering a different elevator on the same floor.
We say that the
i-th person has reached the destination after taking
H seconds to exit an elevator at floor
B
i
.
Find the minimum time needed in seconds until all
N people have reached their destinations if they enter and exit elevators optimally.
Note: We would recommend Python users to use PYPY/PYPY3 instead of PYTHON/PYTHON3.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
N,
M and
H — the number of people, the number of elevators and the time taken for a person to enter or exit an elevator.
N lines follow. The
i-th line contains two integers
A
i
and
B
i
, where the
i-th person wants to move from floor
A
i
to floor
B
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer on a new line, representing the minimum time needed until all
N people have reached their destinations.

Explanation:
For the first test case, a possible sequence of events is given as follows for each elevator.
Elevator
1:
At the
0-th second, elevator
1 starts moving up from floor
1.
At the
2-nd second, elevator
1 stops at floor
3. Person
4 starts entering elevator
1.
At the
4-th second, person
4 finishes entering elevator
1. Elevator
1 continues moving up from floor
3.
At the
6-th second, elevator
1 stops at floor
5. Person
4 starts exiting elevator
1.
At the
8-th second, person
4 finishes exiting elevator
1. Elevator
1 continues moving up from floor
5.
Elevator
2:
At the
0-th second, elevator
2 starts moving up from floor
1.
At the
1-st second, elevator
2 stops at floor
2. Person
2 starts entering elevator
2.
At the
3-rd second, person
2 finishes entering elevator
2. Elevator
2 continues moving up from floor
2.
At the
4-th second, elevator
2 stops at floor
3. Person
2 starts exiting elevator
2.
At the
6-th second, person
2 finishes exiting elevator
2. Elevator
2 continues moving up from floor
3.
At the
8-th second, elevator
2 stops at floor
5. Person
4 starts entering elevator
2.
At the
10-th second, person
4 finishes entering elevator
2. Person
3 starts entering elevator
2.
At the
12-th second, person
3 finishes entering elevator
2. Person
5 starts entering elevator
2.
At the
14-th second, person
5 finishes entering elevator
2. Elevator
2 continues moving up from floor
5.
At the
15-th second, elevator
2 stops at floor
6. Person
3 starts exiting elevator
2.
At the
17-th second, person
3 finishes exiting elevator
2. Elevator
2 continues moving up from floor
6.
At the
19-th second, elevator
2 stops at floor
8. Person
4 starts exiting elevator
2.
At the
21-st second, person
4 finishes exiting elevator
2. Elevator
2 continues moving up from floor
8.
At the
24-th second, elevator
2 stops at floor
11. Person
5 starts exiting elevator
2.
At the
26-th second, person
5 finishes exiting elevator
2. Elevator
2 continues moving up from floor
11.
Elevator
3:
At the
0-th second, elevator
3 starts moving up from floor
1.
At the
11-th second, elevator
3 stops at floor
12. Person
1 starts entering elevator
3.
At the
13-th second, person
1 finishes entering elevator
3. Elevator
3 continues moving up from floor
12.
At the
25-th second, elevator
3 stops at floor
24. Person
1 starts exiting elevator
3.
At the
27-th second, person
1 finishes exiting elevator
3. Elevator
3 continues moving up from floor
24.
All people reach their destinations by
27 seconds. Notice that person
4 switched elevators, which is allowed. It can be shown that there is no way for them to reach their destinations by
26 seconds or fewer.
