Timur has a stairway with
n
steps. The
i
-th step is
ai
meters higher than its predecessor. The first step is
a1
meters higher than the ground, and the ground starts at
0
meters.
The stairs for the first test case.
Timur has
q
questions, each denoted by an integer
k1,…,kq
. For each question
ki
, you have to print the maximum possible height Timur can achieve by climbing the steps if his legs are of length
ki
. Timur can only climb the
j
-th step if his legs are of length at least
aj
. In other words,
ki≥aj
for each step
j
climbed.
Note that you should answer each question independently.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n,q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — the number of steps and the number of questions, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers (
1≤ai≤109
) — the height of the steps.
The third line of each test case contains
q
integers (
0≤ki≤109
) — the numbers for each question.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅105
, and the sum of
q
does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing
q
integers, the answer for each question.
Please note, that the answer for some questions won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).

Note
Consider the first test case, pictured in the statement.
If Timur's legs have length
1
, then he can only climb stair
1
, so the highest he can reach is
1
meter.
If Timur's legs have length
2
or
4
, then he can only climb stairs
1
,
2
, and
3
, so the highest he can reach is
1+2+1=4
meters.
If Timur's legs have length
9
or
10
, then he can climb the whole staircase, so the highest he can reach is
1+2+1+5=9
meters.
In the first question of the second test case, Timur has no legs, so he cannot go up even a single step. :(
