. Consider every pair that consists of:

Explanation:
Example case 1: No pair of subsequences, containing one of the longest non-decreasing subsequences and one of longest non-increasing subsequences have a number in common. Hence, the answer is
0.
Example case 2: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is
1 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence
{1,2,3,4} and the longest non-increasing subsequence
{6,5,2}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is
{2}.
Example case 3: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is
3 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence
{2,3,3,3,7} and the longest non-increasing subsequence
{5,3,3,3}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is
{3,3,3}.
Example case 4: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is
2 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence
{1,4,4,5} and the longest non-increasing subsequence
{6,4,4}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is
{4,4}.
