1≤m≤30
,
1≤r≤1000

n
integers
s1,s2,…,sn
(
1≤si≤1000
);
si

Note
In the first example test, you have
11
bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy
5
shares of a stock at the price of
2
bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of
5
bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have
26
bourles after the evening.
In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.
