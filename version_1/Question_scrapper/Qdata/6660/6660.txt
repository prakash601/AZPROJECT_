Alice Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts is coming to an end, which means it's time for the important OWL exam. Help Alice pass the OWL in numerology, the science of numbers, and operations on them.
The exam paper contains a sequence
A of
N integers.
There are two types of tasks:
Given
i and
X, set
A
i
equal to
X.
Given integers
L and
R
(1≤L≤R≤N), find
X and
Y
(L≤X≤Y≤R) such that the value of
∣sin(A
X
+A
X+1
+⋯+A
Y
)°∣ is minimum possible.
Note that
∣sin(x)°∣ denotes the absolute value of sine of
x°.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q — the number of elements in the sequence and the number of tasks in the exam.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the elements of the sequence.
Each of the next
Q lines contains three integers — descriptions of the tasks:
1
i
X, or
2
L
R, where the first number indicates the type of task, and the next two indicate contents of the task.
Output Format
For each task of the second type, output two space-separated integers
X and
Y
(L≤X≤Y≤R) — the answer to the task.
If there are several answers, print any one of them.

Explanation:
Query
1: We need to perform task of type
2. Here,
L=1 and
R=4.
Consider
X=Y=3. Thus,
∣sin(A
X
+A
X+1
+⋯+A
Y
)°∣=∣sin(361)°∣≈0.017. Note that this is the minimum value we can achieve for any
(L≤X≤Y≤R).
Query
2: We need to perform task of type
2. Let
L=1 and
R=2.
Consider
X=Y=1. Thus,
∣sin(12)°∣≈0.208.
Consider
X=Y=2. Thus,
∣sin(−15)°∣≈0.259.
Consider
X=1 and
Y=2. Thus,
∣sin(12+(−15))°∣=∣sin(−3)°∣≈0.052.
Thus,
X=1 and
Y=2 gives the minimum value.
Query
3: We need to perform task of type
1. Set
A
2
=11. Thus, the sequence becomes
[12,11,361,5].
