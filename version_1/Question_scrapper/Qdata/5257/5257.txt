You are given two points
P and
Q and an opaque sphere in a three-dimensional space. The point
P is not moving, while
Q is moving in a straight line with constant velocity. You are also given a direction vector
d with the following meaning: the position of
Q at time
t is
Q(t)=Q(0)+d⋅t, where
Q(0) is the initial position of
Q.
It is guaranteed that
Q is not visible from
P initially (at time
t=0). It is also guaranteed that
P and
Q do not touch the sphere at any time.
Find the smallest positive time
t
v
when
Q is visible from
P, i.e. when the line segment connecting points
P and
Q does not intersect the sphere.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains 13 space-separated integers.
The first three integers
P

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the time
t
v
. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
