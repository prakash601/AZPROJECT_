There are
N heaps of candies (numbered
1 through
N); for each valid
i, the
i-th of them contains exactly
i
K
candies. You aim to partition these heaps between you and your friend in such a way that each heap is given to exactly one of you without being split among you.
The distribution should be as fair as possible. Formally, let's denote the total number of candies you get by
A and the total number of candies your friend gets by
B; your goal is to minimise
∣A−B∣.
Find the smallest possible value of
∣A−B∣ and assign the heaps to you and your friend in some way that minimises
∣A−B∣. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
K, which is common for all test cases.
The second line contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N.
Output
For each test case, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the smallest value of
∣A−B∣ we can obtain.
The second line should contain
N characters describing your assignment of heaps. For each valid
i, the
i-th of them should be '1' if you want to give the
i-th heap to you or '0' if you want to give it to your friend.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are four heaps with sizes
1,
4,
9 and
16 and two optimal assignments: either give the last heap to yourself and the rest to your friend or vice versa (so both "0001" and "1110" would be considered correct outputs). In both cases,
∣A−B∣=∣16−(1+4+9)∣=2.
Example case 2: There are five heaps with sizes
1,
4,
9,
16 and
25. You can assign the second and fifth heap to yourself, and thus
∣A−B∣=∣(25+4)−(16+9+1)∣=3. It can be proved that this is the smallest possible value of
∣A−B∣.
