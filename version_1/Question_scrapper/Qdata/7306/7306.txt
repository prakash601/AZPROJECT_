You are the ruler of a kingdom, and your cities have been infected with some mysterious disease!
Formally, the kingdom may be represented as a graph with
N cities, conveniently labeled
1 through
N, and
M unweighted bidirectional roads between them. This graph is guaranteed to be connected, and it contains no self-loops or multiple edges.
You would like to get rid of the infection. Initially, you have a cure, which you may send to a chosen subset of cities; these cities immediately become cured. Let's denote the cost of sending the cure to city
i by
w
. The cost of sending a cure to a subset of cities is the sum of costs of sending the cure to each city from this subset.
Luckily, you do not have to send your cure to all cities immediately, since you can also spread it according to the following process: While there is at least one remaining diseased (not yet cured) city, choose a diseased city such that there is a road between this city and a cured city, and make this city also cured (at no additional cost). This process happens one city at a time, until all cities are cured.
To make sure the infection does not mutate, one more condition should be satisfied: the disease must be contained in a single connected subgraph at each point before and during this process. Formally, whenever you are choosing a city to cure, the subgraph created by removing all cities that are already cured (and roads with at least one endpoint in them) must be connected.
Find the minimum cost of distributing the cure to initially cured cities in such a way that it is possible to cure all cities by spreading the cure to them according to the process described above. Also, find some strategy, i.e. the subset of initially cured cities and the sequence of cities cured afterwards using this process, with this minimum cost.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The graph is a star with city
1 in the centre. Initially, we can send the cure to cities
4 and
2 with cost
3+5=8. Then, we can spread the cure to city
1 and then to city
3.
Example case 2: Initially, we can send the cure to city
4, with cost
10.
