You are given a tree consisting of
n
vertices. A tree is a connected undirected graph with
n−1
edges. Each vertex
v
of this tree has a color assigned to it (
av=1
if the vertex
v
is white and
0
if the vertex
v
is black).
You have to solve the following problem for each vertex
v
: what is the maximum difference between the number of white and the number of black vertices you can obtain if you choose some subtree of the given tree that contains the vertex
v
? The subtree of the tree is the connected subgraph of the given tree. More formally, if you choose the subtree that contains
cntw
white vertices and
cntb
black vertices, you have to maximize
cntw−cntb
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤1
), where
ai
is the color of the
i
-th vertex.
Each of the next
n−1
lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge
i
is denoted by two integers
ui
and
vi
, the labels of vertices it connects
(1≤ui,vi≤n,ui≠vi
).
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
Output
Print
n
integers
res1,res2,…,resn
, where
resi
is the maximum possible difference between the number of white and black vertices in some subtree that contains the vertex
i
.

Note
The first example is shown below:
The black vertices have bold borders.
In the second example, the best subtree for vertices
2,3
and
4
are vertices
2,3
and
4
correspondingly. And the best subtree for the vertex
1
is the subtree consisting of vertices
1
and
3
.
