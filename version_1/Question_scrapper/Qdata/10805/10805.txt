Allen, a government secret service, has been assigned to infiltrate a mafia secret base to uncover crucial information regarding the mafia's operations.
The secret base is a rectangular bounded by
(xL,yL)
,
(xL,yR)
,
(xR,yL)
, and
(xR,yR)
in a Cartesian coordinate system where
xL<xR
and
yL<yR
. There are
N
sensors placed inside the secret base. The
ith
sensor is located at
(xi,yi)
and has an effective sensing radius of
ri
which can detect any person who is strictly within the radius of
ri
from
(xi,yi)
. In other words, the
ith
sensor can detect a person at location
(xa,ya)
if and only if the Euclidean distance of
(xi,yi)
and
(xa,ya)
is strictly less than
ri
. It is also known that the Euclidean distance of any two sensors
i
and
j
is strictly larger than
ri+rj
. Note that the Euclidean distance of two points,
(xa,ya)
and
(xb,yb)
, is
√
|xa−xb|2+|ya−yb|2
.
Allen begins his infiltration mission at location
(xs,ys)
, and his target is located at
(xt,yt)
. Allen has the power to run extremely fast in a straight line while he needs to spend extra time to change his running trajectory (to adjust his footing). Although he is a fast runner, he still needs to make sure that none of the sensors detect him while he is running, i.e. there is no point in his running trajectory which is strictly within a sensor effective sensing radius.
Let
P={(xp1,yp1),…,(xp|P|,yp|P|)}
be the set of locations where Allen changes his running trajectory, thus, Allen's running trajectory with
P
is
(xs,ys)→(xp1,yp1)→⋯→(xp|P|,yp|P|)→(xt,yt)
where
(xa,ya)→(xb,yb)
implies that Allen is running from
(xa,ya)
to
(xb,yb)
in a straight line. The set
P
is feasible if and only if with
P
, Allen is not detected by any sensor and is not running out of the secret base (although, Allen is allowed to run along the secret base perimeter). Note that
xp
and
yp
,
(xp,yp)∈P
, are not necessarily integers; they can be real numbers.
Your task in this problem is to find any one feasible
P
which contains no more than
1000
points.
Input
Input begins with a line containing five integers:
N
xL
yL
xR
yR
(
0≤N≤50
;
0≤xL<xR≤1000
;
0≤yL<yR≤1000
) representing the number of sensors and the secret base (
xL
,
yL
,
xR
,
yR
), respectively. The next line contains two integers:
xs
ys
(
xL<xs<xR
;
yL<ys<yR
) representing Allen's initial location. The next line contains two integers:
xt
yt
(
xL<xt<xR
;
yL<yt<yR
) representing Allen's target location. It is guaranteed that
xs≠xt
or
ys≠yt
. The next
N
lines each contains three integers:
xi
yi
ri
(
xL<xi−ri<xi+ri<xR
;
yL<yi−ri<yi+ri<yR
;
1≤ri≤1000
) representing a sensor at location
(xi,yi)
with an effective sensing radius of
ri
. It is guaranteed that the Euclidean distance of any two sensors
i
and
j
is larger than
ri+rj
. It is also guaranteed that the Euclidean distance of
(xs,ys)
and
(xt,yt)
to any sensor
i
is larger than
ri
.
Output
Output in a line an integer representing the size of a feasible
P
. The next
|P|
lines each contains two real numbers (separated by a single space); the
jth
line contains
xj
yj
representing the
jth
point in
P
. You may output any feasible
P
with no more than
1000
points.
Due to the nature of the output (floating point), let us define an epsilon
ϵ
to be
10−6
to verify the output. Consider
Q1=(xs,ys)
,
Qj+1=Pj
for all
1≤j≤|P|
, and
Q|P|+2=(xt,yt)
. Then,
P
is considered correct if and only if
P
contains no more than
1000
points and all of the following are satisfied:
xL−ϵ≤xpk≤xR+ϵ
and
yL−ϵ≤ypk≤yR+ϵ
for all
1≤k≤|P|
(Allen is not running out of the secret base).
For all
1≤k<|Q|
, let
Sk
be the line segment connecting
Qk
and
Qk+1
(Allen is running in straight line). For all
1≤i≤N
, let
(xk,i,yk,i)
be the point along
Sk
that is the closest to the
ith
sensor's location,
(xi,yi)
. Let
dk,i
be the Euclidean distance between
(xk,i,yk,i)
and
(xi,yi)
. Then, the constraint
ri≤dk,i+ϵ
should be satisfied (Allen is not detected by any sensor).
All points in
Q
are distinct. Two points,
(xa,ya)
and
(xb,yb)
, are considered distinct if and only if
|xa−xb|>ϵ
or
|ya−yb|>ϵ
.

The figure above shows the
