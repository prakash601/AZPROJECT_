You are given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an and an integer d.
Find the length of the shortest non-empty contiguous subsequence with sum of elements at least d. Formally, you should find the smallest positive integer k with the following property: there is an integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ N-k+1) such that as + as+1 + ... + as+k-1 ≥ d.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and d.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence with sum of elements ≥ d. If there is no such subsequence, print -1 instead.
